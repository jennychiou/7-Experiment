Booked himself a room in the local saloon

And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room

But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner


Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)

Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)

Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)

No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?
And I'm always hearing voices on the street
I want to shout, but I can hardly speak
I was making love last night to a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
Because she come every time that she pirouettes over me

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fucking feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the nasty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene, oh
It's all mesmerized, all that inside me, oh

The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows, moonlight mystery

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping

Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
And says, I've won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack

I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud

Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

I say, ""Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?""
A voice says, ""Hi, hello, how are you?""
Well, I guess I'm doing fine
It's three a.m., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed
Because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head

I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby""

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag
Stuck on my windscreen

I said, ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd

The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
Just another mad, mad day on the road
I am just living to be lying by your side
But I’m just about a moonlight mile on down the road

Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
Going to warm my bones, going to warm my bones
I’ve got silence on my radio
Let the air waves flow, let the air waves flow

For I am sleeping under strange, strange skies
Just another mad, mad day on the road
My dreams is fading down the railway line
I’m just about a moonlight mile on down the road

That lights the face so cold

It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh


It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, oooh, oh, oh

Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah"

You know that Annie's back in town

How the fellas lay their money down

Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah
I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it


Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times

But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me

Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby
Did it feel so good?
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me

And starts to climb towards the light

By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you
And what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun


Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky"

You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer


And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

(Stone, stone, stone...)

Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer


Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone

And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon

I'm causing a mild sensation with this new occupation
I'm permanently glued to this extraordinary mood
So now move over and let me take over
With my melancholy blues

I'm just getting used to my new exposure
So come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues"

Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there

He lays her down, he frowns
""Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?""

She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries ""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?""

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)

She wants the young American

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
""We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

(All night)
All night, you want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon

I'm gonna say goodbye he says, yeah
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye, yeah

They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all
Listen

Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river's bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with Satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the Devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me

And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for

Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane

You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use

And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

And he was alright

Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay

And he was alright

Portraying Himmler's sacred realm

I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!

I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it then she can do it
She don't make false claims
But she's a Queen and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains

Oh, the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all

And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab

Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
And give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend

Could send her home again

Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
Spoken:
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each of us must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange
And why I've never know
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"
Rock,Elvis Presley,1969,From Elvis In Memphis,In The Ghetto,"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

And as her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
In the ghetto"

Back in nineteen-fifty-five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
An' all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news

He said, ""Let there be sound""
There was sound
""Let there be light""
There was light
""Let there be drums""
There was drums
""Let there be guitar""
There was guitar

Oh, let there be rock


And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
And all across the land, every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar, there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen-million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say:

""Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar""

Oh, let there be rock


One night, in the club called, ""The Shaking Hand""
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good, and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty

Well, I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no, nothing
So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down

When they used to be new
When they used to be clean
But I've got a Mamma who's a hummer
Just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band, doin' drinking with the boys
She's working 9-to-5
(She knows her place, that woman)
Just you wait
One of these days, see me driving 'round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sunroof down

While they're banging out front inside they're slamming to the crunch
Go on an throw me to the lions and the whole damn screaming bunch

Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear, they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me


Into ruin, I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Fearing no one was listening to you

The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call

Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep, I have broken away

Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free

And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you’ll sink like a stone

Come writers and critics, who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won’t come again
And don’t speak too soon
For the wheel’s still in spin
And there’s no tellin' who that it’s namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'

Don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls

Please get outta' the new one if you can’t lend your hand

You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

Rock,Bob Dylan,1997,Time Out of Mind,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love"

In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1965,Highway 61 Revisited,Desolation Row,"They’re selling postcards of the hanging
They’re painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They’ve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad, they’re restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row
Cinderella, she seems so easy
""It takes one to know one"", she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
“You Belong to Me I Believe”
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend
You'd better leave”
And the only sound that’s left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
He’s getting ready for the show
He’s going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row
Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession’s her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah’s great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They’re trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
“Have Mercy on His Soul”
They all play on the pennywhistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
They’re getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
“Get outta here if you don’t know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row”
At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody’s shouting
“Which side are you on?”
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain’s tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kinda joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can’t read too good
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1965,Bringing It All Back Home,"It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)","Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan, but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more
Person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons, great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without lookin' too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime, life outside goes on
All around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he, or she, or them, or it
That you belong to

But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destiny
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And say ""God bless him""

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in

But I mean no harm, nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon 'em naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, okay, I've had enough
What else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1965,Bringing It All Back Home,"It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue","You must leave now

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1975,Blood on the Tracks,Idiot Wind,"Someone’s got it in for me
They’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick
But when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray
And took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky

People see me all the time
And they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas
Images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday
You had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years
You didn’t know me any better than that
Sweet lady

Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I ran into the fortune-teller
Who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven’t known peace and quiet
For so long, I can’t remember what it’s like
There’s a lone soldier on the cross
Smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done
In the final end he won the war
After losing every battle

I woke up on the roadside
Daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
Shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best
And cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch
Flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Idiot wind
Blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

It was gravity which pulled us down
And destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
But it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down
As a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good
You’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom

I noticed at the ceremony
Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can’t remember your face anymore
Your mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone-faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards
Near the cypress trees, while the Spring time turned
Slowly into Autumn

Idiot wind
Blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I can’t feel you anymore
I can’t even touch the books you’ve read
Every time I crawl past your door
I been wishing I've been somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks
Down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars
Hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory

I been double-crossed now
For the very last time and now I’m finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast
On the borderline which separated you from me
You’ll never know the hurt I suffered
Nor the pain I rise above
And I’ll never know the same about you
Your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

Idiot wind
Blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind
Blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves"

There’s nothin' I'm a-wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

I’m sure your mind is a-roamin'
I’m sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you’re goin'
So take heed, take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there’s somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,It Ain’t Me Babe,"Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I’m not the one you want, babe
I’m not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway I'm not alone
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1975,Blood on the Tracks,Simple Twist of Fate,"They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate"
Rock,Bob Dylan,2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,I Contain Multitudes,"Today, and tomorrow, and yesterday, too
The flowers are dyin' like all things do
Follow me close, I’m going to Bally-na-Lee
I'll lose my mind if you don't come with me
I fuss with my hair, and I fight blood feuds
I contain multitudes
Got a tell-tale heart like Mr. Poe
Got skeletons in the walls of people you know
I’ll drink to the truth and the things we said
I'll drink to the man that shares your bed
I paint landscapes, and I paint nudes
I contain multitudes
A red Cadillac and a black mustache
Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash
Tell me, what's next? What shall we do?
Half my soul, baby, belongs to you
I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes
I contain multitudes
I'm just like Anne Frank, like Indiana Jones
And them British bad boys, The Rolling Stones
I go right to the edge, I go right to the end
I go right where all things lost are made good again
I sing the songs of experience like William Blake
I have no apologies to make
Everything's flowing all at the same time
I live on a boulevard of crime
I drive fast cars, and I eat fast foods
I contain multitudes
Pink pedal-pushers, red blue jeans
All the pretty maids, and all the old queens
All the old queens from all my past lives
I carry four pistols and two large knives
I'm a man of contradictions, I'm a man of many moods
I contain multitudes
You greedy old wolf, I'll show you my heart
But not all of it, only the hateful part
I’ll sell you down the river, I’ll put a price on your head
What more can I tell you? I sleep with life and death in the same bed
Get lost, madame, get up off my knee
Keep your mouth away from me
I'll keep the path open, the path in my mind
I’ll see to it that there's no love left behind
I'll play Beethoven's sonatas, and Chopin’s preludes
I contain multitudes"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1966,Blonde on Blonde,Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,"Well, they'll stone you when you're tryin' to be so good
They'll stone you just like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walking through the door

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say, ""Good luck""

Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you and say that that's the end
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar

Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright

Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they're all brave
They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave

May you always do for others

May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth

May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong

Rock,Bob Dylan,2012,Tempest,Roll On John,"Doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
Another bottle's empty, another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They shot him in the back and down he went

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

From the Liverpool docks to the red-light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the quarrymen
Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end


Sailin' through the trade winds bound for the South
Rags on your back just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave


I heard the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut him to the core


Put on your bags and get 'em packed
Leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
The sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long


Slow down you're moving way too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be


Roll on, John, roll through the rain and snow
Take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home


Tyger, tyger burning bright
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
In the forests of the night
Cover 'em over and let him sleep"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1965,Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits,Positively 4th Street,"You got a lot of nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that’s winning

You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it?

You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You’re in with

Do you take me for such a fool
To think I’d make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don’t know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say “How are you? Good luck!”
But you don’t mean it

When you know as well as me
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Why don’t you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them

And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You’d know what a drag it is
To see you"

Rock,Bob Dylan,1975,Blood on the Tracks,You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,"I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to

I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I’ll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go"
Rock,Bob Dylan,2012,Tempest,Pay in Blood,"Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own
You pet your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1975,Blood on the Tracks,"If You See Her, Say Hello","If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so

We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1976,Desire,Sara,"I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me, I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach

Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define

I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill

Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife

Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar

Sara, Sara
It’s all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, Sara
Loving you is the one thing I’ll never regret

I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells
I’d taken the cure and had just gotten through
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel
Writing “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you

Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel we’re never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart

How did I meet you? I don’t know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm

Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness

Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You give me a map and a key to your door

Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1964,The Times They Are A-Changin’,With God on Our Side,"Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side
Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah the country was young
With God on its side
The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side
The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side
The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side
I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side
But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side
Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for ya'
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side
So now as I’m leavin'
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
If God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1975,Blood on the Tracks,You’re a Big Girl Now,"Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh
Singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way

A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart"
Rock,Bob Dylan,1965,Bringing It All Back Home,Bob Dylan’s 115th Dream,"I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have you understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline""
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they're far away at sea
""I think I'll call it America""
I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort
And start buyin' a place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail
For carrying harpoons
Ah, me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Sayin', ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line
Sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight
I went into a restaurant
Looking for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some Suzette, I said
""Could you please make that Crepe?""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilin' fat
Food was flyin' everywhere
I left without my hat
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again
Well, I rapped upon a house
With the US flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way""
""The man says, ""Get out of here
I'll tear you limb from limb""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too""
He said, ""You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop""
I decided to have him arrested
And I went lookin' for a cop
I ran right outside
I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, ""Fab""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was
I repeated that my friends
Were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, ""Call me if they die""
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
And it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line
Well, by this time I's fed up
At tryin' to make a stab
At bringing back any help
For my friends and captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship
Well, I got back and took
The parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid
Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships sailin'
There were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, ""Good luck"""
Rock,Bob Dylan,2012,Tempest,Tin Angel,"It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said: “Boss, the lady’s gone
She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”

“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
Come to the point as straight as you can”
“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand”

The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late

“Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by, put up a prayer” (The Boss)

Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
Eastward, long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went

He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain

Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
He renounced his faith, he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all

He leaned down, cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who

He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair

They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by” (Henry Lee)
“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly” (The Wife)

From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race

She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
“You’re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise” (The Wife)

“Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on, double-quick” (The Boss)

“Silly boy, you think me a saint
I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes” (The Wife)

“I’d have given you the stars and the planets, too
But what good would these things do you?
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you’ll see” (The Boss)

“Oh, please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold” (The Wife)
“Oh, my dear, you must be blind
He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind” (The Boss)

“You’ve had your way too long with me
Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be” (The Wife)
“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed
‘You’ll have to try to get past me first” (The Boss)

“Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you, sir, you can not deny
You made a monkey of me, what and for why?” (The Boss)

“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you, I’ll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died” (Henry Lee)

The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin

He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead

“You shot my husband down, you fiend” (The Wife)
“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?
He was a man of strife, a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind” (Henry Lee)

This she said with angry breath
“You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life” (The Wife)
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife

His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife” (Henry Lee)

“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we’re no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men, as all wives know” (The Wife)
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow

His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt” (Henry Lee)

She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
“You died for me, now I’ll die for you” (The Wife)
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through

All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day"

Sailing ships the Viking spits the blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

And I know you'll understand more when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on

I want you to listen, I'm trying to get through
Love has given life to you and now it's your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still, I look, but not to touch the seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls, the secret stays unknown


Just remember love is life and hate is living death
Treat your life for what it's worth and live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned, but now, I'm wondering
Here, I wait and only guess what this next life will bring, haha!"

Chain the sun and it tears away

Behind the smile there's danger
And a promise to be told
You'll never get old
Life's fantasy, to be locked away
And still, to think you're free, you're free, we're free

So live for today
Tomorrow never comes

Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing on the wall?
Die young, gonna die young
Someone stopped the fall

Again and again, again and again, and again

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights

Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

Neon Knights!

I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should

Superstitious century, didn’t time go slow
Separating sanity, watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker, spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans in disguise

Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should


Watching eyes of celluloid tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay, give, give, give!
Laughter kissing love is showing me the way
Spiral city architect, I build, you pay

Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?
Reanimation of the sequence

Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your life's on overload
Delete or save
The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know which way to go
You might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to lose
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up, resist, and be the master of your fate
Don't look badly for today, tomorrow is too late


You don't wanna be a robot ghost
Occupied inside the human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free
Alright, okay, alright
'Til they set you free
Alright, okay

But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I’m dead

When sadness fills my days
It’s time to turn away
And then tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

Earthquake, always happen when you're in bed, Fred

Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother

When the lights go out, throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don’t you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

Statues fall, democracy is flat on its back, Jack
We had it all, and what we had is not coming back, Zach
A big mouth says the people, they don't wanna be free for free
The blackout, is this an extinction event we see?
Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go, easy on me, easy on me, now

Rock,U2,2017,Songs of Experience,The Little Things That Give You Away,"The night gave you a song
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world
Like you belong there
As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees
There’s something wrong there

Oh la la, I’m not a ghost now
I can see you
You need to see me

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way

I saw you on the stairs
You didn’t notice I was there
That’s ‘cause you were talking at me
And not to me
You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you
Your liberty

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
It’s the little things that tease and betray
Has the hunter now become the prey?
It’s the little things
The little things that give you away

Sometimes
I can’t believe my existence
See myself from a distance
I can’t get back inside
Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died
Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
When the painted glass shatters
And you’re the only thing matters
But I can’t see you through the tears
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes"
Rock,U2,1987,The Joshua Tree,Running to Stand Still,"And so she woke up
Woke up from where she was lyin' still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're going
Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night
Singing ah, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

Sweet the sin
Bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here, singing
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day


She runs through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea
She is ragin', she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still"
Rock,U2,2017,Songs of Experience,Landlady,"Roam, the phone is where I live 'til I get home
And when the doorbell rings you tell me that I have a key
I ask you, how you know it's me
The road, no road without a turn and if there was
The road would be too long
What keeps us standing in this view
Is the view that we can be brand new

The landlady takes me up in the air
I go, I go where I would not dare
The landlady shows me the stars up there
I'm weightless, weightless when she is there
And I'll never know, never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke, it was you that always paid the rent

Space, her place is where I found my parking space
And when I'm losing ground, you know she gives it back to me
She whispers ""don't do, just be""

The landlady takes me up in the air
I go, I go where I would not dare
The landlady shows me the stars up there
I'm weightless, weightless when she is there
And I'll never know, never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke, it was you that always paid the rent

Every wave that broke me
Every song that wrote me
Every dawn that woke me
Was to get me home to you, see
Every soul that left me
Every heart that kept me
The strangers that protected me
To bring me back to you
Every magic potion
Every false emotion
How unswerving our devotion
To the lies we know are almost true
Every sweet confusion
Every grand illusion
I will win and call it losing
If the prize is not for you"
Rock,U2,1987,The Joshua Tree,One Tree Hill,"We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
As the day begs the night for mercy, love
A sun so bright it leaves no shadows
Only scars carved into stone on the face of earth
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes
You run like a river on to the sea
You run like a river runs to the sea
And in the world, a heart of darkness, a fire-zone
Where poets speak their heart then bleed for it
Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love
You know his blood still cries from the ground
It runs like a river runs to the sea
It runs like a river to the sea
I don't believe in painted roses or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful
I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill
We run like a river runs to the sea
We run like a river to the sea
And when it's rainin', rainin' hard
That's when the rain will break a heart
Rainin', rainin' in your heart
Rainin' in your heart
Rainin', rain into your heart
Rainin', rainin', rainin'
Rain into your heart
Rainin', ooh, rain in your heart, yeah
Feel it
Oh great ocean
Oh great sea
Run to the ocean
Run to the sea"

Hanging around
Sick of sorrow
Sick of pain
Sick of hearing again and again
That there's gonna be
Peace on Earth
Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies
They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you
It's already gone too far
Who said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt
Jesus could you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
No whos or whys
No-one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth
She never got to say goodbye
To see the colour in his eyes
Now he's in the dirt
Peace on Earth
They're reading names out over the radio
All the folks the rest of us won't get to know
Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann and Breda
Their lives are bigger, than any big idea
Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
To tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground

But where you want to go

Ask the leaf and ask the bird
Not to sing or speak a word
We are not fictitious characters
We don't belong to this world

The book, the book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
In the book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in
The book of your heart

You can change your name, or even who you are
That's the beauty of the scar
That is the contract of the heart

This is our wedding day
This is the promise that we'll stay
Through the long descriptive passages
Where we don't know what to say

The book, the book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
In the book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in

Love is what we choose to do
Babe you don't belong to me

Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness

Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness

A little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense

Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets, and no one to tell
Take the money, honey...
Blindness

Love is blindness, I don't want to see

I was down the hold, just passing time
Last time we met it was a low-lit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time except you
You were talking about the end of the world

I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world

In my dream, I was drowning my sorrows
But my sorrows they'd learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait till the end of the world"

Rock,Bruce Springsteen,1975,Born to Run,Jungleland,"The Rangers had a homecoming in Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
Over the Jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance
And disappear down Flamingo Lane
Well the maximum lawman run down Flamingo
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
And the kids round here look just like shadows
Always quiet, holding hands
From the churches to the jails
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand down in Jungleland
Well the midnight gangs assembled
And picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
That brings this fair city light
Man there's an opera out on the turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops, cherry tops, rips this holy night
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contact's made, they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades
Hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted
Explode into rock'n'roll bands
That face off against each other out in the street
Down in Jungleland
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone

Beneath the city two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender
In a bedroom locked in whispers
Of soft refusal and then surrender
In the tunnels uptown the Rat's own dream guns him down
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
And the poets down here
Don't write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand
But they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in Jungleland"

She'll let you in her car
To go driving around
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That will bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far would you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

She'll lead you down a path
There will be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
Then she'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away

Rock,Bruce Springsteen,1982,Nebraska,Nebraska,"I saw her standing on her front lawn just twirling her baton
Me and her went for a ride, sir, and ten innocent people died
From the town of Lincoln, Nebraska, with a sawed-off .410 on my lap
Through to the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path
I can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we done
At least for a little while, sir, me and her we had us some fun
The jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to death
Midnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chest
Sheriff, when the man pulls that switch, sir, and snaps my poor head back
You make sure my pretty baby is sittin right there on my lap
They declared me unfit to live, said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
They wanted to know why I did what I did
Well, sir, I guess there's just a meanness in this world"

Going someplace, there's no going back
Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
Shelter line stretching around the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
No home, no job, no peace, no rest

Well the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad

He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box beneath the underpass
You got a one-way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the city's aqueduct

Well the highway is alive tonight
Where it's headed, everybody knows
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad

Now Tom said, ""Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me, Mom, I'll be there
Wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand
Or a decent job or a helping hand
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free
Look in their eyes, Ma, and you'll see me""

Well the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad"
Rock,Bruce Springsteen,1978,Darkness on the Edge of Town,Racing in the Street,"I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She’s waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut ’em up and then we shut ’em down

Tonight, tonight the strip’s just right
I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer’s here and the time is right
For racin’ in the street

We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run ’em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Now some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little, piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
Then go racin’ in the street

Tonight, tonight the strip’s just right
I wanna blow ’em all out of their seats
We're calling out around the world
We’re going racin’ in the street

I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A
I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
But now there’s wrinkles around my baby’s eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs “Baby did you make it all right”
She sits on the porch of her daddy’s house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we’re gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands

Tonight tonight the highway’s bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
'Cause summer’s here and the time is right
For racin’ in the street"

And a style she's trying to maintain

Well, if she wants to see me
You can tell her that I'm easily found
Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge
And tell her
There's a darkness on the edge of town
There's a darkness on the edge of town

Well everybody's got a secret, son
Something that they just can't face
Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it
They carry it with them every step that they take

Till some day they just cut it loose
Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down
Where no one asks any questions
Or looks too long in your face
In the darkness on the edge of town
In the darkness on the edge of town

Some folks are born into a good life
And other folks get it anyway, anyhow
Well then I lost my money and I lost my wife
Them things don't seem to matter much to me now

Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop
I'll be on that hill with everything I got
Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost
I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost
For wanting things that can only be found

How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile line

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Left the house this morning
Bells were ringing and filled the air
I was wearing the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rolling down here

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

There's spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black, eyes burning bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light

I see you Mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancing in a sky filled with light
May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mix with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancing on the end of the line

Sky of blackness and sorrow (a dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness (a dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear (a dream of life)
Sky of memory and shadow (a dream of life)
Your burning wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life (a dream of life)

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight"

You pick up Little Dynamite, I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
Ah, Rosie, you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's, tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, cause you know we ain't gonna come
Ah, I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie, you're the one

Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there
Ah, Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billy, they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So Rosie, come out tonight, oh, baby, come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

Rosalita, you're my stone desire
All right

Now, I know your mama, she don't like me cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room
I'm coming to lend a hand
I'm coming to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't (have any money)
Whoa, your papa says he knows (that I don't have any money)
Whoa, so your daddy says he knows I don't have (Papa says he knows that I don't have any money)
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little café where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear 'em in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, cause don't you know daddy's comin'

Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out

I was stranded in the jungle
Tryin' to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalks bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out

And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
And kid you better get the picture
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home

When the change was made uptown
And the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city

Hard times, baby well they come to us all
Sure as the ticking of the clock on the wall
Sure as the turning of the night into day

Driving 'cross the Waynesboro county line
I got the radio on and I'm just killing time
Working all day in my daddy's garage
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge

The dogs on Main Street howl 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy, no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land

I've done my best to live the right way
I get up every morning and go to work each day
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode
Explode and tear this whole town apart
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart
Find somebody itching for something to start

The dogs on Main Street howl 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy, no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land


Well there's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor
I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm
Gonna be a twister to blow everything down
That ain't got the faith to stand its ground
Blow away the dreams that tear you apart
Blow away the dreams that break your heart
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted

The dogs on Main Street howl 'cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy, no I'm a man

Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair 'til it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
And came out with my soul untouched

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said, ""Sit down,"" I stood up
Ooh, ooh, growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed B-52 and bombed them with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing

I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
But when they said, ""Come down,"" I threw up
Ooh, ooh, growin' up
Work it back now


I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere
And you know it's really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth
But I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car

I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said, ""Pull down,"" I pulled up
Ooh, ooh, growin' up
Ooh, ooh, growin' up"

Hello sunshine, won't you stay?

Those empty streets, no one around

He said, ""Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can

She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (All night)
In the night (All night), Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me


Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right

Into the musty smell
Of wilted flowers and lazy afternoon hours

Got dandelions growin' up through the cracks in the concrete
Chain-link fence half-rusted away
Got a sign, says, ""Children, be careful how you play""

I promised I'd never tell
A half-drunk beer and your breath in my ear

And the wind blew through the window and blew off the covers
Of my lonely bed, I woke to something you said
That it's better to have loved, yeah, it's better to have loved
As I drove, there was a chill in the breeze
And leaves tumbled from the sky and fell
On a road so black as I backtracked
To the Moonlight Motel

She was boarded up and gone like an old summer song
Nothing but an empty shell
I pulled in and stopped into my old spot

I pulled a bottle of Jack out of a paper bag
Poured one for me and one for you as well

They died in the fields and factories names scattered in the wind

You start out slow in a sweet little bungalow, something two can call home
Then rain comes fallin', the blues come calling, and you're left with a heart of stone
Some folks are inspired sitting by the fire, slippers tucked under the bed
But when I go to sleep I can't count sheep for the white lines in my head

I'm a wayfarer, baby, I roam from town to town
When everyone's asleep and the midnight bells sound
My wheels are hissin' up the highway, spinning 'round and 'round

Where are you now, where are you now?
Where are you now?

I'm a wayfarer, baby, I roam from town to town
When everyone's asleep and the midnight bells sound
My wheels are hissin' up the highway, spinning 'round and 'round

Me and Wayne on the Fourth of July
Driving in to Darlington County
Looking for some work on the county line
We drove down from New York City
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name
Driving in to Darlington City
Got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne's
We drove 800 miles without seeing a cop
We got rock and roll music blasting off the t-top, singing

Hey little girl, standing on the corner
Today's your lucky day for sure, all right
Me and my buddy, we're from New York City
We got $200; we want to rock all night
Girl, you're looking at two big spenders
Why, the world don't know what me and Wayne might do
Our pa's each own one of the World Trade Centers
For a kiss and a smile, I'll give mine all to you
Come on baby, take a seat on my fender
It's a long night, and tell me, what else were you gonna do?
Just me and you, we could

Sha la la, sha la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la

Little girl, sitting in the window
Ain't seen my buddy in seven days
County man tells me the same thing
He don't work and he don't get paid
Little girl, you're so young and pretty
Walk with me and you can have your way
And we'll leave this Darlington City
For a ride down that Dixie Highway

Driving out of Darlington County
My eyes seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
Driving out of Darlington County
Seen Wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state trooper's Ford

On their anger, none of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty

My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool
And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan

I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers, always playin' clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin', plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best
Disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball"

Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger
I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver-sparked
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground
Nothing to say, and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony

Sickness can surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go

Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show

Tommy can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
How can he be saved?

Did you ever see the faces of the children? They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean including heaven's generosity
Peeping round the door to see what parcels are for free in curiosity

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?"

He's never been more alive
His head, it shakes
His fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe

Rock,The Who,1973,Quadrophenia,Cut My Hair,"Why should I care
If I have to cut my hair?
I got to move with the fashion
Or be outcast
I know I should fight
But my old man he's really alright
And I'm still living at home
Even though it won't last

Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain

The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt them
Mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll
Let me stay

Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain

Why do I have to be different to them
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend
Have the same old row again and again
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around
I work myself to death just to fit in
I'm coming down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work
He wasn't talking
It's all a game
And inside I'm just the same
My fried egg makes me sick
First thing in the morning"

His eyes react to light the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

There is no chance, no untried operation
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

His eyes can see
His ears can hear, his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block
Go to the mirror boy!
Go to the mirror boy!

Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him in the mirror dreaming

Rock,The Who,1973,Quadrophenia,Helpless Dancer,"When a man is running from his boss
Who hold a gun that fires Cost
And people die from being old
Or left alone because they're cold
And bombs are dropped on fighting cats
And children's dreams are run with rats
If you complain you disappear
Just like the lesbians and queers

No-one can love without the grace
Of some unseen and distant face
And you get beaten up by blacks
Who though they worked still got the sack
And when your soul tells you to hide
Your very right to die is denied
And in the battle on the streets
You fight computers and receipts

And when a man is trying to change
But only causes further pain
You realize that all along
Something in us going wrong

You stop dancing"
Rock,The Who,1969,Tommy,Sally Simpson,"Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire!

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be

The theme of the sermon was come unto me
Love will find a way
So Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be

She arrived at six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said here we go!

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage

But soon the atmosphere was cooler
And Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And leapt up on the rostrum
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
And touched him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be

Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ear
She caught his eye she had to try
But couldn't see through the lights
Her face was gashed and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face! Oh!

Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said
Don't say I didn't warn yer
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild!
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be"

Dreams of the future

And the days are for the sun
All kinds of weather
Will surely come and go
But they're together
And together they will steal the show

And her dreams begin to fade

Nights are for sleeping

Has started changing too
But they'll be together
And together they will make it through

Rock,Paul McCartney,2018,Egypt Station,Despite Repeated Warnings,"Part I
Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
The captain won't be listening
To what's being said

He feels that there's a good chance
That we have been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead

What can we do, what can we do
What can we do to stop this foolish plan going through?
What can we do, what can we do? (Yeah, yeah!)
This man is bound to lose his ship and his crew

Despite repeated warnings
From those who ought to know
Well, he's got his own agenda
And so he'll go

(What can we do?)
Those who shout the loudest (What can we do?)
May not always be the smartest (What can we do?)
But they have their proudest moments
Right before they fall
(What can we do?)
Red sky in the morning (What can we do?)
Doesn't ever seem to faze him (What can we do?)
But a sailor's warning signal
Should concern us all, whoa-oh
Part II
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day

The engineer lives with his wife and daughter, Janet
But he misses them so
Although he's working with the best crew on the planet (We're the best crew on the planet!)
They never want him to go
He had a premonition
He senses something's wrong
And by his own admission
He knew it all along
The captain's crazy
But he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him
If we don't do something soon to slow it

How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day

Below decks, the engineer cries
The captain's gonna leave us when the temperatures rise
The needle's going up, the engine's gonna blow
And we are gonna be left down below
Down below

Yes, we can do it

Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa
Part I reprise
Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
Well, the captain wasn't listening
To what was said

So we went to the captain (What can we do? / For those who shout the loudest)
And we told him to turn around (What can we do? / May not always be the smartest)
But he laughs in our faces (What can we do? / But they have their proudest moments)
Says that we are mistaken (Right before they fall)
So we gather around him (What can we do? / Red sky in the morning)
Now the ropes that have bound him (What can we do? / Doesn't ever seem to faze him)
Prove that he should have listened (What can we do? / But a sailor's warning signal) (Should concern us all)

Seeking someone who would listen to the music
That we were writing down at home

Hair slicked back with Vaseline
Like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
Hearing noises we were destined to remember
We willed the thrill to never stop

May sweet memories of friends from the past
Always come to you, when you look for them
And your inspiration, long may it last
May it come to you, time and time again

Now everybody seems to have their own opinion
Who did this and who did that

Rock,Paul McCartney,2013,New ,On My Way to Work,"On my way to work, I rode a big green bus
I could see everything from the upper deck
People came and went, smoking cigarettes
I picked the packets up, when the people left
But all the time I thought of you
How far away the future seemed
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?
On my way to work, I bought a magazine
Inside a pretty girl liked to water-ski
She came from Chichester to study history
She had removed her clothes for the likes of me
But all the time I thought of you
How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere
Without knowing what to do?
On my way to work, as I was clocking in
I could see everything, how it came to be
People come and go, smoking cigarettes
I pick the packets up, when the people leave
But all the time I think of you
How far away the future seems
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?
On my way to work

How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere

He said: ""Son, I'm going crazy
From living on the land
Got to find my shipmates
And walk on foreign sands""
This old man was graceful
With silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and
He walked four country miles
Singing songs of shady sisters
And old time liberty
Songs of love and songs of death
And songs to set men free
Oh! Eh!
I've got three ships and sixty men
A course for ports unread
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow
Till half of us are dead
Land Ho!
Well if I get my hands on a dollar bill
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill
If I get my hands on a number five
Gonna skin that little girl alive
If I get my hand on a number two
Come back home and marry you
Marry you
Marry you alright
Eh, Land Ho!
Eh, Land Ho!
Well if I get back home and I feel all right
You know babe I'm gonna love you tonight
Love you 'night, love you 'night
Eh, Land Ho!
Eh, Land Ho!
Eh, Land Ho!"

Rock,Chuck Berry,1958,Berry Is On Top,Johnny B. Goode,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode"

And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring, ring goes the bell

You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom, open your books

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music

Back there in the '60s was a little teen queen
Fell then the lassie in love with a lad
Till it took him to vindicate take the feelings she had
She pleaded as she promised every prayer she could
Till everybody whispered to her, ""Lady B. Goode""

She followed him around where he would play his guitar
Till he got so popular they made him a star
Then she could only see him on a TV screen
And hoped someday that he'd come back to New Orleans
Everybody liked her and was knocking on wood
But soon there came a baby from the Lady B. Goode

She wondered if he's ever coming back someday
The brighter lights and glory may just keep him away
But then he wrote and told her ""Do not be dismayed
The love you have for me will never be betrayed
They want me do a movie about my livelihood
And I want you to play the part of Lady B. Goode""

She went to see the movie when it hit the screen
Babysitting Johnnie Jr. down in New Orleans
He saw his daddy sing the song he heard in school
The one his mother told him about the golden rule
Tears filled her eyes when they misunderstood
When everybody knew that she was Lady B. Goode"

Will he escape my soul
Or will he live in me?
Is he trying to get out

Just a shot in the dark

Finally found a way of thinking
Tried the rest, found the best
Stormy day won't find me sinking

I can't conceal it like I knew I did before
I got to tell you now, the ship is ready
Waiting on the shore

Dare to look, face the test
On the eve when you set sailing
What you've learned, what you've earned
Ship of joy will stop you failing


Wind is high, so am I
As the shore sinks in the distance
Dreams unfold, seek the gold
Gold that's brighter than the sunlight
Sail away, see the day
Dawning on a new horizon
Gold's in sight, shining bright
Brighter than the sun that's rising
Three thousand sails on high are straining in the wind
A raging sea below
Is this voyage coming to an end?"

As the far is now nearer

Rise above the obstacles
People beseech me

May not have mattered
Take another point of view

Like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two (That's true)
You've got to believe in yourself
Or no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying free for you to use (OK baby)
I can't believe they stop and stare
And point their fingers, doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them

It's just that they won't see

Is it because they manifest the incubus
The ministry of war that got caught in the draft
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When it's all boiled down and the day's at an end

In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending

Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)

Rock,The Beach Boys,1973,Holland,The Trader,"Hi Trader

Trader sailed a jewelled crown
Humanity rowed the way
Exploring to command more land
Scheming how to rule the waves
Trader spied a virgin plain
And named it for velvet robes
Wrote home declaring
""There's a place
Where totally folks are free
(Happily completely)
Nourishment fills the prairies and the hillsides
And animals stalk the mountains and the seaside
And fish abound the lakes and birds the skies
Signed sincerely.""
Trader found the jewelled land
Was occupied before he came
By humans of a second look
Who couldn't even write their names shame
Trader said they're not as good
As folks who wear velvet robes
Wrote home again and asked, ""Please help
Their breasts I see; they're not like me
Banish them from our prairies and our hillsides
Clear them from our mountains and our seaside
I want them off our lakes so please reply
Signed sincerely.""
Trader he got the crown okay
Cleared humanity from his way
He civilized all he saw
Making changes every single day say
Shops sprang over the prairies and the hillsides
Then roads cut through the mountains to the seaside
The other kind fled to hide, by and by
And so sincerely
Cried

Making it softly
Like the evening sea, trying to be
Making it go
Creating it gently
Like a morning breeze, a life of ease
Eyes that see
Beyond tomorrow, through to the time without hours
Passing the Eden of Flowers
Reason to live
Embracing together
Like the merging streams, crying dreams
Making it full
Begging intently
For a slight reprieve, a night of ease
Hands to touch
Beyond the sorrow, on to the force without power
Piercing the crust of the tower
Reason to live
Hoping
Like a budding rose, humbling shows
Making it
Struggling lonely
Like a desert field, break the seal, make it real
Ears to hear
Beyond the showers, on to the suns of tomorrows
Burning the flesh of all sorrows
Reason to live
Reason to continue
Reason to go on
Reason to live
Reason to live

Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose, and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover

Rock,Eagles,1976,Hotel California,The Last Resort,"She came from Providence
The one in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came across the sea

She heard about a place people were smiling
They spoke about the red man's way
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high

Then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do

Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught them
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And Jesus people bought them
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea

You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
They even brought a neon sign: ""Jesus is coming""
Brought the white man's burden down
Brought the white man's reign

Who will provide the grand design?
What is yours and what is mine?
Because there is no more new frontier
We have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs and
Justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God

And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
Stand up and sing about
What it's like up there
They call it paradise
I don't know why
You call someplace paradise
Kiss it goodbye"

And it looks like the end
And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
You just loved the boy too well, farewell
So you live from day to day, and you dream
About tomorrow, oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To make them go away
And I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind from wondering what
I left behind and from worrying about this wasted time
Ooh, another love has come and gone
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
""Sometimes to keep it together
You got to leave it alone""
So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time

How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man
And she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is
Only given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She is headed for the cheating side of town

You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms
They fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

You wallow in the guilt, you wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter, bringing everybody down
You bitch about the present and blame it on the past
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass

Get over it
Get over it
All this bitching and moaning and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

Get over it
Get over it
It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit?
Get over it, get over it"
Rock,Eagles,1973,Desperado,Doolin-Dalton/Desperado (reprise),"Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
""All you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to
Find your seats?""
Watch 'em duelin' (duelin')
Doolin-Dalton (Dalton)
High or low, (high, low), it's all the same
Easy money and faithless women
You will never kill the pain
Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why
Sooner or later we all have to die?
Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
Four men ride out and only three ride back

The queen of diamonds let you down
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out
And it's fin'lly turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado
(Is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow
(Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust

Maybe tomorrow

I know just what you mean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look alright
If I could see it on the silver screen
You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules

So hungry and so lean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Little James Dean, up on the screen
Wondering who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
And took him down the road to eternity
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen

Rock,Eagles,1979,The Long Run,The Sad Café,"Out in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Café
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom""
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café

Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by

Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind, inside the Sad Café
{Acoustic Solo}

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why, it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café
Why don't you meet me at midnight, baby, inside the Sad Café

Rock,Eagles,1975,One of These Nights,I Wish You Peace,"I wish you peace when the cold winds blow
Warmed by the fire's glow
I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time
And arms to hold you when you ache inside
I wish you hope when things are going bad
Kind words when times are sad
I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind
Cooling waters at the fever's end

I wish you peace when times are hard
The light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low
I wish you the strength to let love grow on
I wish you the strength to let love flow"
Rock,Eagles,1974,On the Border,My Man,"Tell me , how do you feel?
Like you're rolling so fast that you're spinning your wheels?
Don't feel too bad, you're not all along
We're all trying to get along
With everybody else trying to go their way
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?
Just go along until they turn out the lights
There's nothing we can do to fight it

No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain
And we who must remain go on living just the same

I once knew a man, very talented guy
He's sing for the people and people would cry
They knew that his song came from deep down inside
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes
And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind
Called him home


We who must remain go on laughing just the same"
Rock,Eagles,1975,One of These Nights,Too Many Hands,"She's one of a kind
Sometimes hard to find
Like a rainbow
Well, she's lost all her glory
And could tell you some stories
That we all should know

And there's too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
But you won't hear a sound as
She turns around

Her beauty all aflight
It always seems to turn the tide
At midnight
And for her there is no rest
We are doing what is best
For our future
One of these days she may not
Be so good to you
One of these days she might
Shake you to the ground
But her fire is still
Burning
And her heart is still yearning
To be found


Too many hands"

And disappear without a trace
A year from now, maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face

Got to run away again

Rock,The Police,1983,Synchronicity,Tea In The Sahara,"My sisters and I
Have one wish before we die
And it may sound strange
As if our minds are deranged
Please don't ask us why
Beneath the sheltering sky
We have this strange obsession
You have the means in your possession

Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you

The young man agreed
He would satisfy their need
So they danced for his pleasure
With a joy you could not measure
They would wait for him here
The same place every year
Beneath the sheltering sky
Across the desert he would fly

Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you

The sky turned to black-
Would he ever come back?
They would climb a high dune
They would pray to the moon
But he'd never return
So the sisters would burn
As their eyes searched the land
With their cups still full of sand

Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you"

When you live so many miles away
Nothing here is gonna make me stay

I sold my house
I sold my motor, too

I'd rob a bank
Maybe steal a plane
You took me over
Think I'm going insane

What can I do
All I want is to be next to you

I've had a thousand girls or maybe more

Do you want something corny?
You got it
There's a house on my street
And it looks real neat
I'm the chap who lives in it
There's a tree on the sidewalk
There's a car by the door
I'll go for a drive in it
And when the wombat comes
He will find me gone
He'll look for a place to sit

My wife has burned the scrambled eggs
The dog just bit my leg
My teenage daughter ran away
My fine young son has turned out gay
Cut off my fingers in the
Door of my car
How could I do it?
My wife is proud to tell me
Of her love affairs
How could she do this to me?


And it would be O.K. on any other day
And it would be O.K. on any other day
Throw down the morning papers
And spill my tea
I don't know what's wrong with me

Conspiracy

I was blue and lonely
I couldn't sleep a wink
And I could only get unconscious
If I'd had too much to drink
There was somehow something wrong somewhere
And each day seemed grey and dead
The seeds of desperation
Were growing in me head
I needed inspiration
A brand new start in life
Somewhere to place affection
But I didn't want a wife
And then by lucky chance I saw
In a special magazine
An ad that was unusual
The like I'd never seen
Experience something different
With our new imported toy
She's loving, warm, inflatable
And a guarantee of joy
She came all wrapped in cardboard
All pink and shriveled down
A breath of air was all she needed
To make her lose that frown
I took her to the bedroom
And pumped her with some life
And later, in a moment
That girl became my wife
And so I sit her in the corner
And sometimes stroke her hair
And when I'm feeling naughty
I blow her up with air
She's cuddly and she's bouncy
She's like a rubber ball
I bounce her in the kitchen
And I bounce her in the hall
And now my life is different
Since Sally came my way
I wake up in the morning
And have her on a tray
She's everything they said she was
And I wear a permanent grin
And I only have to worry
In case my girl wears thin
Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my, be my, be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my, be my, be my girl?

I walk the streets and seek another vision yet
The echo makes me turn to see that last frontier
The edge of time closes down as I disappear


Always talking to myself

The presence of another world comes close to me

For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt
Digging ditches for the chain gang, sleeping in the cold
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more

And I coming home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on this soldier
From the Florida-Georgia line
When they find me they must kill me
Oh Jesus save my soul

I can't take that anymore

Well these last few years behind me
Oh Lord, have been so sad
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad
Now they say I'm guilty, when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime

Well I'm one of America's heroes and when they shoot me down
Won't fly old Glory proudly, put my medals in the ground"

We dance on the strings
Of powers we cannot perceive
The stars aren't aligned
Or the gods are maligned
Blame is better to give than receive

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose freewill

There are those who think
That they were dealt a losing hand
The cards were stacked against them
They weren't born in Lotus Land

All preordained
A prisoner in chains
A victim of venomous fate
Kicked in the face
You can pray for a place
In heaven's unearthly estate

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose freewill


Each of us, a cell of awareness
Imperfect and incomplete
Genetic blends
With uncertain ends
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet

In geometric order
An insulated border
In between the bright lights
And the far unlit unknown

Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone
Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone

In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions) --
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

Drawn like moths we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight
Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights

In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out

Plays that song that's so elusive

There is magic at your fingers
For the spirit ever lingers
Undemanding contact in your happy solitude

Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

All this machinery making modern music
Can still be open-hearted
Not so coldly charted
It's really just a question of your honesty
Yeah, your honesty
One likes to believe in the freedom of music
But glittering prizes
And endless compromises
Shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah

Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy

Concert hall
And echoes with the sound
Of salesmen
Of salesmen

That no one knows about
He says it used to be a farm
Before the Motor Law
And on Sundays I elude the eyes
And hop the turbine freight
To far outside the wire
Where my white-haired uncle waits

Jump to the ground
As the Turbo slows to cross the borderline
Run like the wind
As excitement shivers up and down my spine
Down in his barn
My uncle preserved for me an old machine
For fifty-odd years
To keep it as new has been his dearest dream

I strip away the old debris
That hides a shining car
A brilliant red Barchetta
From a better, vanished time
We fire up the willing engine
Responding with a roar
Tires spitting gravel
I commit my weekly crime

Wind in my hair
Shifting and drifting
Mechanical music
Adrenaline surge

Well-weathered leather
Hot metal and oil
The scented country air
Sunlight on chrome
The blur of the landscape
Every nerve aware


Suddenly ahead of me
Across the mountainside
A gleaming alloy air-car
Shoots towards me, two lanes wide
I spin around with shrieking tires
To run the deadly race
Go screaming through the valley
As another joins the chase

Drive like the wind
Straining the limits of machine and man
Laughing out loud with fear and hope
I've got a desperate plan
At the one-lane bridge
I leave the giants stranded at the riverside
Race back to the farm
To dream with my uncle at the fireside"

In the dark and brooding silence
Bruised and sullen storm clouds
Have the light of day obscured
Looming low and ominous

Thunder heads are rumbling
In a distant overture

Light streams down in bright unbroken beams

The shifting shafts of shining weave the fabric of their dreams"

Endless rooftops from my window
I felt the gloom of empty rooms
On rainy afternoons
Sometimes in confusion
I felt so lost and disillusioned
Innocence gave me confidence
To go up against reality

All the same we take our chances
Laughed at by time
Tricked by circumstances
Plus ca change
Plus c'est la meme chose
The more that things change
The more they stay the same
Now I've gained some understanding
Of the only world that we see
Things that I once dreamed of
Have become reality
These walls that still surround me
Still contain the same old me
Just one more who's searching for
A world that ought to be"

So long, so long
Then lost in that feeling I looked in your eyes
I noticed emotion and that you had cried
For me, I can see

What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes that only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes that know why?

A lifetime of questions, tears on your cheek
I tasted the answers and my body was weak
For you, the truth

What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes that only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes that know why?"
Rock,Rush,1980,Permanent Waves (40th Anniversary),Natural Science,"When the ebbing tide retreats
Along the rocky shoreline
It leaves a trail of tidal pools
In a short-lived galaxy
Each microcosmic planet
A complete society
A simple kind mirror
To reflect upon our own
All the busy little creatures
Chasing out their destinies
Living in their pools
They soon forget about the sea...

Wheels within wheels in a spiral array
A pattern so grand and complex
Time after time we lose sight of the way
Our causes can't see their effects

A quantum leap forward
In time and in space
The universe learned to expand
The mess and the magic
Triumphant and tragic
A mechanized world out of hand

Computerized clinic
For superior cynics
Who dance to a synthetic band
In their own image
Their world is fashioned
No wonder they don't understand

Wheels within wheels in a spiral array
A pattern so grand and complex
Time after time we lose sight of the way
Our causes can't see their effects

Science, like nature, must also be tamed
With a view towards its preservation
Given the same state of integrity
It will surely serve us well
Art as expression, not as market campaigns
Will still capture our imaginations
Given the same state of integrity
It will surely help us along

The most endangered species: the honest man
Will still survive annihilation
Forming a world, state of integrity
Sensitive, open and strong

Wave after wave will flow with the tide
And bury the world as it does
Tide after tide will flow and recede
Leaving life to go on as it was"

The guillotine will claim her bloody prize
Free the dungeons of the innocent
The king will kneel and let his kingdom rise

Ooh, bloodstained velvet, dirty lace
Naked fear on every face
See them bow their heads to die
As we would bow when they rode by

And we're marching to Bastille Day
The guillotine will claim her bloody prize
Sing, oh choirs of cacophony
The king has kneeled to let his kingdom rise


Lessons taught but never learned

But I worry about you
I know it makes no difference

Watching from the satellites
Take a page from the red book
Keep them in your sights

All that we can do is just survive
All that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive

Ragged lines of ragged grey
Skeletons, they shuffle away
Shouting guards and smoking guns
Will cut down the unlucky ones
I clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed
A wound that will not heal
A heart that cannot feel
Hoping that the horror will recede
Hoping that tomorrow we'll all be freed
Sickness to insanity
Prayer to profanity
Days and weeks and months go by
Don't feel the hunger
Too weak to cry

I hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate
Are the liberators here?
Do I hope or do I fear?
For my father and my brother, it's too late
But I must help my mother stand up straight
Are we the last ones left alive?
Are we the only human beings to survive?

Are we the last ones left alive?
Are we the only human beings to survive?"

Look at me
I am young
Sight unseen
Life unsung...
My eyes have just been opened
And they're open very wide
Images around me
Don't identify inside
Just one blur I recognize
The one that soothes and feeds
My way of life is easy
And as simple are my needs
'Yet my eyes are drawn toward
The mountain in the east
Fascinates and captivates
Gives my heart no peace
The mountain holds the sunrise
In the prison of the night
Until bursting forth from rocky chains
The valley floods with light'
Living one long sunrise
For to me all things are new
I've never watched the sky grow pale
Or strolled through fields of dew
I do not know of dust to dust
I live from breath to breath
I live to climb that mountain
To the Fountain of Lamneth
'Yet my eyes are drawn toward
The mountain in the east
Fascinates and captivates
Gives my heart no peace
The mountain holds the sunrise
In the prison of the night
Until bursting forth from rocky chains

Crying back to consciousness
The coldness grips my skin
The sky is pitching violently
Drawn by shrieking winds
Seaspray blurs my vision
Waves roll by so fast
Save my ship of freedom
I'm lashed helpless to the mast
Remembering when first I held
The wheel in my own hands
I took the helm so eagerly
And sailed for distant lands
But now the sea's too heavy
And I just...I just don't understand
Why must my crew desert me?
When I need...I need a guiding hand
Call out for direction
And there's no one there to steer
Shout out for salvation
But there's no one there to hear
Cry out supplication
For the maelstrom is near
Scream out desperation
But no one cares to hear


The whiteness of confusion
Is unfolding from my mind
I stare around in wonder
Have I left my life behind?
I catch the scent of ambergris
And turn my head, surprised
My gaze is caught and held
And I am helpless, mesmerized
'Panacea ~ liquid grace
Oh let me touch your fragile face
Enchantment falls around me
And I know I cannot leave'
Here's a meaning for my life
A shelter from the storm
Pacify my troubles with
Her body, soft and warm
Naked in our unity
A smile for every tear
Gentle hands that promise me
Comfort through the years
Yet I know I must be gone
Before the light of dawn
'Panacea ~ passion pure
I can't resist your gentle lure
My heart will lie beside you
And my wandering body grieves'


Another endless day
Silhouettes of grey
Another glass of wine
Drink with eyes that shine
Today's without that chill at morning
Long night's time out of mind

'Draw another goblet
From the cask of '43
Crimson misty memory
Hazy glimpse of me
Give me back my wonder
~ I've something more to give
I guess it doesn't matter
~ There's not much more to
Not much more to live'

Another foggy dawn
The mountain almost gone
Another doubtful fear
The road is not so clear
My soul grows ever weary...
And the end is ever near

'Draw another goblet

Crimson misty memory
Hazy glimpse of me
Give me back my wonder
~ I've something more to give
I guess it doesn't matter
~ There's not much more to live

Look...the mist is rising
And the sun is peaking through
See the steps grow lighter
As I reach their final few
Hear the dancing waters
I must be drawing near
Feel, my heart is pounding
With embattled hope and fear
'Now, at last I fall before
The Fountain of Lamneth
I thought I would be singing
But I'm tired...out of breath
Many journeys end here
But, the secret's told the same
Life is just a candle and a dream
Must give it flame'
The key, the end, the answer
Stripped of their disguise
Still it's all confusion
And tears spring to my eyes
Though I've reached a signpost
It's really not the end
Like Old Sol' behind the mountain
I'll be coming up again...

I am still
I am crying

Each one's life a novel
No one else has read
Even joined in bonds of love
We're linked to one another
By such slender threads
We are planets to each other
Drifting in our orbits
To a brief eclipse
Each of us a world apart
Alone and yet together
Like two passing ships

Just between us
I think it's time for us to recognize
The differences we sometimes fear to show
Just between us
I think it's time for us to realize
The spaces in between
Leave room for you and I to grow

We are strangers to each other
Full of sliding panels
An illusion show
Acting well rehearsed routines
Or playing from the heart?
It's hard for one to know


We are islands to each other
Building hopeful bridges
On a troubled sea
Some are burned or swept away
Some we would not choose
But we're not always free"

We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost

When the dust has cleared and victory denied
A summit too lofty, river a little too wide

If we keep our pride, though paradise is lost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost
We will pay the price, but we will not count the cost

All the hope and glory, all the sacrifice in vain

Dark gives way to light a new way
Stop here for a while until the world

Standing with my senses reeling

Suspicious looking stranger
Flashes you a dangerous grin
Shadows across your window
Was it only trees in the wind?
Every breath a static charge
A tongue that tastes like tin
Steely-eyed outside to hide the enemy within

And the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him

Can any part of life be larger than life?
Even love must be limited by time
And those who push us down that they might climb
Is any killer worth more than his crime?

They live for the things they're afraid of

Up at a mountain
Only my own words return
Nobody's up there
It's a deception
When will I ever learn?

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And whispering pictures of home

Wondering blindly
How can they find me?
Maybe they don't even know
My body is shaking
Anticipating
The call of the black-hooded crow

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And talking with pictures of home


Here in this prison
Of my own making
Year after day, I have grown
Into a hero
But there's no worship
Where have they hidden my throne?

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And screaming out pictures of home"

The message says
You left a number
And I tried to call
But they wrote it down
In a perfect Spanish scrawl 

Yet again
I'm missing you
King size bed
(in a) hotel someplace
I hear your name
I see your face 

(The) back street dolls
And the side door johnnies
The wide eyed boys with their bags full of
Money
Back in the alley
Going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail
Of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be
So high I know
If the times gone by
Hadn't been so low
The best laid plans
Come apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams

Sometimes I feel like
Screaming
Close my eyes
It's times like this
My head goes down
And the only thing I know
Is the name of this town 

Yet again
I'm missing you
Won't be long
O' coming home
Until that distant time
I'll be moving on "
Rock,Deep Purple,2017,inFinite,Johnny’s Band,"Ooh, Johnny Jones woke up one day from dreaming
Told Bill the bass and soon they had a plan
He passed it on to Pete and Crazy Benny
Ah, suddenly they had a band
Hey Johnny's Band
He sure knew how to work up a crowd
The sound that they made put the rest in the shade
And the word soon got around
They played every dance hall in the city
Wrote themselves a cool forty-five
With a bullet it shot to the top of the pops
Oh man it was good to be alive
Hail Johnny's Band
Hear them on the radio
Smash after smash now they're rolling in the cash
Whatever they touch turns to gold
Poor old Benny went down with the hard stuff
And Pete joined a cult in LA
Johnny and Bill started going downhill
And the crowds began melting away
Yeah, but hey, it's Johnny's Band
Playing Saturday nights at The Crown
The beards may be long and the money's long gone
It's a wonder that they're still around
But hey, it's Johnny's Band
Playing all those wonderful songs
Making the rounds with that old fashioned sound
And here we are singing along"
Rock,Deep Purple,2017,inFinite,Birds of Prey,"Alarm bells ringing clear
Break the calm before the fall
Bad news travels at the speed of flight
Good news not at all
And here we are again
Playing endless games of war
Birds of prey
Without a word of warning
We dive in to attack
Vengeful and self-righteous
We turn the blue sky black
And a wretched few escape
They'll be forever looking back
At our sacrifice
And the golden sun is rising
At the dawn of a beautiful day
In the name of all that's holy
In the name of history
In the face of life and nature
We are driven by belief
Our faith a crumbling fortress
Once perfect and sublime
Will fail again and rise again
Until the death
Until the death of time"
Rock,Deep Purple,1969,Deep Purple,April,"April is a cruel time
Even though the sun may shine
And world looks in the shade
As it slowly comes away
Still fall, the April rain
And the valley's filled with pain
And you can't tell if I cry
As I look up to the...

Grey sky, where it should be blue
Grey sky, where I should see you
Ask why, why it should be so?
I'll cry, say that I don't know

Maybe once in a while
I'll forget and I'll smile
But then the feeling comes again
Of an April without end
Of an April lonely as they come
In the dark of my mind
I can see all too fine
But there is nothing to be done
When I just can't feel the sun
And the springtime's the season of the night

Grey sky, where it should be blue
Grey sky, where I should see you
Ask why, why it should be so?
I'll cry, say that I don't know

I never felt so bad before
Never, never before

So funny, so funny
Just like a show
One name, two people
All in a row
Somebody, somebody
Someone must go

Help me, now
Please, my friend

I never felt so bad before
Never, never before

I was hurt when I was younger
By a woman who was cold
She took my name, she took my body
And she threw away my soul


I can't hide
I can't hide
My misery
I know my sorrow won't set me free
She did it
Just see
She did it to me

Help me, now

Rock,Deep Purple,2017,inFinite,On Top of the World,"Hot summer night, the working girls were on their way back home
It was getting late so I tagged along, couldn't let them walk alone
I followed them up some greasy steps to a rooftop in the sky
No walls around, just a sea of stars, my throat was getting dry
Everyone could feel the heat that's why we all disrobed
Our clothes and inhibitions went off flying 'cross the globe
Dancing crazy, getting loose and closer to the edge
I could feel my blood was up and it was pounding in my head
So there I was, just me and the girls
Under the moonlight on top of the world
Oh yeah, on top of the world
So there I was, just me and the girls
Under the moonlight on top of the world
As things were dying down we retreated from the precipice
I lay beside the most beautiful girl in the universe
Her name was Venus in Heaven
She fed me rice and offered me wine
I accepted ambrosia and nectar
From an amber goddess
I collapsed between the thighs of Morpheus
Next thing I felt was a sharp pain at sunrise
My mouth was open and full of rice
As I managed to prize open one of my eyes
I saw Luigi the cockroach carry off his prize
And there lay Venus still sprawled out and naked for sure
But not quite what she was the night before
I made my excuses and left through the door
Stepped into space at the twentieth floor
And that's why I don't like heights no more"
Rock,Deep Purple,1975,Come Taste the Band,You Keep On Moving,"You keep on moving
Far away, far away
You keep on moving
Far away, far away

Rock,Deep Purple,2017,inFinite,One Night in Vegas,"Yeah
Ooh, what a night it was, the night I fell apart
I begged a lover not to go away but she went and broke my heart
I found myself in a Vegas bar with a whole new set of friends
Seen through the bottom of an empty glass
Like looking through a fisheye lens
One night in Vegas
It was a morning of revenge for what I did the night before
Which accompanied me to the following day to even up the score
In a stone cold sober mood next afternoon at ten
I found my tongue back in my mouth
I told myself not to drink again
One night in Vegas
I was three sheets to the wind
The three shots did me in
Three angels there above me
As I was lying on the floor
I knew I should have run for the hills
But I still wanted more
I don't remember the chapel but I woke up with a wife
I looked at her, she looked at me and now we're hooked for life
How strange the situation, it's now been thirty years
Since I met that girl in Vegas
Would you believe it, and she's still here
One night in Vegas, oh yeah
I gotta tell you, one night in Vegas
Hey, one night in Vegas
Oh yeah"
Rock,Deep Purple,2020,Whoosh!,Throw My Bones,"I don't know what lies ahead
It's all a mystery man, I heard it said
You do your thing, you do your best
I take a guess at what happen next

All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?

I hear the future is so divine
But I'll just wait until I get a sign
'Cause what I've got here, what I'm holding in my hand
Is better for me than some promised land

All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?


What's the rush? Who's to say?
You can't escape tomorrow, it's another day
I'm hanging here, I'm here on solid ground
'Cause heaven's full, or closing down

All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?
Oh yeah"
Rock,Deep Purple,1971,Fireball,The Mule,"No one sees the things you do
Because I stand in front of you
But you drive me all the time
Put the evil in my mind
Used to sing and say my prayers
Live my life without a care
Now I have become a fool
Because I listened to the mule
How can I change when my mind is a friend of a Lucifer hid in the ground
Just another slave for the mule

Rock,Deep Purple,1970,Deep Purple in Rock,Flight of the Rat,"Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
The message is a song
The misery is gone
Once I had a dream
To sing before the queen
She didn't want to know
She wouldn't see the show
What a fright
I couldn't do it right
Oh what a night
Mystic Demons fly
All about the sky
With memories of a clown
The saddest show in town
When I was seventeen
My mother said to me
Be careful what you touch
You shouldn't take so much
I blew my mind
She was so kind
I could have cried
In my mind
I had to find
A kind of new way
Of being oh so cool
Like a blue blooded
Well studded
English fool
Speak about the past
Times are changing fast
Once I was so weak
I couldn't even speak

Shaking out a curse
Nothing could be worse
Walking through the door
Who could ask for more

Now I'm free
And I can see
And I can see

Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
The message is a song
The misery is gone


Now I'm free
And I can see
And I am me

Please stay away"
Rock,Deep Purple,1984,Perfect Strangers,Wasted Sunsets,"The day is gone
When the angels come to stay
And all the silent whispers
Will be blown away
And lying in the corner
A pair of high heel shoes
Hanging on the wall
Gold and silver for the blues

One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show

Someone is waiting behind
An unlocked door
Grey circles overhead empties
On the floor
The cracks in the walls have
Grown too long
The slow hand is dragging on
Afraid to meet the dawn"

Everybody danced till a quarter to three
Living on the wild side, getting our kicks
How'd I ever end up in a place like this?
Oh, get me outta here
Somebody get me outta here
Three blind bastards parked on a bench
One said to the other, hey who's your friend?
That's how it started way back when
A shit-load of ways to communicate
One hates love, another loves hate
And now you're gonna tell me there's no end in sight
And next thing you know we're getting ready to fight
Oh yeah, get me outta here
Get me outta here
I got to tell you that I'm feeling rough
Been good to know you but I've had enough
You say pull yourself together and get a grip
You can stick it up your jacksie 'cause I'm jumping ship

I can see what's wrong with me
It's in my head
I can see what's going to be
As I lie in my bed
Man is not my brotherhood
I am of the dead
I died as I lived as I loved and was born
On some distant hill
The reasons to hide were the reasons I cried

Fools pass laughing still

There can be bad blood in all I can see
It's in my brain
You don't know the pain I feel
As I must live again
Rocks and stones can't bruise my soul but
Tears will leave a stain
They smile to themselves as they lay down my head
On some distant hill
The blind and the child sweep a tear from their eye

Fools smile as they kill


I got my own way to go and now I want
To take your minds
I believe if you could see
The blood between the lines
I believe that you could be
A better kind
Please lead the way so the unborn can play
On some greener hill
Laugh as the flames eat their burning remains

Fools die laughing still"

Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time
Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now

Slave to none

Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, this life
Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, find you
Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo, wonder
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, story

Say goodbye, my love, I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love, thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Babe, I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with

Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped, ""oooh, that's tight""

Turned a cherry pie right into jam

We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite
Step inside the emotional ride I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary I call my best friend Flea
This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown between us there are lines

Yes I told her that I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day, I would not have it any other way, well
Means so much to me, can you see the we?
What are we ever gonna do when all I want to be is next to you

I took a girl from the underworld and I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done she was not up for the fight
We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind

It's my favorite, so I savor it
I must report that life is short so of your love I'll take ten quarts well
There's no end to this, don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and
Am I crazy to join the lazy zoo
All these human butterflies and cactus flowers swollen eyes and
I want the devil's share of you, I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do when all these animals want
To be just like you

I met a girl with long black hair and she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil and I picked her for my bride
We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right

Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right"

A glimpse of my friend

Incisions made by scalpel blades of time

Selfish navigation with no end
Where'd you sleep? Can I find
A deeper connection
In the face of rejection I'm trying
I'm trying
Evidence in the echoes of your mind
Leads me to believe we missed the signs
Can I try one last time?
Could all use a savior from human behavior sometimes

Shoreline everyday until the
Castle of her ways turn to sand
She holds her lovely breast
As her birds fall from the nest
Flying towards the great northwest, yeah yeah yeah

As to open her world wide with subterfuge

Or you can come to terms and realize you're the only one who can't forgive yourself
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense

Have you ideas on how this life ends?
Checked your hands and studied the lines
Have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light?
Seems that needlessly it's getting harder to find an approach and a way to live

Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings

Then he makes it fast
With one more thing

Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made

He made a home in the wilderness
He built a cabin and a winter store
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travelers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no they never went back

Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river


And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I've got a right to go to work, but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the telegraph road

You know, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your head on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care

But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't want to see it again

From all of these signs saying, ""sorry, but we're closed""

Stealing down a wrong-way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah, here she comes
Queen rollerball
Enchanté, what can I say?
Don't care at all
You know, she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says, ""Toro, toro, taxi, see you tomorrow, my son""
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her, no, no, no
She got her own world in the city
Because the city's been so rude to her

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location

Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely

Rock,The Clash,1980,Sandinista!,Something About England,"(Mick Jones)
They say the immigrants steal the hubcaps
Of respected gentlemen
They say it would be wine and roses
If England were for Englishmen again
I saw a dirty overcoat
At the foot of the pillar of the road
Propped inside was an old man
Who time could not erode
The night was snapped by sirens
Those blue lights circled past
The dance hall called for an ambulance
The bars all closed up fast
My silence gazing at the ceiling
While roaming the single room
I thought the old man could help me
If he could explain the gloom
""You really think it's all new
You really think about it too""
The old man scoffed as he spoke to me
""I'll tell you a thing or two""
(Joe Strummer)
I missed the fourteen-eighteen war
But not the sorrow afterwards
With my father dead, my mother ran off
My brothers took the pay of hoods
The twenties turned the north was dead
The hunger strike came marching south
The garden party not a word was said
The ladies lifted cake to their mouths
The next war began and my ship sailed
With battle orders writ in red
In five long years of bullets and shells
We left ten million dead
The few returned to old Piccadilly
We limped around Leicester Square
The world was busy rebuilding itself
The architects could not care
But how could we know when I was young
All the changes that were to come?
All the photos in the wallets on the battlefield
And now the terror of the scientific sun
There was masters and servants and servants and dogs
They taught you how to touch your cap
Through strikes and famine and war and peace
England never closed this gap
So leave me now the moon is up
But remember the tales I tell
The memories that you have dredged up
Are on letters forwarded from Hell""
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go
Goodbye, Piccadilly
Farewell, Leicester Square

A voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm

Time on his hands the freezing mohawk strolls
He won't go for the carrots

All deaf to protests

Same chimney puff, same little car, same window panes

They tell your business in another Shangri-La
The gas bills and the water rates, the payments on the car
Too scared to think about how insecure you are
Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-La!

That's why she tried to be so hard

And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom

Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi

Because hers was such a lonely life

And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney

And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition
It turned him to the booze

And when his money's gone

Now and then and again
Found him stepping outside of the law
Hey, hey!
And his fortune he had made
Let him live high on the hog
Til the day of the raid
When they hunted him like a dog
He was out on the run
Knowing he could get by
Because the men killed in sin
Were not there to testify
Hey, hey!
He was caught, he was bound
In la casa de calaboose
He was tried; he was found
And readied for the noose
But the break he would make
It didn't turn out so well
And the hombre called ""diablo""

Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats this fast

Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

To live and not to breathe is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away, to find what you believe

And I leave behind this hurricane of fucking lies

I lost my faith to this, this town that don't exist
So I run, I run away to the lights of masochists

And I leave behind this hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line a million and one fucking times
But not this time


I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize

Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken

You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become my biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face

Maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb

You're the cloud hanging out over my head
Hail comes crashing down, welting my face

You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust
Taking what you need, bite the hand that feeds
You lose your memory and you got no shame

Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look to the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""
If there's a God why has He let me go?
As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

Rock,Iron Maiden,1984,Powerslave,Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on
The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm
The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung
And the curse goes on and on and on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
""Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""
""There,"" calls the mariner, ""There comes a ship o’er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""
See... onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two
Death and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
Then... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one
""One after one by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one.""
The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he
And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes
And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins
The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on and on"

And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day

Rock,Iron Maiden,2003,Dance of Death,Dance of Death,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures - they were undead - all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead


When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead"

Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find
See myself in the hall of mirrors

A different mind every step of the line

The artful dodger he counts his stash
The joker’s wild like an impish child
While madame fortune she waits inside
The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search destroy
The ones below human decoy
I need somebody to save me
Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one
You hedge your bets the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck be happy sad

Look in their eyes and you send them away

And he founded the city called Alexandria

He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great

And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity

Now that your faith will be put to the test

Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance

Why am I meant to face this alone?
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive

There'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes

They fire off many shots and many parting blows
Their actions beyond the reasoning only God would know
And as He lies in Heaven, or it could be in Hell
I feel he's somewhere here, or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine, death and war
You know, religion has a lot to answer for

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere, another war begins
And all because of it, you'd think that we would learn
But still the body count, the city fires burn
Somewhere, there's someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile, the world is crying, ""stupidity of man""
Tell me why, tell me why

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is

To wonder if I'm free

Break out of this bad place

I said ""Don't lie, don't say you don't know""
I say ""You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next""

Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire""

Ooh, look out!

You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs

My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me

I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see


My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike

The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!

Rock,Iron Maiden,2003,Dance of Death,Paschendale,"In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you about his years


Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale


Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go


Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale


Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale"

Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet

You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour

The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

You die as you lived in a flash of the blade

When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange

See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

Rock,Genesis,1974,The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,Fly on a Windshield,"There's something solid forming in the air
And the wall of death is lowered in Times Square
No one seems to care
They carry on as if nothing was there
The wind is blowing harder now
Blowing dust into my eyes
The dust settles on my skin
Making a crust I cannot move in
And I'm hovering like a fly, waiting for the windshield on the freeway
Echoes of The Broadway Everglades
With their mythical madonnas still walking in their shades:
Lenny Bruce declares a truce and plays his other hand
Marshall McLuhan, casual viewing, head buried in the sand
Sirens on the rooftops wailing, but there's no ships sailing
Groucho, with his movies trailing, stands alone with his punchline failing
Ku Klux Klan serve hot soul food and the band plays In the Mood
The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand
There's a smell of peach blossom and bitter almond
Caryl Chessman sniffs the air, and leads the parade
He knows, in a scent, you can bottle what you made
There's Howard Hughes in blue suede shoes
Smiling at the Majorette, smoking Winston cigarettes
And as the song and dance begins, the children play at home
With needles
Needles and pins"
Rock,Genesis,1973,Selling England by the Pound,The Cinema Show,"Home from work, our Juliet
Clears her morning meal
She dabs her skin with pretty smells
Concealing to appeal
""I will make my bed""
She said, but turned to go
Can she be late for her cinema show?
Cinema show

Romeo locks his basement flat
And scurries up the stair
With head held high and floral tie
A weekend millionaire
""I will make my bed""
With her tonight, he cries
Can he fail armed with his chocolate surprise?

Take a little trip back with father Tiresias
Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through
I have crossed between the poles, for me there's no mystery
Once a man, like the sea I raged
Once a woman, like the earth I gave
But there is in fact more earth than sea

Rock,Genesis,1973,Selling England by the Pound,The Battle of Epping Forest,"Along the Forest Road, there's hundreds of cars - luxury cars
Each has got its load of convertible bars, cutlery cars - superscars!
For today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
'Cause they disagree on a gangland boundary
They disagree on a gangland boundary
There's Willy Wright and his boys -
One helluva noise, that's Billy's boys!
With fully-fashioned bugs, that's Little John's thugs
The Barking Slugs - supersmugs!
For today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
Yes, these Christian soldiers fight to protect the poor
East end heroes got to score in...

The Battle of Epping Forest
Yes it's the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
And you ain't seen nothing like it
No, you ain't seen nothing like it
Not since the Civil War

Coming over the hill are the boys of Bill
And Johnny's lads stand very still
With the thumpire's shout, they all start to clout
- There's no guns in this gentleman's bout
Georgie moves in on the outside left
With a chain flying 'round his head;
And Harold Demure, from Art Literature
Nips up the nearest tree
(Here come the cavalry!)
Amidst the battle roar
Accountants keep the score: 10-4
They've never been alone, after getting a radiophone
The bluebells are ringing for Sweetmeal Sam, real ham
Handing out bread and jam just like any picnic
Picnic - Picnic - Picnic

It's 5 to 4 on William Wright; he made his pile on Derby night
When Billy was a kid, walking the streets
The other kids hid - so they did!
And now, after working hard in security trade, he's got it made
The shops that need aid are those that haven't paid
""I'll do my double-show quick!""
Said Mick the Prick, fresh out the nick
""I sell cheap holiday. The minute they leave
And a visit I pay - does it pay!""
And his friend, Liquid Len by name
Of Wine, Women and Wandsworth fame
Said ""I'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!
I'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!""
Got me framed

They called me the Reverend when I entered the Church unstained
My employers have changed but the name has remained
It all began when I went on a tour
Hoping to find some furniture
Followed a sign saying ""Beautiful Chest""
It led to a lady who showed me her best
She was taken by surprise when I quickly closed my eyes
So she rang the bell and quick as hell
Bob the Nob came out on his job
To see what the trouble was
""Louise, is the Reverend hard to please?""
""You're telling me!""
""Perhaps, sir, if it's not too late
We could interest you in our old-fashioned Staffordshire plate?""
""Oh no, not me, I'm a man of repute.""
But the Devil caught hold of my soul and a voice called out ""Shoot!""
To save my steeple, I visited people;
For this I'd gone when I met Little John
His name came, I understood
When the judge said ""You are a robbing hood.""
He told me of his strange foundation
Conceived in sight of the Woodstock nation
He'd had to hide his reputation
When poor, 'twas salvation from door to door
But now, with a pin-up guru every week
It was Love, Peace & Truth Incorporated for all who seek
He employed me as a karma-ma-mechanic, with overall charms
His hands were then fit to receive, receive alms

That's why we're in the Battle of Epping Forest
Yes it's the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
We guard your souls for peanuts
And we guard your shops and houses
For just a little more, just a little more

In with a left hook is the Bethnal Green Butcher
But he's countered on the right by Mick's chain-gang fight
And Liquid Len with his smashed bottle men
Is lobbing Bob the Nob across the gob
With his kisser in a mess, Bob seems under stress
But Jones the Jug hits Len right in the mug;
And Harold Demure, who's still not quite sure
Fires acorns from out of his sling
(Here come the cavalry!)
Up, up above the crowd
Inside their Silver Cloud, done proud
The bold and brazen brass, seen darkly through the glass
The butler's got jam on his Rolls; Roy doles out the lot
With tea from a silver pot just like any picnic
Picnic - Picnic - Picnic

Along the Forest Road, it's the end of the day
And the Clouds roll away
Each has got its load - they'll come out for the count
At the break-in of day
When the limos return for their final review, it's all thru
- all they can see is the morning goo
""There's no-one left alive - must be a draw.""
So the Blackcap Barons toss a coin to settle the score"
Rock,Genesis,1991,We Can’t Dance,No Son Of Mine,"The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night
I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said:

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away
In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straght in the eyes
He said:

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine

They call me the trail blazer, Rael electric razor
I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain
'Cos we're only as strong
Yes we're only as strong
As the weakest link in the chain
Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen

I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong
This is your mess, I'm stuck in, I really don't belong
When I take out my bottle filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where Rael has been, has been
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said, I had none to blame, but me
Held my heart, deep in hair
Time to shave, shave it off, it off
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
Off we go, off we go, off we go, off we go
You're sitting in your comfort, you don't believe I'm real
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash
And I've tasted all the strongest meats
And laid them down on colored sheets
Laid them down on colored sheets
Who needs illusion of love and affection
When you're out walking in the streets
With your mainline connection, connection
As I cuddle the porcupine
He said, I had none to blame, but me
Held my heart, deep in hair
Time to shave, shave it off, it off
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape

Except when things weren't going your way
And then the lady would say that she'd had enough
Wandering around on her own

The day you left
Well I think you knew you'd not be back
Well at least it would seem that way
Because you never said goodbye

Tells a tale
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room
To arbours cool
A time of valour, and legends born
A time when honour meant much more to a man than life
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong
Through lance and sword
Why, why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander
It seems because through time and space
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore
A dusty table
Musty smells
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey
That scars the panes
Gone the carving
And those who left their mark
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway
And the weak must die according to nature's law
As old as they
Why, why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander

No with us you will stay
For the rest of your days - Sit down

Let us relive our lives in what we tell you"
Rock,Genesis,1976,Wind and Wuthering,Afterglow,"Like the dust that settles all around me
I must find a new home
The ways and holes that used to give me shelter
Are all as one to me now

But I, I would search everywhere
Just to hear your call
And walk upon stranger roads than this one
In a world I used to know before
I miss you more

Than the sun, reflecting off my pillow
Bringing the warmth of new life
And the sounds that echoed all around me
I caught a glimpse of in the night

But now, now I've lost everything
I give to you my soul
The meaning of all that I believed before
Escapes me in this world of none, no thing, no one

And I would search everywhere
Just to hear your call
And walk upon stranger roads than this one
In a world I used to know before
For now I've lost everything
I give to you my soul
The meaning of all that I believed before
Escapes me in this world of none
I miss you more"
Rock,Genesis,1976,Wind and Wuthering,One for the Vine,"Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one
His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud
I am he, the chosen one
In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied
But they'll fight the battle on
Then one whose faith had died
Fled back up the mountainside
But before the top was made
A misplaced footfall made him stray
>From the path prepared for him
Off of the mountain
On to a wilderness of ice
This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear
Terror filled their minds with awe
Simple were the folk who lived
Upon this frozen wave
So not surprising was their thought
This is he, God's chosen one
Who's come to save us from
All our oppressors
We shall be kings on this world
Follow me!
I'll play the game you want me
Until I find a way back home
Follow me!
I give you strength inside you
Courage to win your battles--
No, no, no, this can't go on
This will be all that I fled from
Let me rest for a while
He walked into a valley
All alone
There he talked with water, and then with the vine
They leave me no choice
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death
They travelled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain
Still he urged the people on
Then, on a distant slope
He observed one without hope
Flee back up the mountainside
He thought he recognised him by his walk
And by the way he fell
And by the way he
Stood up, and vanished into air"
Rock,Genesis,1980,Duke,Behind the Lines,"I held the book so tightly in my hands, saw your picture, heard you call my name
There was something strange, I could not look away
I wanted to be there, I wanted to go
You gave me no warning
You gave no reason
But I was with you
Right by your side
Give me the strength, and I will help you
They can try their hardest, they don't frighten me
It is written in the book
It is hotter than I've known before, but I feel so cold, and I don't know why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Then I really believe, you could make it right
The time has come now
We must show our feelings
But I'm looking right through you
And your heart is empty
Whatever happened to you it's too late to change now
There's nowhere you can run to, no place to hide
Oh you let me down!
...but wait a minute, I don't understand
It's getting stronger, grab my hand
Don't wanna leave you, don't wanna go
But I'm losing all control
Can't you see me slipping away?
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here
It is written in the book
Oh so many times since I've read those words
Just waiting to see you, can you see me?"
Rock,Genesis,1976,A Trick of the Tail,Dance on a Volcano,"Holy mother of god
You've got to go faster than that to get to the top
Dirty old mountain
All covered in smoke, she can turn you to stone
So you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right
You're halfway up and youre halfway down
And the pack on your back is turning you around
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember
You dont look back whatever you do
Better start doing it right
On your left and on your right
Crosses are green and crosses are blue
Your friends didn't make it through
Out of the night and out of the dark
Into the fire and into the fight
Well that's the way the heroes go, ho! ho! ho!
Through a crack in mother earth
Blazing hot, the molten rock
Spills out over the land
And the lavas the lover who licks your boots away. hey! hey! hey!
If you dont want to boil as well
B-b-better start the dance
D-d-do you want to dance with me?
You better start doing it right
The music's playing, the notes are right
Put your left foot first and move into the light
The edge of this hill is the edge of the world
And if youre going to cross you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right
You better start doing it right
Let the dance begin"
Rock,Genesis,1974,The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,The Light Dies Down on Broadway,"As he walks along the gorge's edge
He meets a sense of yesteryear
A window in the bank above his head
Reveals his home amidst the streets
Subway sounds, the sounds of complaint
The smell of acid on his gun of paint
As it carves out anger in a blood-red band
Destroyed tomorrow by an unknown hand
My home
Is this the way out from the endless scene?
Or just an entrance to another dream?
And the light dies down on Broadway
But as the skylight beckons him to leave
He hears a scream from far below
Within the raging water, writhes the form
Of brother John, he cries for help
The gate is fading now, but open wide
But John is drowning, I must decide
Between the freedom I had in the rat-race
Or to stay forever in this forsaken place
Hey John!!
He makes for the river and the gate is gone
Back to the void where it came from
And the light dies down on Broadway"
Rock,Genesis,1972,Foxtrot,Can-Utility and the Coastliners,"The scattered pages of a book
By the sea
Held by the sand, washed by the waves
A shadow forms
Cast by a cloud
Skimming by
As eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them
Effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all
Singing ""Praise him, praise him""
""We heed not flatterers"" he cried
""By our command
Waters retreat
Show my power
Halt at my feet""
But the cause was lost, now cold winds
Blow

Far from the north
Overcast ranks advance
Fear of the storm
Accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne
Singing ""Crown him, crown him""
""Those who love
Our majesty
Show themselves!""
All bent their knee
Aahh


But he forced a smile even though his hopes
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell


""Nothing can
My peace destroy
As long as none smile""
More opened ears
And opened eyes
And soon they dared to laugh
See a little man with his face turning red
Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead"
Rock,R.E.M.,1991,Out of Time,Losing My Religion,"Oh, life is bigger

That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing

Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

Consider this, consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?

Birds and snakes, an aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left of west and coming in a hurry
With the Furies breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common food
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.

Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh
This means no fear, cavalier renegade and steering clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, and I decline

The photograph on the dashboard, taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?
That bright, tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every streetlight a reminder
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night"

There isn't a number, you can call the pay phone

If I don't pick up, pick up
The sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil

Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Oh

There are scratches all around the coin slot
Like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up
But this machine can only swallow money
You can't lay a patch by computer design
It's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs
Tell her
Tell her she can kiss my ass
Then laugh and say that you were only kidding
That way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me

Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Oh

Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me
Today I need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial
A can of beans or black-eyed peas, some Nescafe and ice
A candy bar, a falling star, or a reading from Doctor Seuss

Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her

The cat in the hat came back
Wreaked a lot of havoc on the way
Always had a smile and a reason to pretend
But their world has flat backgrounds
And little need to sleep but to dream
The sidewinder sleeps on his back

Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
I can always sleep standing up
(Call me when you try to wake her)

Talk until you're blue

And nothing's free, but guaranteed for a lifetime's use
I've changed the locks, and you can have one
You, you know the other two
The brakes have worn so thin that you could hear
I hear them screeching through the door from our driveway
Hey, love, look into your glove-box heart
What is there for me inside? This love is tired
I've changed the locks, have I misplaced you?
Have we lost our minds?
Will this never end?
It could depend on your take
You, me, we used to be on fire
If keys are all that stand between
Can I throw in the ring? No gasoline, just fuck me, kitten
You are wild and I'm in your possession
Nothing's free, so fuck me, kitten
I'm in your possession, so fuck me, kitten"

To awkward rhymes

Like I wouldn't know it's you
At your most beautiful

I've found a way to make you

A way to make you smile

At my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes secretly
With every one, whisper I love you

To the north of Kathmandu
Everybody's flying
And no-one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying
And no-one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies
You've just got to lay around

The kitchen and screwing around watching Sesame Street till

Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette
Blew my worries to the sky

After all is said and done, you can't go pleasing everyone

The cries of thirteen martyrs
Filled the free Derry air

Dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding
When they nailed the coffin lids!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

You claim to be majority
Well you know that it's a lie
You're really a minority
On this sweet Emerald Isle
When Stormont bans our marchers
They've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It's those mothers' turn to burn!


You Anglo pigs and Scotties
Sent to colonise the north
You wave your bloody Union Jacks
And you know what it's worth!
How dare you hold to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep Ireland for the Irish
Put the English back to sea!


Yes it's always bloody Sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls and roads free forever
From the bloody English hands
Repatriate to Britain
All of you who call it home
Leave Ireland to the Irish
Not for London or for Rome!"

When I couldn't fly
Oh, you gave me wings
You parted my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me"
Rock,Bon Jovi,1987,Slippery When Wet,Never Say Goodbye,"As I sit in this smokey room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Remember when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat baby
Remember how we used to talk
About busting out - we'd break their hearts
Together - forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong
We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together - forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
I guess you'd say we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together - forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Yeah yeah"
Rock,Bon Jovi,1995,These Days,This Ain’t a Love Song,"I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are ""know-it-alls"" and i played that fool for you

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Baby, i thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

Is the reason I'm holding on

We both got jobs because there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons

Cause you were born to be my baby

Rock,Bon Jovi,1995,These Days,These Days,"I was walking around, just a face in the crowd
Trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if i might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare, these days
She came looking for some shelter with a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be james dean
She's seen all the disciples and all the ""wanna be's""
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days - the stars seem out of reach
These days - there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Jimmy shoes busted both his legs, trying to learn to fly
From a second story window, he just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy - he said, ""momma, i've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And i guess i'd rather die than fade away.""


I know rome's still burning
Though the times have changed
This world keeps turning round and round and round and round
These days


These days - the stars seem out of reach
These days - there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts
There ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
There ain't nobody left but us these days"

Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong?
My life's a bargain basement and all the good shit's gone
Just can't hold a job, where do I belong?
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on
My name is Billie Jean, my love is bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I'm getting paid

And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive

Hey, man, I'm alive!
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Now I can't say my name or tell you where I am
I want to blow myself away, don't know if I can
I wish that I could be in some other time and place
With someone else's soul, someone else's face


Hey, man, I'm alive!
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, I gotta live my life
I'm gonna pick up all the pieces and what's left of my pride
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

There's another one left to climb
Don't go looking for tomorrow
Leaving yesterday behind

Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

We were one, born and raised
More than blood runs through these veins
Cuts can heal, scars will fade
What we had will never change
Seasons pass and time will move on
You don't ever have to let it go
You can only go so far now
Till you're on your way back home

Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

Memories are nothing more than ghosts that we let in
Don't be afraid of them, do you remember when

Kinda always like it used to be
Sipping wine, killing time
Tryna' to solve life’s mysteries
How’s your life? It’s been a while
God it’s good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave

If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory

I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don’t wanna ask

If you go now, I’ll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan

You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory

If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-

You wanna steal a piece of time?

They say what you give is always what you need
So if you want me to lay my hands on you

Lay your hands on me 

I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher
I've been to school and baby, I've been the teacher

I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down

I should have shut my mouth, things headed south
As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb
If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one
I'm wasting time when I think about it

I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words, Did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood

Could I? Should I?
Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night
Staying out too late with all my friends
You found me passed out in the yard again
You cried, I tried
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie
It's not so bad when you think about it

I should have drove all night, I would have run all the lights

And I might forget the little things

Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire we cry

I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true, Baby I'd die for you

I might not be a savior
And I'll never be a king
I might not send you roses
Or buy you diamond rings
But if I could see inside you
Maybe I'd know just who we are
Because our love is like a hunger
Without it we would starve
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget

It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line
To break on through to the other side""

Let it rock, let it go
You can't stop a fire burning out of control
Let it rock, let it go

You got to let it rock

We go down to the Broadway
Where everybody goes
To get on their rocking horse

But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't living with the ghost

Rode waves of amber, let a new sun shine on my face
I dropped the sword, put down my shield
I left your scars for the stars guiding my way
I traded hurting for healing
I must admit that I was reeling
Now I'm feeling just fine
Traded nightmares for dreaming
Go tell your shadows that I got out alive

I saw a man wash his feet
In the church holy water
He worked up to his knees
From his arms to his neck
Said, ""I'm in over my head""

Lord, I'm just trying to get some relief

I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin

Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight

But somehow they drove me back here once again
To the place I lost at love - the place I lost my soul
I wish I'd just burned down this place that we called home
It would all have been so easy
If you'd only made me cry
And told me how you're leaving me
To some organ grinder's lullaby

It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart
It's hard letting you go

Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to
Well - me, these days
I just miss you - it's the nights that i go insane
Unless you're coming back for me
That's one thing i know that won't change


Now some tarot card shark said i'll draw you a heart
And we'll find you somebody else new
But I made my last trip to those carnival lips
When I bet all that I had on you

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn the river to blood
The savior's come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine

I'd turn things around
I would if I could
Crash through the gates
Break every chain
Jail for the jailers
Sing freedom's song
Amazing grace
Burn down this place

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn the river to blood
The savior's come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine

Look what they've done to this house of love
Look what they've done to this house of love
The devil's in the temple and he's making a mess
Got the Mona Lisa, got his hands up her dress
The gun is in his hand, but he ain't gonna confess
He lies

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The savior's come and gone, we're all out of time
Ah, the devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
Oh, the devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
Ah, the devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine"

So no one has to lie
We both know without hello
There won't be no goodbyes
No promises that we won't keep
No more to understand
Tonight you're my woman and I'm your man

Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes

You know it ain't easy
You got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now she's dressing two kids
Looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes

Colliding with the very air she breathes

There's no place like home
Silhouettes on the window

Your eyes flicker like that
Tell me baby
How'd you get the knack
You came to me with open arms

Took you down the track

Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

You gotta live a love

You gotta be part of

Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

They killed us in our teepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Crying on the ground
But the fire sticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun

They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share

I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the morning
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome
And the first teepee

Seek the roses along the way
Just beware of the thorns

And reach out for the spell
Find the door to the promised land

If I had the choice, I would stay

Rock,Scorpions,2015,Return to Forever,House of Cards,"Sometimes I walk mysterious places
Hear voices that talk without a word to say
Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter
In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies
A half-moon away, way too close to heaven
She had the Iook, but no morality
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But there are nights you regret eternally
Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away

How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart
When you get crushed in a house of cards
House of cards

It ́s so hard to find a way when life is in pieces
And the taste of a kiss is so bittersweet
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But the man who'll rise up from the ashes is no one else but me
I'm standing in a waterfall
To wash the lies away

How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart
House of cards

Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away

How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down and there is no one
When you get crushed in a house of cards
House of cards"

Be free as the birds, don't be sad

Follow the light it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings
You've got your songs
They are everywhere for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right
You've got your songs
They are everywhere for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right
You were born just to lose or to win
To be someone's chime in the wind
To live between your mind and feelings
Find your way, check it out
Learn each day
Follow the light, it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings

Your breath of love surrounded me
When can I rejoin you to be free
Wait, can this be a dream
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you, it say's
Don't cry, no need to be sad
There's a way to stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are in my other heart
I know we've never been apart

Make each other really know it

Whisper waves cloud the glass
Awake at last like a lover
It rushed around me talking sweet
Roll over, roll over, roll over
And in my ear he blew his name
It sound so strange but I heard it plain
Mistral, mistral wind
I have always held the wheel but
I let the wind steal my power
Spin me 'round lose my course
Nights run by like hours
Well, it would show me the way
To the deepest mountains
Too high and beautiful to be
Mistral, mistral wind
All the hours on the watch
I wait for that breeze to move me
And blow me back to that place
Magic space all through me

Across the empty water
You made a crazy dreamer out of me

The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes.""

Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done

Only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one

So come on Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling only the good die young

Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
You know that only the good die young

Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Said, your mother told you ""All that I could give you was a reputation.""
Aw, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?

Come out Virginia, don't let me wait

Rock,Billy Joel,1982,The Nylon Curtain,Goodnight Saigon,"We met as soul mates on Parris Island
We left as inmates from an asylum
And we were sharp, as sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives
We came in spastic like tameless horses
We left in plastic as numbered corpses
And we learned fast to travel light
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight
We had no home front, we had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy, they gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep and shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might
We had no cameras to shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe and played our Doors tapes
And it was dark, so dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
Remember Charlie, remember Baker
They left their childhood on every acre
And who was wrong? And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight
We held the day in the palm of our hands
They ruled the night, and the night
Seemed to last as long as six weeks
On Parris Island
We held the coastline, they held the highlands
And they were sharp, as sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together"

Go on and cry in your coffee

You had to have a white hot spotlight

And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success

And you're not sure that you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha

You had to have the front page, bold type

If you know when to leave it alone

Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me

I saw the Empire State lay low
And life went on beyond Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs and left there long ago

They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the Island bridges blow
They turned our power down and drove us underground
But we went right on with the show

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didn't notice it
We'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street

They burned the churches up in Harlem
Like in that Spanish Civil War
The flames were everywhere, but no one really cared
It always burned up there before

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I watched the mighty skyline fall
The boats were waiting at the Battery
The union went on strike
They never sailed at all

They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
They blew the Bronx away
And sank Manhattan out at sea

You know those lights were bright on Broadway
But that was so many years ago
Before we all lived here in Florida
Before the mafia took over Mexico

There are not many who remember
They say a handful still survive
To tell the world about the way the lights went out
And keep the memory alive"

And deep inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Goodnight, my angel

And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye

Rock,Billy Joel,1976,Turnstiles,"Summer, Highland Falls","They say that these are not the best of times
But they're the only times I've ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
It's either sadness or euphoria
So we'll argue and we'll compromise
And realize that nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason coexists with our insanity
And though we choose between reality and madness
It's either sadness or euphoria
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we don't fulfill each others fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our respective similarities;
It's either sadness or euphoria"
Rock,Billy Joel,1986,The Bridge,A Matter of Trust,"One, Two, One, Two, Three, Four...

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will, it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that won't happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of trust
I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
I can't offer you proof
But you're gonna face a moment of truth
It's hard when you're always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
It's a matter of trust
You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for God's sake don't shut me out
This time you've got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it, whatever you choose
I won't hold back anything
And I'll walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
It's make believe until it's only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust
I'm sure you're aware love
We've both had our share of
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong
Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After you've heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But that can't happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of trust
It's a matter of trust
It's always been a matter of trust
It's a matter of trust"

And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Listen boy I'm sure that you think
You got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now
And you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Listen boy it's not automatically
A certain guarantee
To insure yourself you've got to provide
Communication constantly
When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

Listen boy it's good information
From a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now that you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it"

So, I wait in the dark, listening for her
Instead of hearing my old man saying ""Stop
Kidding yourself, wasting your time!""

There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for Leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for Leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to Leyna

All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna

Rock,Billy Joel,1976,Turnstiles,Prelude / Angry Young Man,"There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
He's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
Give a moment or two to the angry young man
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight
I once believed in causes too
I had my pointless point of view
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right
And there's always a place for the angry young man
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand
And he's never been able to learn from mistakes
So he can't understand why his heart always breaks
And his honor is pure and his courage as well
And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell
And he'll go to the grave as an angry old man

Yes there's always a place for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
He's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man"

Be better baby, but believe me, it's the next best thing

Until you're pointing it and stunning their senses

You'll shoot 'em down because you're waiting for somebody good to come on

But you'll be sleeping with the television on, hey
Oh, you say you're looking for someone solid here
You can't be bothered with those ""just for the night"" boys
Tonight unless you take some kind of chances dear
Tomorrow morning you'll wake up with the white noise
All night long, all night long
You're only standing there 'cause somebody once did somebody wrong
(All night long, all night long)
But you'll be sleeping with the television on
Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me
But your attitude is ""don't waste my time""
Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me
But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be the same old line
This isn't easy for me to say, Diane
I know you don't need anybody's protection
I really wish I was less of a thinking man
And more a fool who's not afraid of rejection
All night long, all night long
I'll just be standing here 'cause I know I don't have the guts to come on
(All night long, all night long)
And I'll be sleeping with the television on
Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me

Rock,Billy Joel,1993,River of Dreams,2000 Years,"In the beginning
There was the cold and the night
Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light
Man was triumphant
Armed with the faith and the will
That even the darkest ages couldn't kill
Too many kingdoms
Too many flags on the field
So many battles, so many wounds to be healed
Time is relentless
Only true love perseveres
It's been a long time and now I'm with you
After two thousand years

This is our moment
Here at the crossroads of time
We hope our children carry our dreams down the line
They are the vintage
What kind of life will they live?
Is this a curse or a blessing that we give?
Sometimes I wonder
Why are we so blind to fate?
Without compassion, there can be no end to hate
No end to sorrow
Caused by the same endless fears
Why can't we learn from all we've been through
After two thousand years?

There will be miracles
After the last war is won
Science and poetry ruling the new world to come
Prophets and angels
Gave us the power to see
What an amazing future there will be
And in the evening
After the fire and the light
One thing is certain: Nothing can hold back the night
Time is relentless
And as the past disappears
We're on the verge of all things new
We are two thousand years"

Start the car, and I try to make the midnight show

Get up!

Get down!

Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow

It goes

Rock,Jethro Tull,1972,Live at Madison Square Garden 1978,Thick as a Brick,"Really don't mind if you sit this one out
My word's but a whisper, your deafness a shout
I may make you feel but I can't make you think
Your sperm's in the gutter, your love's in the sink
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels

To be thick as a brick

And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction, the moral melee
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way
But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels

To be thick as a brick

And the love that I feel
Is so far away
I'm a bad dream
That I just had today
And you shake your head
And say it's a shame

Spin me back down the years
And the days of my youth
Draw the lace and black curtains
And shut out the whole truth
Spin me down the long ages
Let them sing the song

See there! A son is born
And we pronounce him fit to fight
There are black-heads on his shoulders
And he pees himself in the night
We'll make a man of him
Put him to a trade
Teach him to play Monopoly
And how to sing in the rain




The Poet and the Painter
Casting shadows on the water
As the sun plays on the infantry
Returning from the sea
The do-er and the thinker
No allowance for the other
As the failing light illuminates
The mercenary's creed
The home fire burning
The kettle almost boiling
But the master of the house
Is far away
The horses stamping
Their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning
Of the day
And the poet lifts his pen
While the soldier sheaths his sword

And the youngest of the family
Is moving with authority
Building castles by the sea
He dares the tardy tide
To wash them all aside, oh


The cattle quietly grazing
At the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water
Moves onward to the sea
The builder of the castles
Renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl
Whose offer is his need
The young men of the household
Have all gone into service
And are not to be expected
For a year
The innocent young master
Thoughts moving ever faster
Has formed the plan
To change the man he seems
And the poet sheaths his pen
While the soldier lifts his sword

And the oldest of the family
Is moving with authority
Coming from across the sea
He challenges the son
Who puts him to the run


What do you do when the old man's gone
Do you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song
Do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam
And the whirlpool turns you way off-beam


I've come down from the upper class
To mend your rotten ways
My father was a man-of-power
Whom everyone obeyed

So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man
Twenty years too late


Your bread and water's going cold
Your hair is too short and neat
I'll judge you all and make damn sure
That no-one judges me


You curl your toes in fun
As you smile at everyone
You meet the stares, you're unaware
That your doings aren't done
And you laugh most ruthlessly
As you tell us what not to be
But how are we supposed to see
Where we should run?

I see you shuffle in the courtroom with
Your rings upon your fingers
And your downy little sidies
And your silver-buckle shoes
Playing at the hard case
You follow the example
Of the comic-paper idol
Who lets you bend the rules

So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way
Well! Make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day

You put your bet on number one
And it comes up every time
The other kids have all backed down
And they put you first in line
And so you finally ask yourself
Just how big you are
And you take your place in a wiser world
Of bigger motor cars
And you wonder who to call on

So! Where the hell was Biggles
When you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen
Who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall
Writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition
Of the Boy Scout Manual




See there! A man is born
And we pronounce him fit for peace
There's a load lifted from his shoulders
With the discovery of his disease
We'll take a child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it to be a wise man
And how to fool the rest


We will be geared to the average, rather than the exceptional
God is an overwhelming responsibility
We walked through the maternity ward
And saw 218 babies wearing nylons
It says here that cats are on the upgrade
Upgrade? Hipgrave
Oh, Mac

In the clear white circles of morning wonder
I take my place with the lord of the hills
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured
In neat little rows sporting canvas frills
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention
While queuing for sarnies at the office canteen
Saying: ""How's your granny?"" and good old Ernie
He coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win


The legends worded in the ancient tribal hymn
Lie cradled in the seagull's call
And all the promises they made
Are ground beneath the sadist's fall

The poet and the wise man stand
Behind the gun, behind the gun
And signal for the crack of dawn
Light the sun, light the sun

Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

The Dawn Creation of the Kings
Has begun, has begun
Soft Venus, lonely maiden brings
The ageless one, the ageless one

Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

The fading hero has returned
To the night, to the night
And fully pregnant with the day
Wise men endorse the poet's sight

Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?



Let me tell you the tales of your life
Of your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression, the wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed
Well, let me sing of the losers who lie
In the street as the last bus goes by
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red
While the fool toasts his god in the sky

So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear

Let me help you pick up your dead
As the sins of the father are fed
With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise and
From the pan under your bed
Well, let me make you a present of song
As the wise man breaks wind and is gone
While the fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose
And the nursery rhyme winds along

So! Come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear
See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour
Or the wiser man who rushes clear


So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way
Well! Make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day

To make you feel much better than you could know
Dust you down from tip to toe
Show you how the garden grows
Hold you steady as you go
Join the chorus if you can:
It'll make of you an honest man

Let me bring you love from the field:
Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain
To heal the wound and still the pain
That threatens again and again
As you drag down every lover's lane
Life's long celebration's here
I'll toast you all in penny cheer

Let me bring you all things refined:
Galliards and lute songs served in chilling ale
Greetings well met fellow, hail!
I am the wind to fill your sail
I am the cross to take your nail:
A singer of these ageless times
With kitchen prose and gutter rhymes

Songs from the wood - make you feel much better 
Songs from the wood 

Let me bring you love from the field:
Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain
To heal the wound and still the pain
That threatens again and again
As you drag down every lovers' lane
Life's long celebration's here
I'll toast you all in penny cheer

Songs from the wood - make you feel much better
Songs from the wood - make you feel much better"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1971,Aqualung,Wind-Up,"When I was young and they packed me off to school
And taught me how not to play the game
I didn't mind if they groomed me for success
Or if they said that I was just a fool
So I left there in the morning
With their God tucked underneath my arm
Their half-assed smiles and the book of rules
And I asked this God a question
And by way of firm reply
He said: ""I'm not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays""
So to my old headmaster and to anyone who cares
Before I'm through I'd like to say my prayers
I don't believe you
You had the whole damn thing all wrong
He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays
Well, you can excommunicate me on my way to Sunday school
And have all the bishops harmonize these lines
How do you dare to tell me that I'm my father's son
When that was just an accident of birth
I'd rather look around me, compose a better song
'Cause that's the honest measure of my worth
In your pomp and all your glory you're a poorer man than me
As you lick the boots of death born out of fear
When I was young and they packed me off to school
And taught me how not to play the game
I didn't mind if they groomed me for success

Rock,Jethro Tull,1971,Aqualung,Mother Goose,"As I did walk by Hampstead Fair
I came upon Mother Goose
So I turned her loose--
She was screaming
And a foreign student said to me
Was it really true
There are elephants, lions too
In Piccadilly Circus?
Walked down by the bathing pond
To try and catch some sun
Saw at least a hundred school girls
Sobbing into handkerchiefs as one
I don't believe they knew
I was a schoolboy
And a bearded lady said to me
If you start your raving
And your misbehaving
You'll be sorry
And the chicken fancier came to play
With his long red beard
And his sister's weird--
She drives a lorry
Laughed down by the putting green
I popped 'em in their holes
Four and twenty labourers were labouring
And digging up their gold
I don't believe they knew
That I was Long John Silver
Saw Johnny Scarecrow make his rounds
In his jet black mac
Which he won't give back--
Stole it from a snowman
As I did walk by Hampstead Fair
I came upon Mother Goose
So I turned her loose--
She was screaming
Walked down by the bathing pond
To try and catch some sun
Must have been least a hundred school girls
Sobbing into handkerchiefs as one
I don't believe they knew

Hard to find new words to say
I think about the bad old days
We used to know
Nights of winter turn me cold
Fears of dying, getting old
We ran the race, the race was won
By running slowly
Could be soon we'll cease to sound
Slowly upstairs, faster down
Then to revisit stony grounds
We used to know
With every morning shilling spent
Made no sense to leave the bed
The bad old days, they came and went
Giving way to fruitful years

Saving up the birds in hand
While in the bush the others land
Take what we can before the man
Says it's time to go
Each to his own way, I'll go mine
Best of luck with what you find
But for your own sake remember times
We used to know"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1970,Benefit,Teacher,"Well the dawn was coming
Heard him ringing on my bell
He said, My name's the teacher
That is what I call myself
And I have a lesson
That I must impart to you
It's an old expression
But I must insist it's true
Jump up, look around
Find yourself some fun
No sense in sitting there hating everyone
No man's an island and his castle isn't home
The nest is full of nothing when the bird has flown
So I took a journey
Threw my world into the sea
With me went the teacher
Who found fun instead of me
Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
What I was looking for, got something on my mind
Then the teacher told me
It had been a lot of fun
Thanked me for his ticket
And all that I had done

Rock,Jethro Tull,1976,Too Old to Rock ‘n’ Roll: Too Young to Die!,Too Old to Rock ‘n’ Roll: Too Young to Die,"The old Rocker wore his hair too long
Wore his trouser cuffs too tight
Unfashionable to the end --- drank his ale too light
Death's head belt buckle --- yesterday's dreams ---
The transport caf' prophet of doom
Ringing no change in his double-sewn seams
In his post-war-babe gloom
Now he's too old to Rock'n'Roll but he's too young to die
He once owned a Harley Davidson and a Triumph Bonneville
Counted his friends in burned-out spark plugs
And prays that he always will
But he's the last of the blue blood greaser boys
All of his mates are doing time:
Married with three kids up by the ring road
Sold their souls straight down the line
And some of them own little sports cars
And meet at the tennis club do's
For drinks on a Sunday --- work on Monday
They've thrown away their blue suede shoes
Now they're too old to Rock'n'Roll and they're too young to die
So the old Rocker gets out his bike
To make a ton before he takes his leave
Up on the A1 by Scotch Corner
Just like it used to be
And as he flies --- tears in his eyes ---
His wind-whipped words echo the final take
And he hits the trunk road doing around 120
With no room left to brake
And he was too old to Rock'n'Roll but he was too young to die
No, you're never too old to Rock'n'Roll if you're too young to die
But he was too young to die"

Paddle right out of the mess
And you paddle right out of the mess"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1974,War Child,Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day,"Meanwhile back in the year one
When you belonged to no one
You didn't stand a chance, son
If your pants were undone
'Cause you were bred, for humanity
And sold to society
One day you'll wake up, in the present day
A million generations removed from expectations
Of being who you really want to be
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
So as you push off from the shore
Won't you turn your head once more
And make your peace with everyone
For those who choose to stay
Will live just one more day
To do the things they should've done
And as you cross the wilderness
Spinning in your emptiness
If you have to, pray
Looking for a sign, that the universal mind
Has written you into the passion play
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
And as you cross the circle line
Well, the ice wall creaks behind
You're a rabbit on the run
And the silver splinters fly
In the corner of your eye
Shining in the setting sun
Well, do you ever get the feeling
That the story's too damn real
And in the present tense?
Or that everybody's on the stage
And it seems like you're the only
Person sitting in the audience?
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
Skating away, skating away, skating away"

Rock,Jethro Tull,1975,Minstrel in the Gallery,Baker Street Muse,"('Baker Street Muse', take one)
(Shit shit shit, take two)
Windy bus-stop. Click. Shop-window. Heel
Shady gentleman. Fly-button. Feel
In the underpass, the blind man stands
With cold flute hands
Symphony match-seller, breath out of time -
You can call me on another line
Indian restaurants that curry my brain
Newspaper warriors changing the names
They advertise from the station stand
With cold print hands
Symphony word-player, I'll be your headline
If you catch me another time
Didn't make her - with my Baker Street ruse
Couldn't shake her - with my Baker Street bruise
Like to take her - I'm just a Baker Street muse
Ale-spew, puddle-brew - boys, throw it up clean
Coke and Bacardi colours them green
From the typing pool goes the mini-skirted princess
With great finesse
Fertile earth-mother, your burial mound
Is fifty feet down in the Baker Street underground
(Oh, what the hell?)
I didn't make her - with my Baker Street ruse
Couldn't shake her - with my Baker Street bruise
Like to take her - I'm just a Baker Street muse
Walking down the gutter thinking, ""How the hell am I today?""
Well, I didn't really ask you but thanks all the same

""Big bottled Fraulein, put your weight on me,""
Said the pig-me to the whore
Desperate for more
In his assault upon the mountain
Little man, his youth a fountain
Overdrafted and still counting
Vernacular, verbose
An attempt at getting close
To where he came from
In the doorway of the stars
Between Blandford Street and Mars;
Proposition, deal. Flying button feel
Testicle testing, wallet ever-bulging
Dressed to the left, divulging
The wrinkles of his years
Wedding-bell induced fears
Shedding bell-end tears
In the pocket of her resistance
International assistance
Flowing generous and full
To his never-ready tool
Pulls his eyes over her wool
And he shudders as he comes -
And my rudder slowly turns me into the Marylebone Road


And here slip I, dragging one foot in the gutter
In the midnight echo of
The shop that sells cheap radios
And there sits she —
No bed, no bread, no butter —
On a double yellow line
Where she can park anytime
Old Lady Grey; Crash-barrier Waltzer -
Some only son's mother
Baker Street casualty
Oh, Mr. Policeman - blue shirt ballet master
Feet in sticking plaster - Move the old lady on
Strange pas-de-deux - His Romeo to her Juliet
Her sleeping draught
His poisoned regret
No drunken bums allowed
To sleep here in the crowded emptiness
Oh officer, oh let me send her to a cheap hotel -
I'll pay the bill and make her well —
'Like hell you bloody will!'
No do-good over kill
We must teach them to be still more independent

I have no time for Time Magazine or Rolling Stone
I have no wish for wishing-wells or wishing bones
I have no house in the country; I have no motor-car
And if you think I'm joking, then I'm just a one-line joker in a public
Bar
And it seems there's nobody left for tennis; and I'm a one-band man
And I want no Top Twenty funeral or a hundred grand
There was a little boy stood on a burning log
Rubbing his hands with glee
He said, ""Oh Mother England did you light my smile
Or did you light this fire under me?""
One day I'll be a minstrel in the gallery
And paint you a picture of the queen
And if sometimes I sing to a cynical degree
It's just the nonsense that it seems
So I drift down through the Baker Street valley
In my steep-sided un-reality
And when all's said and all's done
Couldn't wish for a better one —
It's a real-life ripe dead-certainty
That I'm just a Baker Street muse
Talking to the gutter-stinking, winking in the same old way
I tried to catch my eye but I looked the other way
Indian restaurants that curry my brain
Newspaper warriors changing the names
They advertise from the station stand
Circumcised with cold print hands
Windy bus-stop. Click. Shop-window. Heel
Shady gentleman. Fly-button. Feel
In the underpass, the blind man stands
With cold flute hands

Didn't make her - with my Baker Street ruse
Couldn't shake her - with my Baker Street bruise

Chasing shadows slipping
In the magic lantern slide
Creatures of the candle
On a night-light ride
Dipping and weaving, flutter
Through the golden needle's eye
In our haystack madness
Butterfly-stroking on a Spring-tide high

And we'll all burn together as the wick grows higher

Rock,Jethro Tull,1973,A Passion Play ,"A Passion Play, Part 2","This is the story of the hare who lost his spectacles
Owl loved to rest quietly whilst no one was watching
Sitting on a fence one day, he was surprised when suddenly a Kangaroo ran close by
Now this may not seem strange, but when Owl overheard Kangaroo whisper to no one in particular
""The Hare has lost his spectacles,"" well, he began to wonder
Presently, the moon appeared from behind a cloud and there, lying on the grass, was Hare
In the stream that flowed by the grass, a Newt
And sitting astride a twig of a bush, a Bee
Ostensibly motionless, the Hare was trembling with excitement
For without his spectacles he appeared completely helpless
Where were his spectacles? Could someone have stolen them?
Had he mislaid them? What was he to do?
Bee wanted to help, and thinking he had the answer began:
""You probably ate them thinking they were a carrot.""
""No!"" interrupted Owl, who was wise
""I have good eye-sight, insight, and foresight
How could an intelligent hare make such a silly mistake?""
But all the time, Owl had been sitting on the fence, scowling!
Kangaroo were hopping mad at this sort of talk
She thought herself far superior in intelligence to the others
She was their leader, their guru. She had the answer:
""Hare, you must go in search of the optician.""
But then she realized that Hare was completely helpless without his spectacles
And so, Kangaroo loudly proclaimed, ""I can't send Hare in search of anything!""
""You can guru, you can!"" shouted Newt
""You can send him with Owl.""
But Owl had gone to sleep
Newt knew too much to be stopped by so small a problem
""You can take him in your pouch.""
But alas, Hare was much too big to fit into Kangaroo's pouch
All this time, it had been quite plain to hare that the others knew nothing about spectacles
As for all their tempting ideas, well Hare didn't care
The lost spectacles were his own affair
And after all, Hare did have a spare pair
A-pair


We sleep by the ever-bright hole in the door
Eat in the corner, talk to the floor
Cheating the spiders who come to say ""Please"", (politely)
They bend at the knees
Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs
Old gentlemen talk of when they were young
Of ladies lost, of erring sons
Lace-covered dandies revel (with friends)
Pure as the truth, tied at both ends
Well I'll go to the foot of our stairs
Scented cathedral spire pointed down
We pray for souls in Kentish Town
A delicate hush
The gods, floating by
Wishing us well
Pie in the sky
God of Ages, Lord of Time
Mine is the right, right to be wrong
Well I'll go to the foot of our stairs
Jack rabbit mister spawn a new breed of love-hungry pilgrims (no bodies to feed)
Show me a good man and I'll show you the door
The last hymn is sung and the devil cries ""More.""
Well, I'm all for leaving and that being done
I've put in a request to take up my turn
In that forsaken paradise that calls itself ""Hell""
Where no-one has nothing and nothing is- well -meaning fool
Pick up thy bed and rise up from your gloom smiling
Give me your hate and do as the loving heathen do

Colours I've none dark or light, red, white or blue
Cold is my touch (freezing)
Summoned by name - I am the overseer over you
Given this command to watch o'er our miserable sphere
Fallen from grace, called on to bring sun or rain
Occasional corn from my oversight grew
Fell with mine angels from a far better place
Offering services for the saving of face
Now you're here, you may as well admire
All whom living has retired from the benign reconciliation
Legends were born surrounding mysterious lights
Seen in the sky (flashing)

I'm only breathing
There's life on my ceiling
The flies there are sleeping quietly
Twist my right arm in the dark. I would give two or three for
One of those days that never made impressions on the old score
I would gladly be a dog barking up the wrong tree
Everyone's saved we're in the grave
See you there for afternoon tea
Time for awaking the tea lady's making
A brew-up and baking new bread
Pick me up at half past none
There's not a moment to lose
There is the train on which I came
On the platform are my old shoes
Station master rings his bell
Whistles blow and flags wave
A little of what you fancy does you good (Or so it should)
I thank everybody for making me welcome
I'd stay but my wings have just dropped off


Hail! Son of kings make the ever-dying sign
Cross your fingers in the sky
For those about to BE
There am I waiting along the sand
Cast your sweet spell upon the land and sea
Magus Perdé, take your hand from off the chain
Loose a wish to still, the rain, the storm about to BE
Here am I (voyager into life)
Tough are the soles that tread the knife's edge
Break the circle, stretch the line, call upon the devil
Bring the gods, the gods' own fire
In the conflict revel
The passengers upon the ferry crossing, waiting to be born
Renew the pledge of life's long song rise to the reveille horn
Animals queuing at the gate that stands upon the shore
Breathe the ever-burning fire that guards the ever-door
Man - son of man - buy the flame of ever-life
(Yours to breathe and breath the pain of living): living BE!

With his long tail hanging down
He sits quietly under every tree ---
In the folds of his velvet gown
He drinks from the empty acorn cup
The dew that dawn sweetly bestows
And taps his cane upon the ground ---
Signals the snowdrops it's time to grow

It's no fun being Jack-In-The-Green ---
No place to dance, no time for song
He wears the colours of the summer soldier ---
Carries the green flag all the winter long

Jack, do you never sleep ---
Does the green still run deep in your heart?
Or will these changing times
Motorways, powerlines
Keep us apart?
Well, I don't think so ---
I saw some grass growing through the pavements today

The rowan, the oak and the holly tree
Are the charges left for you to groom
Each blade of grass whispers Jack-In-The-Green
Oh Jack, please help me through my winter's night
And we are the berries on the holly tree
Oh, the mistlethrush is coming
Jack, put out the light"

See all the things we haven't done --
Oh was it better then to run
Than to spend the summer crying
Now summer cannot come anyway
I had waited for time to change her
The only change that came was over me
She pretended not to want love --
I hope she was only fooling me
So when you look into the sun
Look for the pleasures nearly won
Or was it better then to run
Than to spend the summer singing
And summer could have come in a day
So if you hear my sad song singing
Remember who and what you nearly had
It's not easy singing sad songs
When you can sing the song to make me glad
So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung:
It's not too late, only begun
We can still make summer
Yes, summer always comes anyway
So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung:
It's not too late, only begun
Look into the sun"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1977,Songs from the Wood,Cup of Wonder,"May I make my fond excuses
For the lateness of the hour
But we accept your invitation, and we bring you Beltane's flower
For the May Day is the great day, sung along the old straight track
And those who ancient lines did lay
Will heed the song that calls them back

Pass the word and pass the lady, pass the plate to all who hunger
Pass the wit of ancient wisdom, pass the cup of crimson wonder

Ask the Green Man where he comes from, ask the cup that fills with red
Ask the old grey standing stones that show the sun it's way to bed
Question all as to their ways
And learn the secrets that they hold
Walk the lines of nature's palm
Crossed with silver and with gold


Join in black December's sadness
Lie in August's welcome corn
Stir the cup that's ever-filling
With the blood of all that's born
But the May Day is the great day, sung along the old straight track
And those who ancient lines did lay
Will heed this song that calls them back"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1977,Songs from the Wood,Fire at Midnight,"I believe in fires at midnight
When the dogs have all been fed
A golden toddy on the mantle
A broken gun beneath the bed
Silken mist outside the window
Frogs and newts slip in the dark
Too much hurry ruins a body
I'll sit easy, fan the spark

Kindled by the dying embers
Of another working day
Go upstairs, take off your makeup
Fold your clothes neatly away
Me, I'll sit and write this love song
As I all too seldom do
Build a little fire this midnight
It's good to be back home with you


Kindled by the dying embers
Of another working day
Go upstairs, take off your makeup
Fold your clothes neatly away
Me, I'll sit and write this love song
As I all too seldom do
Build a little fire this midnight
It's good to be back home with you"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1970,Living in the Past,Witch’s Promise,"Lend me your ear while I call you a fool
You were kissed by a witch one night in the wood
And later insisted your feelings were true
The witches promise was coming
Believing he listened while laughing you flew
Leaves falling, red, yellow, brown, all look the same
And the love you had found lay outside in the rain
Washed clean by the water but nursing its pain
The witches promise was coming
And you're looking elsewhere for your own selfish gain
Keep looking, keep looking for somewhere to be
Well, you're wasting your time, they're not stupid like he is
Meanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see
You won't find it easy now, it's only fair
He was willing to give to you, you didn't care
You're waiting for more but you've already had your share
The witches promise is turning
So don't you wait up for him, he's going to be late"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1979,Stormwatch,Dun Ringill,"Clear light on a slick palm
As I mis-deal the day
Slip the night from a shaved pack
Make a marked card play
Call twilight hours down
From a heaven home
High above the highest bidder
For the good Lord's throne
In the wee hours I'll meet you
Down by Dun Ringill ---
Oh, and we'll watch the old gods play
By Dun Ringill
We'll wait in stone circles
'til the force comes through ---
Lines joint in faint discord
And the stormwatch brews
A concert of kings
As the white sea snaps
At the heels of a soft prayer
Whispered
In the wee hours I'll meet you
Down by Dun Ringill ---
Oh, and I'll take you quickly
By Dun Ringill"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1978,Heavy Horses,...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps,"Muscled, black with steel-green eye
Swishing through the rye grass
With thoughts of mouse-and-apple pie
Tail balancing at half-mast
...And the mouse police never sleeps ---
Lying in the cherry tree
Savage bed foot-warmer of purest feline ancestry
Look out, little furry folk!
He's the all-night working cat
Eats but one in every ten ---
Leaves the others on the mat
...And the mouse police never sleeps ---
Waiting by the cellar door
Window-box town crier;
Birth and death registrar
With claws that rake a furrow red ---
Licensed to mutilate
From warm milk on a lazy day
To dawn patrol on hungry hate
...No, the mouse police never sleeps ---
Climbing on the ivy
Windy roof-top weathercock
Warm-blooded night on a cold tile"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1975,Minstrel in the Gallery,Cold Wind to Valhalla,"(This one's called 'Cold Wind to Valhalla')
And ride with us young bonny lass
With the angels of the night
Crack wind clatter, flesh-rein bite
On an outsize unicorn
Roughshod winging sky-blue flight
On a cold wind to Valhalla
And join with us please — Valkyrie maidens cry
Above the cold wind to Valhalla
Breakfast with the gods — Night angels serve
With ice-bound majesty
Frozen flaking fish raw nerve
In a cup of silver liquid fire
Moon jet brave beam split ceiling swerve
And light the old Valhalla
Come join with us please — Valkyrie maidens cry
Above the cold wind to Valhalla
The heroes rest upon the sighs
Of Thor's trusty handmaidens
Midnight lonely whisper cries
We're getting a bit short on heroes lately
Sword snap fright white pale goodbyes
In the desolation of Valhalla
And join with us please — Valkyrie maidens ride
Empty-handed on the cold wind to Valhalla"
Rock,Jethro Tull,1978,Heavy Horses,No Lullaby,"Keep your eyes open and prick up your ears
Rehearse your loudest cry
There's folk out there who would do you harm
So I'll sing you no lullaby
There's a lock on the window, there's a chain on the door
And a big dog in the hall
But there's dragons and beasties out there in the night
To snatch you if you fall
So come out fighting with your rattle in hand, thrust and parry; light
A match to catch the devil's eye, bring a cross of fire to the fight
And let no sleep bring false relief from the tension of the fray
Come wake the dead with the scream of life, do battle with ghosts at play
And gather your toys at the call-to-arms and swing your big bear down
Upon our necks when we come to set you sleeping safe and sound
It's as well we tell no lie to chase the face that cries
And little birds can't fly so keep an open eye
It's as well we tell no lie, so I'll sing you no lullaby
It's as well we tell no lie to chase the face that cries
And little birds can't fly so keep an open eye
It's as well we tell no lie, so I'll sing you no lullaby

Rock,Santana,2002,Shaman,Why Don’t You & I,"Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""

When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

Every time I try to talk to you

Turns out everything I say to you

So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""

Slowly, I begin to realize, this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by
And I say, ""Oh, here we go again, oh""

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together

And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs I'm digging the lows
Cuz at least I feel alive
I never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good I'm feeling you

The ones at the club that be makin' the fires start
Your fools with the thugs that be makin' the guns spark
Why can't we all just get along?

Streets on fire, the people fleeting
Someone said there's O. J. speeding
Cochran beef in that club ain't fittin'

Still boppin' heads on the uptown train
Playin' in the speakers while you drive in the rain
Speeding on the parkway switchin' lanes
From the underground to the tunnel bangin' your radio

The Santana show via satellite in Mexico
VIP at the door
No more dreamin', guitars screamin'
You can make it, keep believing
But as times keep passin'
Feel my passion
I won't sell my soul for fashion
Grammy night, too much hype
Too much cars, too much ice
My man just got 25 to life
Aaliayh flies to paradise

The way things are this minute

If memory can hold within it what I'm feeling
Should time try fading or stealing something away
Hold on, nothing's the same
Tell me why I feel this way
Life wouldn't be worth living without you
All along I've been the pretender
But now that's gone forever
Nobody's ever loved me like you do
Nobody's broken through
Got to concentrate, file away

Don't want to lose what's going down
I want to remember everything I'm feeling

Muy lejos de la tierra
Así olvidando como duele la tristeza

En ti me quedaré
Cuando amas nunca es tarde
Das el alma hasta entregarte
Y esa llama que quema la sangre
Te invita a soñar
Una noche en Nápoles
Con la luna en los mares
Tu cariño me conquistó
Y nos saltamos a volar
Una noche en Nápoles
Bajo el vilo del amor
El aire de tus alas
Al cielo me llevo

Ahora mi corazón lastimado
Desde el cielo brillante fue alejado
Me quedo sin fe y sin esperanza
Pa' gue bastante por darte mi confianza

Cuantas horas y cuantos días
En ti te lloraré
Cuando amas nunca es tarde
Das el alma hasta entregarte

Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes

As a foundation left to create the spiral aim

Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed
Between the picture of time behind the face of need

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you, oh

Coins and crosses never know their fruitless worth
Cords are broken, locked inside the mother earth
They won't hide, oh, they won't tell you
Watching the world, watching all of the world
Watching us go by

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley
And you and I reached out for reasons to call



Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
As a movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you



Sad preacher nailed upon the colored door of time
Insane teacher be there, reminded of the rhyme
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
Political ends, as sad remains, will die
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you
Ooh, ooh

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid

Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you


And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning
And you and I reach, over the sun for the river
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas"

Reminded of an inner pact between us, that's seen as we go
And ride there, in motion
To fields in debts of honour, defending
Stand the marchers soaring talons
Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom, fighting we know
Destroy oppression, the point to reaction
As leaders look to you, attacking
Choose and renounce, throwing chains to the floor
Kill or be killing, faster sins correct the flow
Casting giant shadows off fast penetrating force
To alter via the war that's seen, as friction spans the spirits wrath ascending to redeem
Wars that shout in screams of anguish
Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver, surely we know
In glory we rise to offer
Create our freedom, a word we utter
A word
Words cause our banner, victorious our day
Will silence be promised as violence displays
The curse increased, we fight the power and live by it by day
Our gods awake in thunderous roars and guide the Leader's hand in paths of glory to the cause
Listen, should we fight forever
Knowing as we do know, fear destroys
Listen, should we leave our children
Listen, our lives stare in silence
Help us now
Listen, your friends have been broken
They tell us of your poison, now we know
Kill them, give them as they give us
Slay them, burn their children's laughter
On to hell
The fist will run, grasp metal to gun
The spirit sings in crashing tones, we gain the battle drum
Our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn
The pen won't stay the demon's wings
The hour approaches, pounding out the Devil's sermon
Soon, oh soon the light
Pass within and soothe this endless night
And wait here for you
Our reason to be here
Soon, oh soon the time
All we move to gain will reach and calm
Our heart is open
Our reason to be here
Long ago, set into rhyme

Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day
And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then
Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then
Thoughts will be thought together, soon in our minds forever then
Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then
Truth is just for the being and there's the sight for seeing then
Thoughts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then
As long as we see there's only us, who can change it

Rock,Yes,1971,The Yes Album,A Venture,"Once a peaceful man laid his old head down by a river
Thought about his childhood life, his father and forgiver
Who couldn't hide away, hide away
He controlled the horses with a handclap or a whisper
Drink he couldn't combat but in all he was no sinner
Couldn't hide away, hide away
He told all his sons of all the antics of a venture
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink
Not to hide away, hide away
Better men have realised alone is not a venture
A peaceful man would realise alone is no adventure
Just to hide away, hide away
He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink
Not to hide away, hide away"

Once bitten, twice shy
No - No regrets at all
Justice - Body smooth take over
Good girls they work the city
Good guys they spike you hard
How they jive and jingle
When you're in their backyard
Street corner wonder lust
Beckoning the good guy
Take this, get that
Have a good time
He young and tactile
He ready for anything that is
How they jive and jingle
They've read the book that gives
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
Supervise this good treatment
Alternative line by line
So the street guys so observant
Take him for a ride
Have a good time
Like a legend the man he's sharp
His woman gladly watching
As he strides out of the dark
Better be quick, get away
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
Good timing has its good price
One trick and you're stuck with the dice
How they jive and jingle
When you're their sacrifice
Fast as lightning
Go - Go get high - He's looking good
Once bitten, twice shy
No woman no cry
No woman don't cry
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come
We'll be waiting for the night

Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way

Here's your ticket, pack your bag, it's time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire, ah!

All wet, here, you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say, “Baby, what did you expect?”
Gonna burst into flame, ah!

Burning down the house

My house is out of the ordinary
That’s right, don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet

Everything's stuck together

I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey

To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
Ain't got no records to play

Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard
I ain't got no time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines
I know that that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now
I don't know what I look like
You make me shiver and I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team

Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive"

Lifting my head, looking around inside

The island of doubt, it's like a taste of medicine
Working by hindsight, got the message from the oxygen
M-m-making a list, find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right, facts are useful in emergencies

The feeling returns, whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head, looking around inside

Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts aren't lazy and facts aren't lame
Facts don't come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of men

Who took the money away?
I, I, I, I, it's always showtime

What was the place, what was the name?
We wanna wait, but here we go again

I, takes over slowly
But doesn't last very long
I, I, I, I, no need to worry
Everything's under control
O-U-T, but no hard feelings
What do you know? Take you away
We're being taken for a ride again

I got a girlfriend that's better than that
She has the smoke in her eyes
She's coming up, going right through my heart
She's gonna give me surprise
I think it's right, better than this
I think you can if you like
I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair
And nothing is better than that (is it?)

Down, down in the basement
We hear the sound of machines
I, I, I'm driving in circles
Come to my senses sometimes
Why, why, why, why start it over?
Nothing was lost, everything's free
I don't care how impossible it seems

Somebody calls you but you cannot hear
Get closer to be far away
And only one look and that's all that it takes
Maybe that's all that we need
All that it takes, I'll bet it's right
All it takes, if it's right
I got a girlfriend that's better than that
And she goes wherever she likes (there she goes)

I got a girlfriend that's better than that
Now everyone's getting involved
She's moving up going right through my heart
We might not ever get caught
Going right through, try to stay cool
Going through, staying cool
I got a girlfriend, she's better than that
And nothing is better than you (wait a minute)

I got a girlfriend that's better than this
But you don't remember at all
As we get older and stop making sense
You won't find her waiting long
Stop making sense, stop making sense
Stop making sense, making sense
I got a girlfriend, she's better than that

We've heard this little scene, we've heard it many times
People fighting over little things and wasting precious time
They might be better off, I think, the way it seems to me
Making up their own shows, which might be better than TV

Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations
Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations
They've enlisted all their family
They've enlisted all their friends
It helped save their relationship
And made it work again

Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit
There might even be a spin-off, but they're not sure 'bout that
If they ever watch TV again, it'd be too soon for them
Bob never yells about the picture now, he's having too much fun

Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations

If your work isn't what you love, then something isn't right
Just think of Bob and Judy, they're happy as can be
Inventing situations, putting them on TV

I think of things that I might be
I see my name go down in history

I was complaining, I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up!

Dark and savage with a profile so sharp
Keep that wonderful food on the table
There's really no hurry, I'll eat in a while

No you don't remember anything at all
I'm sleeping, I'm flat on my back
Never woke up, had no regrets

There's a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
There's a party up there all the time
And they'll party till they drop

Other people can go home
Everybody else can split
I'll be here all the time
I can never quit

Take a walk through the land of shadows
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Don't look so disappointed
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?

There's a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
I'm stuck here in this seat
I might not stand up

Other people can go home!
Other people, they will split!

Everyone has gone to sleep

Let's not be ourselves today
Is it my imagination?
Is it just someone's face?
Pleasantly out of proportion
It's hard to hold on to the ground
Now I didn't come to run, and this is everything
And gravity lets you down
And I get wild, wising up
I just can't let go
I get wild when I get ready
And I can hardly talk
Living lights, special lights
Yellow turns to blue
And I get wild, it's automatic
And I can hardly move
Go ahead and pull the curtains
Check to see if I'm still here
Let me lose my perspective
For something worth waiting for
Somewhere in South Carolina
And gravity don't mean a thing
And all around the world, each and everyone
Playing with a heart of steel
I get up, climbing out
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Beautiful, beautiful
Climbing up the wall
And I get by on automatic
No surprise at all
No one here can recognize you
Here is everything that you like
Feelings without explanations
Some things are hard to describe
The sound of a cigarette burning
A place there where everything spins
And the sound inside your mind is playing all the time
You're playing with a heart of steel
And I get wild, wising up
I just can't let go
I get wild when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Red and white, black to gold
Yellow turns to blue
And I get wild, it's automatic
And I can hardly move

If lovers discover
That everyone dies

It's a dangerous life

Daddy, dear, let's get outta here
I'm scared
Ten o'clock, nighttime in New York
It's weird
If you're looking for trouble
Well, that's what you will find

Mom and Pop, they will fuck you up
For sure
Love so deep, kills you in your sleep
It's true

Love keeps us together
And love will keep us alive
And we are criminals that never broke no laws
And all we needed was a net to break our fall

Ha, they're searching for diamonds
They're grabbing at straws
Sex and sin, sax and violins
It's hell
Wooden heads, furniture with legs
For sale

Love keeps us together
And love will drive us insane
And we are criminals that never broke no laws
And all we needed was a net to break our fall

Going home, back where I belong
To stay
The rays of light, they will turn the night
To day

Birds travel together
Birds follow the sun
And I am watching as the birds go flying home"

But there's no need to panic, it's under control
We're aerodynamic and ready to roll

Just let it go

Running all night on lake avenue
It's a piece of cake
If you know what to do
You've got to lose a few
Until the stakes get high
When the odds are right
You just blow by
And make no mistake, there's women who just wait
For the man and machine with the best time

Rev on the red line
You're on your own
Feels like a lifetime
But soon you'll know

Wasn't long ago I could've lost my wheels
Had to outrun the law, it was no big deal
I guess they had a grudge, they were hot on my tracks
I had to pay off the judge to get my license back
Now I need to pin those needles, got to feel that heat
Hear my motor screaming while I'm tearing up the street

Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah

I had to think fast, I watched her walk past
I knew I would have my way
So I swaggered up, I mean I staggered up
But I didn't have a damn thing to say
Now, two handed strategy always works well for me
So I slipped my hands around her waist
I swore it was the right move, feeling so smooth
Till she backhanded me across my face

In fact ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shedding tears

Over a brown eyed handsome man

Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her, ""Darling go out and find yourself

A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man""

She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match

To win a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

And all the politicians making crazy sounds
And everybody putting everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose?
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red rimmed and red lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool, good buy
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame
Choose again
And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game

Che che che, ka tah koh

And some kinds of love, the possibilities are endless
And for me to miss one would seem to be groundless

I heard what you said, Marguerita heard Tom
And of course you're a bore but in that you're not charmless
Cause a bore is a straight line that finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love are mistaken for vision

Put jelly on your shoulder let us do what you fear most
That from which you recoil but which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder baby, lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression let us now kiss the culprit, move it on

Rock,The Velvet Underground,1985,VU,Andy’s Chest,"If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here, they were a bit cuckoo
Well, you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark
Oh, all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains bolder after you?
If I could be anyone of the things in the world that bite
Instead of an ancient ocelot on a leash, I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string, flying in the air at night
'Cause you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy minded pink bare bear
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And all the stones are erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you
Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving on the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose
And all the curtains laced with diamonds for you
And all the Roman noblemen for you
And kingdom's Christian sailors, dear, for you
And melting ice cap mountain tops for you
And knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats, that with a kiss, turn prince for you

Swoop, swoop

""Leaving Lepidoptera – please don't touch the displays, little boy; so cute – moving to the next aisle we have arachnida: the spiders, our finest collection. This friendly little devil is the Heptophilidae, unfortunately harmless. Next to him, the nasty Lycosa Raptoria; his tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of the skin. And here, my prize, the Black Widow. Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. Her kiss is fifteen times as poisonous as that of the Rattlesnake. You see, her venom is highly neuro-toxtic, which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system - causing intense pain, profuse sweating, difficulty in breathing, loss of consciousness, violent convulsions and finally death. You know, I think what I love the most about her is her inborn need to dominate, possess. In fact, immediately after the consummation of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the specie, she kills and eats him. Oh, she is delicious, and I hope he was. Such power and dignity unhampered by sentiment. If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy; I feel that Man has ruled this world as stumbling, demented child-king long enough, and as his empire crumbles my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor."""

Glimmering nightgowns
As poisonous cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe

The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks
And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash

And I put a time-bomb

With phonied up papers
And counterfeit plans

Clean sparks driving down
Cool in the waterway
Where the baptized drown
Naked in the cold sun
Breathing life like fire
Thought I was the only one
But that was just a lie

Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July

Pale in the flare light
The scared light cracks & disappears
And leads the scorched ones here
And everywhere no one cares
The fire is spreading
And no one wants to speak about it
Down in the hole
Jesus tries to crack a smile
Beneath another shovel load

I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July

And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July (July, July)

Now I'm in control
Now I'm in the fall out
Once asleep but now I stand
And I still remember
Your sweet everything
Light a Roman candle
And hold it in your hand

Run around on the floor for you
Simple Wreckage

Rock,Grateful Dead,1974,From The Mars Hotel,Scarlet Begonias,"As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try
She had rings on her fingers and
Bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was
Into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls
In the thick of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and
Was closing the door
I had one of those flashes:
I'd been there before
Been there before
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a
Touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band

Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care cause it's alright

I will get by

I will survive

I see you've got your fists out, say your piece and get out
Guess I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABC's we all think of
To try to give a little love

I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit because it's alright
Oh, well, a touch of gray, kind of suits you anyway
That's was all I had to say but it's alright

Rock,Grateful Dead,1970,American Beauty,Box of Rain,"Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through
Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, ind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame
And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there"

Their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Woah-ho what I want to know
Where does the time go?
I live in a silver mine
And I call it ""Beggar's Tomb""
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Rock,Grateful Dead,1970,American Beauty,Sugar Magnolia,"Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, heads all empty, and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river; knew she'd have to come up soon for air
Sweet blossom come on. Under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature rolling in the rushes down by the riverside
She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double. Pays my ticket when I speed
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet. She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow. Waits backstage while I sing to you
Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm. Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter. She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine. Come on honey. Come along with me
She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need:
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight. Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around. I wander 'round
Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely
Ride our singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine"

Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone
Goin' to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
Its a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head
Going home, going home, by the riverside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

Going to plant a weeping willow
On the banks green edge it will grow
Grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul"

Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin, we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

Long distance runner, what you holdin out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

Rock,Grateful Dead,1969,Live / Dead ,St. Stephen,"Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills


Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a-crawling,Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?"

Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

Don't murder me

Please don't murder me

I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, ""Come on in""

Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the queen of spades
But the cards were all the same

Don't murder me

While the boys sing round the fire

You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nuthatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

There comes a redeemer
And he slowly too fades away
There follows a wagon behind him
That's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent
All burst into bloom and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own"

In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
It can ring like fire when you lose your way

Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

God save the child who rings that bell
It may have one good ring left, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused just listen to the music play
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

In Franklin's tower the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between

Nothing to tell now

Rock,Grateful Dead,1971,Skull and Roses,Me and My Uncle,"Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they's all around
Weed, liquor and money, they load it down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand


My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be

One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, lord he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico

I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, god rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road"

Searching for the sound

Willow sky, whoa

But you will catch it when you try
Roll you down the line, boy
Drop you for a loss
Ride you out on a cold railroad And nail you to a cross
November and more
As I wait for the score
They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door
A slow winter day, a night like forever
Sink like a stone, float like a feather
Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the sawhet owl
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the winds howl

Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of shy and sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me"

Gonna roll back down

Maybe go
Beneath the ground
See here how everything
Lead up to this day

Any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up

And I decided to make my play
I said, ""babe with my boyish charm and good looks
How can you stand it for one more day?""

Or that your mind has turned to applesauce
The dreary architecture of your soul""

Steppin' out with the Jack of Speed

But there's no way back from there to here
He's a one way rider
On the shriek express
And his new best friend is at the throttle more or less

I said ""Take it down""
When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice
They're gonna do it with a shotgun
Yes, I'm cashing in this ten-cent life
For another one

They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care

We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Hung down with the freaks and ghouls

With Vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies
Giving us the farewell runarounds

Lost my innocence to a no good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth

For June angels, so far from home
For a love lost, a faded picture

All of the years I've spent in search of myself
And I'm still in the dark
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone

Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely soldier off to war
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

Ten thousand people look my way
But they can't see the way that I feel
Nobody even cares to try
I spend my life and sell my soul on the road
And I'm still in the dark
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone

Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely sailor lost at sea
Drifting with the tide, never quite knowing why
Sometimes it makes no sense at all

(I'm alive)
Looking for love, I'm a man with emotion
(And my heart's on fire)
I'm dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean
(I'm alive)


Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely soldier off to war
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why
Sometimes it makes no sense
Sometimes it makes no sense
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

At all
Can't find the meaning of it all
Yeah
Can't find the light alone, oh"

Lead Vocals by Dennis Deyoung
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Eight, Skate, Seven on the Rotate!
If I could stand
Beside myself
Would I see me or maybe someone else
'Cause it's hard to please
Most everyone
When your spirit's got you on the run, on the run
They say do your best
But don't cause a fuss
Don't make waves be like the rest of us
But I can feel the tide is turning fast
'Cause deep inside I know that I can't last
Another day
Not another day!
'Cause I'm O. K
I finally found the person I've been searching for
I'm alright
I'm feeling good about myself and that's for sure
'Cause I believed them when they said I must do things their way
They tried to cast me in their mold
But I just had to say
That I'm O. K
I'm O. K. This way yes I'm O. K. Yes I'm ok!
I'm O. K
I finally found the person I've been searching for (everybody sing now!)
I'm alright
I'm feeling good about myself and that's for sure (whoo!)
I'm O. K
I finally found the person I've been searching for (yahoo!)
I'm alright
I'm feeling good about myself and that's for sure

Rock,Styx,1981,Paradise Theatre,Nothing Ever Goes as Planned,"What'cha gonna do when the sun goes down tonight
You'll hit the same old clubs, rap that same old trash
That's right
You've got them real silk shirts and them baggy pants
Dago shoes in the colors that match
But the girls are acting bored
And you're feeling like you're going to lose
You've got the g.q. blues

You get up every morning and you go to work each day
(you go to work, you go to work, you go to work)
Been doing the same damn job for ten long years this may
(you've got to work, you've got to work, you've got to work)
You've been working and saving for your jamaican dream
Paradise is waiting across the sea
But when your plane lands montego turns to monsoon
You've got the island blues

Cause, nothing ever goes as planned
It's a hell of a notion
Even pharaohs turn to sand
Like a drop in the ocean
You're so together and you act so civilized
But every time that things go wrong you're still surprised
You've done your duty, you've paid a fortune in dues
Still got those mother nature's blues

I strut around the stage like a little king tonight
They'll scream for every word and every note, that's right
But when the show is over and I'm all alone
Can't reach my baby on the telephone
And everywhere I look mr. loneliness is in the news
I've got the big star blues

Boy, nothing ever goes as planned
It's a hell of a notion
Even pharaohs turn to sand
Like a drop in the ocean
I'm so together and I act so civilized
But every time that things go wrong
I'm still surprised
I've done my duty and paid a fortune in dues
Still got them mother nature's blues"
Rock,Styx,1977,The Grand Illusion,Miss America,"You were the apple of the public's eye
As you cut the ribbon at the local mall
A mirage for both you and us
How can this be real?

Your home state sure must be proud
The queen of the United States
Have you lost your crown?
Well, aren't you (Miss America?)
Don't you (Miss America?)
Won't you (Miss America, our love?)
Well, are you really who we think you are?
Or does your smile seem to wear you down?
Is the girl who you once were
Screaming to jump out?
In the dream that you must live
A disease for which there is no cure
This rollercoaster ride you're on
Won't stop to let you off
Well, aren't you (Miss America?)
Don't you (Miss America?)

Well, it's true just take a look
The cover sometimes makes the book
And the judges, did they ever ask
To read between your lines?
In your cage at the human zoo
They all stop to look at you
Next year, what will you do
When you have been forgotten?
Aren't you (Miss America?)
Don't you (Miss America?)

I got the letter
But I couldn't go
So many thoughts in my head
So many places to be
So many faces that I long to see
Standing in front of me
To night the lights will take me where I long to be
Just like a thousand nights before
Somebody said to me
Why do you do this to you
Why not sit back and relax
Go to the Isalnds and forget it all
Slow down
You're moving too fast
You seem afraid it won't last
Take my advice
Go straight and settle down
Thank you for caring
But
Tonight the lights will take me where I long to be
Just like a thousand nights before
I can't explain
It gives me something
Give me the lights

Rock,Styx,1977,The Grand Illusion,Castle Walls,"Once in a dream far beyond these castle walls
Down near the bay where the moonlit water falls
I stood alone while the minstrel sang his song
So afraid I'd lost my soul
There in the fog his song kept calling me
Leading me on with its haunting melody
Deep in my heart a voice kept echoing
I knew I'd soon be wandering
Far beyond these castle walls
Where the distant harbor meets the sky
There the battle raged like hell
And every dove that lost it's will to fly
Far beyond these castle walls
Where I thought I heard Tiresias say
""Life is never what it seems
And every man must meet his destiny"""

I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up
It's a line that I wouldn't have bought
Look at me
I'm the great white hope
Can't you see
I'm up against the ropes
Don't you know
It's so hard to cope
When you feel
Like the great white hope
Look at me
I'm the great white hope
Can't you see
I'm up against the ropes
Don't you know
It's so hard to cope
When you feel
Like the great white hope
Now you've paid your money
You're sitting in your ringside seat
And I know that some of you out there
Might wanna see the champ get beat
If I had known it would be like this
I might have given it a second thought
But real life sure isn't like school
There's some lessons that just can't be taught
Look at me
I'm the great white hope
Can't you see
I'm up against the ropes
Don't you know
It's so hard to cope

I get weak, just thinking about you
It all began so easily a look from you a glance from me
Then our eyes met like thunder and lightning
You and I
Strangers lost in a moment
Eye to eye
We were caught unaware by this passion inside us
Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, so rare, and so exciting
Only hope this love we found can last
I'm not a man who acts this way but lately I can't concentrate
And I don't sleep, just dreaming about you
I try to reach you on the phone but voices there say you're not home
My heart aches, just thinking I've lost you
One more time
Seeing your face in the moonlight
One more chance
To be caught unaware of this passion inside us
Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, it's hard to keep your balance
Moving past the point of no return
If you need some time
To understand your feelings
If you need some time away
I'll be waiting for you with open arms my love
All that night
We made love in the moonlight
Eye to eye
We were so unaware of this passion inside us
Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me

Do you believe I'm still chasing rainbows
When everywhere I see

In penthouse suites they sit and stare

Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow

Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only

You, just like heaven"
Rock,The Cure,1989,Disintegration,Pictures of You,"I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe, that the pictures are all I can feel

Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you"
Rock,The Cure,1979,Boys Don’t Cry,Boys Don’t Cry,"I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I've said too much, been too unkind

I tried to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I tried to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

Boys don't cry"
Rock,The Cure,1989,Disintegration,Lullaby,"I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

‘Come into my parlor,’ said the spider to the fly
‘I have a little something here’"

Just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait
Until I sha-ha-ha-hake

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today

Go on, go on

Go on, go on
Away from here

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
Inbetween without you
Without you

Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today
Come back, come back
Why can't you see
Come back, come back
Come back to me

I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain, you said

To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in

Yeah, I like you in that like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout

And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street

So pull on your hair, pull on your pout
Cut the conversation, just open your mouth
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet

I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

So, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

And every time I try to pick it up

As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands

There's nothing else I can really do

Can't you see I try?
But swimming the same deep water as you is hard
'The shallow drowned lose less than we,' you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
And we shall be together
And we shall be together
Kiss me goodbye, bow your head, and join with me
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And softly breaks against your feet
Softly breaks the mirror sweet
So we shall be together
So we shall be together
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now, and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see, and I don't feel
But softly hold up silently
My hands, before my fading eyes
And in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you, I will kiss you

Rock,The Cure,1989,Disintegration,Last Dance,"I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Expectantly, too punctual, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now, more constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment that hangs in abasement
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

Oh, I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
Walking through walls in the heart of December
The blindness, the happiness, falling down laughing
But I really believed that this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
All this in an instant before I can kiss you
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

Your name like ice into my heart

I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
And even if we drink, I don't think we will kiss
In the way that we did when the woman was only a girl"

Your grip on me - a hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me
Infectious sense of hopelessness and prayers for rain

I breathe in dirt and nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me
Your hands on me - a touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain
I deteriorate
I live in dirt and nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me
Your hands on me - a touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain

When I came here alone

Rock,The Cure,1987,"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me",How Beautiful You Are,"You want to know why I hate you?
Well, I'll try and explain
You remember that day in Paris
When we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other
That we'd always think the same
And dreamed that dream
To be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set
And waited for the night
Outside a glittering building
Of glittering glass and burning light
And in the road before us
Stood a weary greyish man
Who held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than the air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you

The father's eyes said ""Beautiful! How beautiful you are!""
The boy's eyes said
""How beautiful! She shimmers like a star!""
The child's eyes uttered nothing
But a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us
At the way we are
At the way we are

I turned to look at you
To read my thoughts upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes
So beautiful and strange
Until you spoke
And showed me understanding is a dream
""I hate these people staring
Make them go away from me!""

The father's eyes said ""Beautiful!
How beautiful you are!""
The boy's eyes said
""How beautiful!
She glitters like a star!""
The child's eyes uttered nothing
But a quiet and utter joy
And stilled my heart with sadness
At the way we are
At the way we are
At the way we are

And this is why I hate you
And how I understand
That no-one ever knows or loves another"

Like falling angels, the world disappeared
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this?
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
The first colours, the first kiss
We writhed under a red light
Voodoo smile, Siamese twins
Girl at the window looks at me for an hour
Then everything falls apart
Broken inside me, it falls apart
The walls and the ceiling move in time
Push a blade into my hands, slowly up the stairs
And into the room, is it always like this?
Dancing in my pocket
Worms eat my skin
She glows and grows with arms outstretched
Her legs around me, in the morning I cried
Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice
I walked away and grew old
You never talk, we never smile
I scream ""you're nothing
I don't need you any more, you're nothing""
It fades and spins
Fades and spins
Sing out loud, we all die
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this?

As high as I might, I can't get that high

As licky as trips, I can't lick that far
But when you pout, the way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of a magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go

And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I say
""I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away""

And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah, as smitten as that, I can't get that small
The way you fur, the how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make believe
It makes me pull my hair all out

Ice in my eyes and eyes like ice don't move

Sudden hush across the water

The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show
The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show

The very first time I saw your face
I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin
I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon

Oh, remember
Oh, please don't change

So the fall came, thirteen years
A shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat
Another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same

So they close together
Dressed in red and yellow
Innocent forever
Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show
The further we go and older we grow
The more we know the less we show"

In bed amongst the stones
The columns are all men begging to crush me

And no flags wave me home
In the caves, all cats are grey
In the caves, the texture coats my skin
In the death cell, a single note rings on and on and on"

I'm so happy I could scream!
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you
It's perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Oh, I almost can't believe that it's for real
So pinch me quick
I really don't think it gets any better than this
Vanilla smile
And a gorgeous strawberry kiss!
Birds sing we swing
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it again?
I know we should!!!


The sun is up
I'm so fizzy I could burst!
Yeah you wet through and me headfirst
Into this is perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Ow! It feels so big it almost hurts!

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it some more
I know we should

Say it will always be like this
The two of us together
It will always be like this
Forever and ever and ever
(And ever and ever)

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would

Do it all the time?
I know that we should!!!"

Push him away

The seeping mouth
The mouth that knows
The secret you
Always you
A smile to hide the fear away
Oh, smear this man across the walls
Like strawberries and cream
Its the only, its the only way to be

Exactly the same clean room
Exactly the same clean bed
But I've stayed away too long this time
And I've got too big to fit this time"

And out comes the man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
And toe to toe, don't move too slow
Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eating bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all

Through the sewer, don't strain your brain
Paint a train, you'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop to the punk rock

Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on and now he's gone

They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Now, yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long, I hear him shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released"
Rock,The Band,1975,Northern Lights - Southern Cross,It Makes No Difference,"It makes no difference where I turn
I can't get over you and the flame still burns
It makes no difference, night or day
The shadow never seems to fade away
And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door
Now there's no love
As true as the love
That dies untold
But the clouds never hung so low before
It makes no difference how far I go
Like a scar, the hurt will always show
And it makes no difference who I meet
They're just a face in the crowd on a dead-end street
And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door
These old love letters
Well, I just can't keep
Just like the gambler says:
""Read 'em and weep""
And the dawn don't rescue me no more
Without your love, I'm nothing at all
Like an empty hall, it's a lonely fall
Since you've gone it's a losing battle
Stampeding cattle, they rattle the walls
And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door
Well, I love you so much
That it's all that I can do
Just to keep myself from telling you
That I never felt so alone before"

Now how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh you don't know the shape I'm in
I've just spent 60 days in the jail house
For the crime of having no dough, no no
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go

Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
It was all so very painless
When you ran out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
We pointed you the way to go
And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand
I want you to know that while we watched
You discovered no one would be true
That I myself was among
The ones who thought
It was just a childish thing to do

But just before she leaves, she receives
She's been down in the dunes and she's dealt with the goons
Now she drinks from the bitter cup, I'm trying to get her to give it up
She was just here, I fear she can't be here no more
And as my mind unweaves, I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives
It's long, long when she's gone, I get weary holding on
Now I'm coldly fading fast, I don't think I'm gonna last

With you in sight, the lost are found
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea
Protect my only light, cause she once belonged to me
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry
For if I live again, these hopes will never die
I can feel you standing there
But I don't see you anywhere
Standing by the well, wishing for the rains
Reaching to the clouds, for nothing else remains
Drifting in a daze, when evening will be done
Try looking through a haze
At an empty house, in the cold, cold sun
I will wait until it all goes 'round
With you in sight, the lost are found"

She just sits there
Hoping for a friend
I don't fit here
But I may have a friend to lend
Maybe I mistook her
But I can't overlook her
Must be someone
Who can pull her through

Anyone who's felt that bad
Could tell me what to say
Even if she'd just get mad
She might be better off that way
And where is all the understanding?
Her problems can't be that demanding
Why is it she looks my way
Every time she starts to cry?

Until you feel a little stronger

Has made me lonesome too

She promised she'd be there with me

Dodging lions, and a-wasting time
Oh those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes it sure has been a long, hard drive
Train wheels a-running thru the back of my memory
When I ran on a hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday everything is gonna sound like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece
Sailing round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh to be back in the land of, Coca-cola
Well I left Rome, and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried

To be loving you it’ll all be there when my dreams come true
Today you’ll make me say that I somehow have changed
Today you’ll look into my eyes, I’m just not the same
To be any more than all I am would be a lie
I’m so full of love I could burst apart and start to cry
Today, everything you want I swear it all will come true
Today, I realize how much I’m in love with you
With you standing here, I could tell the world what it means to love
To go on from here, I can’t use words they don’t say enough

It’s taken so long to come true
And it’s all for you, all for you"

Until it joins with the African sea
In moving it changes its cold and its name
The reason I come and go is the same
Animal game for me
You call it rain
But the human name
Doesn't mean shit to a tree

If you don't mind heat in your river and
Fork tongue talking from me
Swim like an eel fantastic snake
Take my love when it's free
Electric feel with me
You call it loud
But the human crowd
Doesn't mean shit to a tree

Change the strings and notes slide
Change the bridge and string shift down
Shift the notes and bridge sings
Fire eating people
Rising toys of the sun
Energy dies without body warm
Icicles ruin your gun

Water my roots the natural thing
Natural spring to the sea
Sulfur springs make my body float
Like a ship made of logs from a tree
Redwoods talk to me
Say it plainly
The human name
Doesn't mean shit to a tree

Snow called water going violent
Dam the end of the stream
Too much cold in one place breaks
That's why you might know what I mean
Consider how small you are
Compared to your scream
The human dream
Doesn't mean shit to a tree"

The shape of sleepy music and suddenly you're hooked
Through the rain upon the trees that kisses on the run
I saw you

Comin' back to me
You came to stay and live my way
Scatter my love like leaves in the wind
You always say you won't go away
But I know what it always has been
It always has been
A transparent dream beneath an occasional sigh
Most of the time I just let it go by
Now I wish it hadn't begun
I saw you
Yes I saw you
Comin' back to me
Strolling the hills overlooking the shore
I realize I've been here before
The shadow in the mist could have been anyone

Whatever happened to wishes, wished on a star?
Was it just something that I made up for fun?

You can collect all the neglect
Or all the self-respect you need, what you need

So what do you want with me?
We live but once but good things can be found around

You can't look front you cannot face tomorrow

I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside

You're standing ignoring me

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now, hey now

The first thing I saw as I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know that I want you to know
What's written inside of your head
And time as it stands won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky, I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?

May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
But if it makes you happy
Keep on clapping
Just remember I'll be by your side
And if you don't let go, it's gonna pass you by

What we don't see

What we don't touch we cannot feel

If you're honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand

Need a shoulder?
Well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do

You got how many bills to pay and how many kids?
And you forgot about the things that we did
The town where we're living has made you a man

Do you still feel like me (do you feel like me)
We sit down here and we shall see (we shall see)
We can talk and find common ground (common ground)
And we can just forget about feeling down
We can just forget about life in this town

You don't wanna be no spaceman, you just wanted gold
All the dream stealers are lying in wait
But if you wanna be a spaceman, it's still not too late

Well, it's alright, and it's alright

Searching for the truth among the lying
And answered when you've learned the art of dying
Are you still with me?

Then you must find it
But when you have it
There'll be no need for it

A perfect entity
Living through a million years of crying
Until you've realized the Art of Dying

Blow away, blow away, blow away

Sky cleared up, day turned to bright
Closing both eyes now the head filled with light
Hard to remember what a state I was in
Instant amnesia
Yang to the Yin

All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away

Wind blew in, cloud was dispersed
Rainbows appearing, the pressures were burst
Breezes a-singing, now feeling good
The moment had passed
Like I knew that it should

Rock,George Harrison,2003,Brainwashed,Any Road,"Give me, uh, plenty of that guitar

For I've been travelling on a boat and a plane
In a car, on a bike, with a bus and a train
Travelling there, travelling here
Everywhere in every gear

But, oh Lord, we pay the price
With the spin of the wheel, with the roll of the dice
Ah yeah, you pay your fare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there

And I've been travelling through the dirt and the grime
From the past to the future, through the space and the time
Travelling deep beneath the waves
In watery grottoes and mountainous caves

But, oh Lord, we've got to fight
With the thoughts in the head, with the dark and the light
No use to stop and stare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there

You may not know where you came from
May not know who you are
May not have even wondered
How you got this far

I've been travelling on a wing and a prayer
By the skin of my teeth, by the breadth of a hair
Travelling where the four winds blow
With the sun on my face, in the ice and the snow

But, ooh wee, it's a game
Sometimes you're cool, sometimes you're lame
Ah yeah, it's somewhere
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there

But, oh Lord, we pay the price
With the spin of the wheel with the roll of the dice
Ah yeah, you pay your fare
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there

I keep travelling around the bend
There was no beginning, there is no end
It wasn't born and never dies
There are no edges, there is no sides
Oh yeah, you just don't win

It's so far out, the way out is in
Bow to God and call him Sir
But if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there

And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there"

You've been stood around for years
Seen my smiles and touched my tears
How it's been a long, long time
And how you've been on my mind, my Apple Scruffs

Apple Scruffs, Apple Scruffs
How I love you, how I love you

In the fog and in the rain
Through the pleasures and the pain
On the step outside you stand
With your flowers in your hand, my Apple Scruffs
While the years they come and go
Now, your love must surely show me
That beyond all time and space
We're together face to face, my Apple Scruffs

Rock,George Harrison,2002,Brainwashed,Stuck Inside A Cloud,"Never slept so little, never smoked so much
Lost my concentration, I could even lose my touch

Well I made some exhibition, I lost my will to eat
The only thing that matters to me is to touch your lotus feet

Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud
Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud
Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud

Never been so crazy but I've never felt so sure
I wish I had the answer to give, don't even have the cure

Just talking to myself, crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I also lose my heart
I'm talking to myself and I'm crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I also lose my heart"

As this song came to me unknowingly
This song could be, you could be

This riff ain't trying to win gold medals
This riff ain't hip or square, well done or rare
May end up one more weight to bear

I want to cross you off my list

Fate seems to give my heart a twist

Living in the material world
Can't say what I'm doing here
But I hope to see much clearer
After living in the material world
I got born into the material world
Getting worn out in the material world
Use my body like a car
Taking me both near and far
Met my friends all in the material world
Met them all there in the material world
John and Paul here in the material world
Though we started out quite poor
We got 'richie' on a tour
Got caught up in the material world

From the spiritual sky
Such sweet memories have I
To the spiritual sky
How I pray
Yes I pray
That I won't get lost
Or go astray

As I'm fated for the material world
Get frustrated in the material world
Senses never gratified
Only swelling like a tide
That could drown me in the
Material world


From the spiritual sky
Such sweet memories have I
To the spiritual sky
How I pray
Yes I pray
That I won't get lost
Or go astray

While I'm living in the material world
Not much 'giving' in the material world
Got a lot of work to do
Try to get a message through
And get back out of this material world
I'm living in the material world
Living in the material world
I hope to get out of this place
By the Lord Sri Krishna's grace
My salvation from the material world"

You know I need you
You know I love you

You call me in the night (you call me in the night)
And hide behind the daylight
You're blowing like a wind, you don't let me see
You know I feel a pain (you know I feel a pain)
I'm tired of playing games with you
Though there's nothing else I want that would set me free

You know I love you

No use to no one else, they've all dried up
Watching all our lives go by
I can't believe you'd want to see me crying

I hold you in my heart (hold you in my heart)
I know that you're a part of me
But it's a must to know that you love me too

Rock,George Harrison,1974,Dark Horse,Simply Shady,"Somebody brought the juicer
I thought I'd take a sip
Came off the rails so crazy
My senses took a dip
Before the bottle hit the floor
And I'd had time to think
I was blinded by desire
The elephant turned pink

The rest is simply shady
It's all been done before
But it doesn't make life easy
That's for sure

You may think about a lady
Cause yourself a minor war
And your life won't be so easy anymore

No sooner had I sown it
When I began to reap
I was torn from shallow water
And plunged into the deep
And as I started drowning
I clung onto a straw
That somehow kept me floating
While my madness craved for more

Now the rest is simply shady
It's all been done and more
But it doesn't make life simple
That's for sure

You may think about a lady
Let her in through your front door
But your life won't be so easy anymore

A pebble in the ocean
Must've caused some kind of stir
And witnessed by the silence
Will reach from here to there
The action that I've started
Sometime I'll have to face
My influence in motion
Rebounding back through space

Now the rest is simply shady
It's all been done before
But it doesn't make life easy
That's for sure

You may think you're Sexy Sadie
Let her in through your front door
But your life won't be so easy anymore"

A splendid Michelangelo
Filled my heart with delight
Last Saturday night
Arrived believing from home
Climbed every step inside St. Peter's Dome
Claustrophobic and ex-Catholic
Last Saturday night
Now how come nobody really noticed
Puff of white smoke knocked me out
The truth is hiding, lurking, banking
Things they do at night

It's quite suspicious to say the least
Even mentioned it to my local priest
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night

I wish somebody would tell me
That it's only a show
And I'll confess, own up, let's face it
In my concrete tuxedo

It's quite suspicious to say the least
Even mentioned it to my local priest
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night

One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night
One Our Father, three Hail Marys

Rock,George Harrison,2002,Brainwashed,Rising Sun,"On the street of villains taken for a ride
You can have the devil as a guide
And crippled by the boundaries, programmed into guilt
Until your nervous system starts to tilt
And in the room of mirrors you can see for miles
But everything that's there is in disguise
Every word you've uttered and every thought you've had
Is all inside your file, the good and the bad

But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today

Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

On the avenue of sinners I have been employed
Working there until I was near destroyed
I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case
When I heard the messenger from the inner space
He was sending me a signal that for so long I had ignored
But he held on to my umbilical cord
Until the ghost of memory trapped in my body, mind
Came out of hiding to become alive
And in the rising sun
You can hear your life begin
And it's here and there, nowhere and everywhere
Though its atmosphere is rare
Oh the rising sun
And the place that it's coming from
Is inside of me and now I feel it constantly
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun"

Let me tell you when I'm way out of range
It's about a man who's cruel and mean
So promise not to cause a scene
Then heaven help the ones you love;
There's nowhere 'neath the stars above
Where you can run you know he'll find you;
It don't matter now, just look behind you
You had your warning, you knew the score;
You got it wrong, and that means war
So why'd you have to treat me rough
Your explanation's not enough
Ain't nobody but me gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you
Ain't no fish in the sea gonna sigh for you
Gonna try for you
Gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you
You see, I got a double disposition;
Sometimes I'm mean, sometimes I'm vicious
I'm Doctor Jekyll, and Mister Hyde;
So if you want to stay alive
Just give me all you've got to give
And then perhaps I'll let you live
Ain't nobody but me gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you
Ain't no fish in the sea gonna sigh for you
Gonna try for you
Gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you

Imagination's all I have
But even then you say it's bad
Just can't see
Why we disagree
In casual conversations and how they bore me
Yeah, they go on and on, endlessly
No matter what I say, you'll ignore me anyway
I might as well talk in my sleep
I could weep
You try to make me feel so small
Until there's nothing left at all
Why go on?
Just hoping that we'll get along
There's no communication left between us
But is it me or you who's to blame?
There's nothing I can do, yes you're fading out of view
Don't know if I feel joy or pain
It's such a shame
And now it seems it's all been said
If you must leave then go ahead
Should feel sad

And there's no one to shield me before your eyes
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?
I said that I can see
It's not too good for me
To be afloat in the sea of glory

Oh how you comfort me
By showing me it's a different story
Your light in the dark is real
And I know that you know it is how I feel

To tell the world of its guardian angel
Oh bring it out
So we can sing it out

Is it time, is it time, is it time

Long ago I had a dream but that's no recompense
My father was a blind man, my brother was a fool
My mother told me ""God is love""
But hatred makes the rules
Teach me to fly
So I shan't drag my feet in the sand
Give me the sky
I would take the whole world in my hand
Well, don't you tell me
I cannot last at all
Before you know I'll come and go
And make you if I can
Maybe I'm a beggar
Just check your sympathy
They throw away their gentle love
And keep their pain for me
Can we be free
In a world where to love is to own?
Well when will we see
That a man must face life all alone?
Maybe I'm a beggar
Just check your sympathy
They throw away their gentle love

Rock,Supertramp,1970,Supertramp,Words Unspoken,"Why sing a lonely song?
The whole world knows that love goes wrong
Why bruise a heart that isn't broken?
It isn't broken, it can be broken

Life's just a show for free
Come along and watch with me
The only sins are words unspoken
Words unspoken, never spoken

Sweet things come and go
Give me shame, I'll give you woe
To live for love isn't so easy
It isn't easy, it won't be easy

How all good men try
Look around and wonder why
Can they shape this world to please me?
Can they please me, should they please me?

And follow, and maybe you'll correct me
I wish you'd never met me
For I am no gentle man
Follow and while you watch and wonder
I pull the world asunder
And show you who I am

Send me a gentle dream
Of love so strange it's never seen
And prove how such a love can happen
It can happen, make it happen

Fine things don't abound
Fade away without a sound
But hope must never end or slacken
Never slacken, never slacken

And follow and maybe you'll correct me
I wish you'd never met me
I am no gentle man
Follow and while you watch and wonder
I'll pull the world asunder
And show you who I am"

I won't bother you no more

No more sorrows will I find
I've got tomorrow on my side
No more teardrops will I cry
Left my teardrops way behind
No more heartaches bother me
Don't wear my heartaches on my sleeve
It's gonna be a brand new story
What's the use of former glory
It's better not to do if you can't do right
It's time to get to celebrating
After all the years of waiting
I'm gonna have a ball if it takes all night"

Many the empty hopes his lips caress
Sorry to say his days are spent in vain
Chasing a dream of doom of nights in pain

Nothing to show for love has never been
Shadowy nights of memories of the grave
Gentle my love and sweetness sometimes sick
Keep up his time while his crimes are known

And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

Between the dead and the sleeping

Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey and yellow - white

And which is an illusion
Pinprick holes in a colourless sky,
Let insipid figures of light pass by
The mighty light of ten thousand suns
Challenges infinity and is soon gone
Night time, to some a brief interlude
To others the fear of solitude
Brave Helios wake up your steeds
Bring the warmth the countryside needs"

Lunchtime sounds so inviting
Angler Bill, he gets a thrill
Sitting, watching bobbing quill

Yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's sighs
Watch children play, they seem so wise

While thousand dollies are a dreaming
Cotton frocks and golden locks
Her palace is an orange box

Watch it count down to the end of the day

To remind myself how I tried so hard

Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

Best things come to those who wait
And it's bound to get rough on any road you take
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away

There was nowhere to hide

As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Watch it drop)
Making your heart stop
(Just before you hit the floor)
One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop

You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

Yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry
Now check this out
Ugh

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear!
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract...
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back!
C'mon, c'mon
We gotta take the power back!

The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the STRUCTURE of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Cause holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior?
Who's inferior?
Yeah we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to some of that bullshit that he learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a THING from it, yet we hang from it!
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin Weathermen)
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react

Those who compete at a level that's obsolete

With a one way ticket to the Promised Land..
With a, hole in your belly and a, gun in your hand..

And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear

You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky, kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life (No one's gonna find out)

A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (in your nightgown)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?

Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger, watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out

Sunset shadows through the trophies

We've been falling, falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging, dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision, hey

When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
Quick charade, Beyoncé, Lemonade
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
No delay, no halfway, let me hear you say
One more, one more, one more

Under the covers

I was drunk and it didn’t mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be?

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it ohhhhh)

No one wants you when you have no heart and
I’m sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You’ll never know if you don’t ever try again
So let’s try
Let’s try

Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk

I said it's all so permanent

There's no placement
No arrangement
Of words that I could say to keep these changes away

But I wasn't composed of broken bones or demon limbs

A canvas sheet accountable for such losses
Shout out to the artist who took his heart and his soul
And lost them both in the process

And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because

As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate

And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""

Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

But I tell 'em, why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?

Take me out, and finish this waste of a life

Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor

He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills a man faster than his own head
He used to see dreams at night
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes

Come crashing in like a wildfire, I’m left in awe of you
Every time I close the door, I'm left wanting more of you
I wish I had some grand sense of occasion
But I just smile and turn away
I hope you know by now
I don't know another way

When it's said and done
I am yours forever
Like I said, I'm done
I am yours forever

I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
Long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined

Rock,Mumford & Sons,2009,Sigh No More,Winter Winds,"As the winter winds litter London with lonely hearts
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""
But my heart told my head
""This time no
This time no""
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
And the time we were given will be left for the world
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
So let the memories be good for those who stay

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""
But my heart told my head
""This time no""
Yes, my heart told my head
""This time no
This time no""
Oh the shame that sent me off from the God that I once loved
Was the same that sent me into your arms
Oh, and Pestilence is won when you are lost and I am gone
And no hope, no hope will overcome
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
You'll be happy and wholesome again
When the city clears and sun ascends

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""
But my heart told my head
""This time no""

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""

Curled up in fright

To dance under dizzy silver lights
But for a moment, you were wild
With abandon like a child, just a moment

But wasn't it you who said I was not free
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace
And now it's you who's floored by fear of it all

But it's alright
Take it out on me
But it's alright
Take it out on me

These apartment walls are paper thin
And no one is trying to listen in
What to hear our doubts
Hear our whispered shouts, they don't care

Wasn't it you who said I was not free
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace
And now it's you who's floored by fear of it all

But it's alright
Take it out on me

Feel my hand round yours

In adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night
Rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded, though immortal: But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:
At once, as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all: but torture without end
Still urges
As one great furnace flamed, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible"

Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I loved

Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name

Letting people down is my thing, baby, find yourself a new gig
This town ain’t big enough for two of us
I don’t have the right name or the right looks
But I have twice the heart

And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum ""Hallelujah"" just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum ""Hallelujah"" just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu...
Hallelujah, hallelujah (Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)
Hallelujah, hallelu... (Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
Vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too..."
Rock,Fall Out Boy,2007,Infinity on High,G.I.N.A.S.F.S.,"I've loved everything about you that hurt
So let me see your moves, let me see your moves
Lips pressed close to mine
True blue
But the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants
To drive on through the night if it's a
Drive back home

Things aren't the same anymore, some nights, they get so bad
You almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep with your old
Shirts and walk through this house in your shoes, you know, it's
Strange, it's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to
Love you, I'm supposed to love you

I've already given up on myself twice
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm
Threw caution to the wind, but I've got a
Lousy arm
And I've traced your shadows on the wall, now I kiss them
Whenever I'm down, whenever I'm down
Figured on not figuring
Myself out

Things aren't the same anymore, some nights, they get so bad
I almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep with your old
Shirts and walk through this house in your shoes, you know, it's
Strange, it's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to
Love you, I'm supposed to love you

Born under a bad sign, you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
""Cross my heart and hope to die
Splintered from the headboard in my eye""
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep with your old
Shirts and walk through this house in your shoes, you know, it's
Strange, it's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to
Love you, I'm supposed to love you

Rock,Fall Out Boy,2007,Infinity on High,Thriller,"Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody, people said couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down 'til everybody came around
Welcome, it's here!


Last summer, we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, ""Now in stores!""

Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five

I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am

The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five

Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)
Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)

So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five, hehe, woo!

We won't sleep for days, we won't sleep for days

And I'm a sunshine machine

I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

When I wake up, I'm willing to take
My chances on the hope I'd forget
That you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you (for you, so...)

You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident
But I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you, the meantime, I'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at
Four in the afternoon

You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident
But I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him, one, two, three, four!

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

But we never stood a chance and I'm not sure if it matters
If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no

Your secret's out...

I know this hurts, it was meant to (It was meant to)
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter

Into microphones for attention because we're just so bored

From day one, I talked about getting out
But not forgetting about how my worst fears are letting out
He said, ""why put a new address
On the same old loneliness""
When breathing just passes the time
Until we all just get old and die
Now talking's just a waste of breath
And living's just a waste of death
And why put a new address
On the same old loneliness
And this is you and me, and me and you
Until we've got nothing left"
