To me it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlocked rasta was a Buffalo Soldier

And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, win the war for America

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction

I find myself growing in an environment
Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent
In trodding these roads of trial and tribulations
I've seen where some have died in desperation
To keep

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction

In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto (In the ghetto, in the ghetto)
Hustling is the only education I know
Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle
A situation like this is getting too hard to handle
To keep

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, all day long
Fighting against conviction

With a pregnant woman, yes
And five kids to care for
Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town
As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me
I pray the day will come when I shall be free from

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, oh, live long day
Fighting against conviction

To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury
Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy
Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeon
I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, oh live long day, now
Fighting against conviction

Now a fugitive at large
Could this be my destiny?
With no one to care for the wellfare of my family
In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure
For mind and soul would soon be weary
Just couldn't take no more

Battering down sentence, oh live long day
Fighting against conviction, children, hear me when I say
Battering down sentence, all day long
Fighting against conviction, hear me when I sing my song"

Living on earth, heat air and water in this time (rep.)
In the beginning was the word
And the word manifested itself in the flesh
Which ever become man
All because of the devine plan
Man being lower than the angels
Over all earth was as he given dominion
He devised his own destruction
But the word lives on and on
He who is weary let him come hither
He who has eves to see
Let him look yonder
He who is thirsty let him drink clear water
Drink water children
Drink my water children
For it's the age of aquarius
Can't you see its dawning, dawning
It's the age of aquarius
Can't you see its dawning, dawning
It's the age of aquarius
So keep your love lights burning. burning"

So bide up, with reasoning
Humble thyself and I'll be near thee
Bide up, with reasoning
Humble thyself and I'll protect thee
Frustrated children, humiliation was not in vain
Through effort, time and history
Have now found eternal gain for the dark clouds do bring rain
Then comes the sun to shine again
So we shall walk and not look back as living examples
Cause we're black

A fire burns for freedom, the smell of dissent is high
I'm standing for the truth, too long it's been denied
The tide of change is rising, let hope be realized
Unchain these wings, let angels fly

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

A crime against nations, a war is waged
There's a message in the wind, for every race
Peace and love we sow, so let us grow
It's good for the body, it's good for the soul

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

Sold us the kiss of death, denied us the tree of life
This damn hypocrisy, cost so many lives
Corporation greed, can't own this seed
Small farmers will survive by planting weed

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

A crucified savior, to save your face
Demonizing nature our saving grace
We got to put to good use, what the lord has gave
Fruits of the tree, the herbs of the field

A fire burns for freedom, a fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom, a fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom, a fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom, let angels fly
A fire burns for freedom, let angels fly

Malnutrition dulls my hair
My eyes are black and lifeless
With an underprivileged stare
I'm the beggar on the corner
Will no-one spare a dime
I'm the child that never learns to read
Because no one spared the time
I am a one in ten a number on a list
I am a one in ten even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care
I'm the murderer and the victim
The licence with the gun
I'm a sad and bruised old lady
In an ally in a slum
I'm a middle aged businessman
With chronic heart disease
I'm another teenage suicide
In a street that has no trees
I am a one in ten a number on a list
I am a one in ten even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care
I'm a starving third world mother
A refugee without a home
I'm a house wife hooked on Valium
I'm a Pensioner alone
I'm a cancer ridden spectre
Covering the earth
I'm another hungry baby

But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and
I merely survive because of my pride
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be in on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess, I gotta try
Many rivers to cross but just where to begin
I'm playing for time
There'll be times when I find myself thinking
Of committing some dreadful crime
I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along

Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive

I merely survive because of my pride"

We will no longer hear your command
We will seize the control from your hand
We will fan the flame of our anger and pain
And you'll feel the shame for what you do in God's name

We will fight for the right to be free
And we will build our own society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song

Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
And this is my chat (cho!)

Been searching for a long long time
For that oh-so-true love
To comfort this heart of mine
No pretense stop wasting my time
A virtuous woman is really hard to find
I'm telling you lady
I'm only human, not looking for impossibility
Just a genuine woman with sincerity
Someone who is always near to hold me
Show me you care, up front and boldly
Don't shun my feelings, all the positive meanings
Love me morning, noon all seasons

But if it means contention
I'd rather be alone
Tell the service man cut the phones
Lock all communication
If there's no light within my day
I'd rather stay in isolation
For that special someone a lifetime I'll wait
I know that I'll be okay
Cross my heart, every day I live I pray
And I know she'll come my way
Night and day for this woman I pray

Wanna be loved

Reggae,Buju Banton,1995,’Til Shiloh,It’s All Over,"Girls in supply, Buju Banton expressing his feelings
Look at the action of the girls
Lord have mercy, I am getting excited
Chorus
Woman are mashing up to town
From the head to the ground
And the men are rejoicing
It's all over
She's on the starting line
Now they're off
If you stop to look you will see everyone at last
It is the sweetness of your body that makes you excel
The girl up front, she won't last
Flourishing, nourishing, everything else
The ragamuffin could ever want
Men are craving for your body
They think it must be some glue
They tell their girlfriends they have left them
Chorus
I can't tell you how much I want you, right now
I'm coming to get you, serious talk now
You could barricade the door or your father could
Be guarding you with a 404 rifle
The rest of my life I will devote
Let's go make a martimonal house
Woman every groove and every angle fit
It must be aerobic class
I can imagine what it would be like with you
Chorus
Do it when you're young, you can't wait til youre older
Tell the girl to move, get out of the way
All the things you have expensive
Buju Banton is speaking and the world is crowed
The girl is being used and not seen any results after
Men using women like how they use plaster
Look how the girls wrecking the corner
What Buju Banton say...hea hea

It needs a love injection
I'm a calling out America

I'm a calling on the presidents
Calling all prime ministers
I'm a calling out to Russia

What joy you feel within
And when you hurt someone
What do you gain

They don't even know

Tell me what in the world
Are we waiting for
To stop love from walking
Out of that door
I'm a calling out America
Calling out to Africa

And darling sweet Jamaica
War has no winner
Fighting for power
You're fighting for land
I'm so confused
I just can't understand
You lose your family
And I lose my best friend
Hurt will be heard
Cause they all start pain
Tell me what in the world
Are we waiting for
To stop love from walking

Oooh ooh ooh
Woah woah, yeah

Story of my life
Ordinary person just like you
If you take a look inside
You'll see the great things that people do
Changing lives day and night
But nothing I do ever makes the news
Still I have to do what's right
To the King of all kings, all praise is due

Yesterday I was on a train
A little boy asked me my name
He said ""Sir, I've seen you before, tell me who are you""?

Said I am a legend that you never heard of before
I said I am a lion but you never heard me roar
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name
That means I made a change

I'm the man who cooks the food and feed the street people in the afternoon
I'm the lady with the broom sweeping the halls of your sons pre-school
I'm the soldier who's up all night, making sure everything's alright
And if you ask me I'm quite fine, being a ordinary person doing what's right

Yesterday at the football game
A little girl asked me my name
She said ""Sir, I've seen you before, tell me who are you?""

Said I am a legend that you never heard of before
Said I am a lion but you never heard me roar
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name, that means

I'm the ocean of fame
I'm an unknown sailor
I'm the percussionist playing with the Wailers
The one with the shaker, the mover and shaker
My name wasn't on the front of the paper
But mi nuh care cah
Much more than the work cah the work is greater
Creation glorifies Creator
So all deeds done are in the name of my Maker

I am a legend that you probably never hear about
Words from the lion's mouth
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name
Give praise, that means I made a change

(Legend, legend)
(I am a legend)
(Legend, legend)
(I am a legend)
(Legend, legend)

He was nailed to a cross and crucified
Now that the light came to me
I wonder if they're gonna do the same to me
And when the truth hits painfully
That's when you know if you're really who you claim to be

For so long we've been denied
Rejected and brutalized
But Jah children shall win the war
Yes, 'cause we know who we are

We're Selassie I children

We are Ethiopians by blood

Young boy threw away his comb
So his papa told him find a different home
Never come back, hold your own
Bout you're a Rasta, I wish I never know you, no!
Rejected for the life he choose
Cast out, all alone
The stone that the builder man refused
Shall be the head cornerstone

Soon they will realise
That we've been reading between the lines
Remember we foretold the war
You never forget who we are

Tell them, we're selassie children

Cos her mother just took a look in her purse
She find a clay kutchie and some holy herbs
And the wise mind of haile i the first
Mama say young girl you're losing your mind
Did you get these things from Satan
She say no mama I got the kutchie from jah9
And the wise mind from i nation

Please mama, don't scrutinise
Take this book and give it a try
Let this herb open up your eyes
Experience the wonders of Rastafari

There was nothing
Then the great spirit came down
And said it, let there be
And there was
That's how it all began, yeah
Yet still we ask
Where did the universe come from?
Everything in existence
From the sky to the depths of the ocean
Every shape, every colour, every pigment
Every sound and every vibration
This old earth, the solar system
Everything you hold so sacred
By the hands of lord we were  created

And I know love
Lifted me
And I know Jah Jah, yeah
Set me free
Love break the chains, yes
Set the captives free
Love break the chains
Set the captives free
Wa da da da da da da da

So if there was nothing
Whose voice it was that said let there be light?
Who separated the day from the night?
Created me, created you?
I believe it was love, oh yes
Still we want to know
Where did the universe come from?
Everything in existence
All yuh temples, yuh mosque and yuh churches
All the saints and the gods that we worship
The holiest of writings
The thunder and the lightning
Everything you hold so sacred
By the hands it flowed, it was created

So I know love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lifted me
And I know Jah Jah, yeah yeah
Set me free
Love breaks the chains
Love breaks the chains

He is always there by my side

Sometimes, I feel like a ship lost at sea
Is there anyone looking out for me?
Voice in the wilderness bawling, please
Please, don't let me fall, 'cause sometimes
I feel like a bird with broken wings
Being led away in the coldest wind
Who's gonna teach me to fly again? Oh, no
Look at the lillies in the field, they don't spin
But the King of kings provides for them, oh
And if the King of the kings still sits on the throne
Then, I know that I am never alone

Even in the darkest night

Though everyday's not a day with a bright sky
And, when darkness bring pain to my eye sight
Jah is the light on my way and he shines bright (Jah!)
Power a di Trinity
So, I never question: Jah, Jah divinity
If you ever doubt Selassie I abilities
Look inna yourself and answer this: tell me
Who taught the birds how to fly?
Who is the one that hangs the clouds in the sky?
And if for Moses, Jah did part the Red Sea, yeah
Then, I know that Jah is always with me
Always with me

Even in the darkest night
Selassie I, he is my light
Jah is always there by my side
And, though, sometimes, I lose my way

We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard, got us up for school every day
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us pride to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up,"" uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up

And this hope
That keep me holding on
On and on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

Boom-boom, couldn't have made it alone
I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

She said, 'Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up,' uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up

Never let yourself be overcome by pressure
Cool yah me bredda, have faith instead a
Sid-dung and a watch and all a fight one another
Blaze like fire,we nah go retire
God nah sleep and a within him we inspire
We have to reach higher for what we require
We have to make our mark before the time expire

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

That keep me holding on

My honey marches in and ask if I think I'm slick
It seem she found my shirt with lipstick
I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick
Incriminating pictures show me some other chick
It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
She ask me if I can spell the word evict

Made a little flex around by Flatbush Avenue
I'm calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
That's when I saw the boys in blue
They pulled me to the side why I don't even have a clue
Looking for a reason and they finally found a few
A case of ammunition and a loaded .32
I can't believe what I'm going through

And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow
There was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through

Keep'n it real

Even though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

I never got to have myself the house, the mansion, and the Benz
I'm not the type of brother who be making mad ends
I got myself a girl but we be kickin' it as friends
Is not enough for me now that depends
Again, not everything you want is everything you really need
The standard of society is motivated by greed
Are you prepared to follow
Tell me are you prepared to lead

Appears to come in twos and threes
Don't worry 'cause
There'll be a better day
One thing I can promise you
Just keep on keeping on

Reggae,Shaggy,2000,Hot Shot,Chica Bonita,"What is cinco cervezas I really don't know

Chica bonita you pretty like a rose
Mi senorita mi love how you a pose
Dame un beso you hot and it shows
Toca mi vida and everybody knows

Baby baby baby
Tell me what you wanna do and where you wanna go
Ain't no need to rush it baby we can take it slow
I swear it must be cupid shooting arrows with his bow
I notice in your eyes a certain glow
Have me wondering now
Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same
I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name
I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame
Your love is like an everlasting flame

What is cinco cervezas I really don't know
But this pretty little senorita said it and I liked how it flowed
What is venga mi casa I really don't know

Chica bonita you pretty like a rose

Lovely lady would you
Please give me a signal so I know you understand
Maybe I should start by making gestures with my hand
Girl you're like a rising star and I'm your biggest fan
My sweet bonita diva with the tan
Got me thinking baby
We could make a life together on the ocean shore
Paradise is where you are I'm ready to explore
Can never get enough of you it's all about amour
And happiness is knocking at your door

What is cinco cervezas I really don't know
But this pretty little senorita said it and I liked how it flowed

Girl, that's just how rude boys play
I don't have to take you there
I can please you in other ways

Across the hall, neighbors hear the sound
Mr. Lover Lover's in town
Carpet burns from being on the ground
Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan
Crash oh dawn the phone

Champion lover the best pound for pound
Take you to the clouds without going downtown

Why, why don't you just change your ways?
Won't you open up your mind?
Boy, we're living in modern days
Girl, I'm coming from the school
Where if you want the job done right
You have to use the proper tool
You never been loved until you've been filled
Filled full of pleasure from the rude boy's skill
Passion and ecstasy, you know the drill
Full up your cup 'til your juice's spill
Leave the door open just for the thrill
Now you're at the point where you can't keep still
Covered in sweat but feeling the chill
That's the effect of a lover man's pill

Tell me why you want to tease me baby (Oh yeah)
Don't you want to please me (baby)
Why you holding back when I know what's on you mind
Tell me why you want to tease me baby (Oh yeah)
Don't you want to please me (baby)

Hey boo show me you're ready
Lips looking juicy like cherry
I can almost taste your flavor girl

But it seems like you're the wrong type
Don't you ever get upset girl, I'd like to see you sweat
It just feels like you're too uptight
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna live

I wanna a freaky girl, somebody just like me
Someone who understands just what a player needs
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me
A very naughty girl that's what I need

Handcuffs, can you get freaky?
How far will you go to please me?
Whips and chains, girl are you down with that?
Strange places searching for pleasure
I want you to meet me wherever
Wearing just an overcoat and hat

Or was I right? You're the wrong type
You don't ever get upset, I ain't never seen you sweat
It just feels like you're too uptight
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna live

I wanna a freaky girl, somebody just like me
Someone who understands just what a player needs
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me
A very naughty girl that's what I need

Want a girl to love me up hug me up give it to me right
Swing from me shower curtain and from me light
Hot piece of loving carry me right through the night
I can't take the pressure when you put pan me haa
Well me love it when you ride pan me haa
Really love it when you climb pam me haa
'Cause me know you naw go hide from me haa
Freaky girl me hipe pan it hee

I wanna a freaky girl, somebody just like me
Someone who understands just what a player needs
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me

But I'm the number one champion
Tha doberman ere on the microphone stand

I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister Jean
But she was in love with Dwayne
It's been so many years but I still feel the pain
What about the girl across the street?
Took the same bus, I used to reserve her seat
But she would just sit with her friends
And the all talk about guys in Beemers and Benz
Seem like my luck took a slide
Then shorty came along and stood by my side
I couldn't give her much but she stayed
Now I'm hitting all the charts it's so easy getting laid
Living in style, I'm getting paid
Hooking up my peeps with the millions I've made
Now I'm having girls who I knew in first grade
Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played
So I'm begging you

Hey love, can I get a rain check?
Just 25 and I'm not ready yet
Hey love, let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love, got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love, I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

I wasn't popular in school, I wasn't popular in sports
All the girls I love loved the guys on the court
I feel like I been cheated of my youth
'Cause back in the days braces weren't so cute
Girls used to laugh at my suit
Now I got models in bed knocking boots, so

Hey love, can I get a rain check?
Just 25 and I'm not ready yet
Hey love, let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love, got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love, I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

I remember as a kid I used to dream
I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister Jean
But she was in love with Dwayne
It's been so many years but I still feel the pain
What about the girl across the street?
Took the same bus, I used to reserve her seat
But she would just sit with her friends
And the all talk about guys in Beemers and Benz
Seem like my luck took a slide
Then shorty came along and stood by my side

Finger pointin' but who is to blame?

Cryin' peace while inflicting pain

Man deciding another man's fate
Claiming power in their God's name

Words of love but their actions speak hate
Seems like mankind has gone insane

You're the prettiest of flowers, girl me can't complain
When I'm with you I feel so high I rise above the rain
And you no do people damage, like that bitch cocaine, no
And leave them lonely, feeling only pain
Cause your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey

Your leaves of green, your purples and blue
Has cured little kids, and old women too
And I say to myself, what a wonderful herb
And I say to myself, what a wonderful herb

Look how Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
Fi your love whole heap a man serve years
Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
And now the whole a dem a buy shares
You should be a celebrity, amongst any tree
Across the seven seas, for your energy
But you're an enemy, catching felonies
For the remedies in your recipes, whoa

Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey

Ask me how you feel, splendid indeed
With a likkle bit a black splendid weed
A purest grow indoors, not a stick nor seed
And she never force ripe, it was a real slow speed
No fertilizer, natural baby feed
No cross pollination, she's a real pure breed
Cultivated in love and she's not grown for greed
She's everything I want and also all I need

Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey"
Reggae,Damian Marley,2012,Halfway Tree,It Was Written,"And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

Well did you know the pen
Is stronger than the knife
And they can kill you once
But they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh
Is not the ending to life
Fear not of the anti-christ
Did you know that I
Exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes
Are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jheri curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
Your body’s just a vehicle
Transporting yo' soul
It's what’s inside ah people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Everyday dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take the toll

And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer

A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name
The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all begot
Lessons that you all forgot
Rasta call it shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs thru my veins

The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Careful how you entertain stranger
Selassie never born inna nuh manger
And I'm never crucify as nuh savior
Elect off himself inna the ruler
Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure
So be careful of dem cellular and pager
Cause I sign see dem I see danger
So dem great but Selaisse I greater

That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life

Me think me wanna lick upon shots
Upon a bloodclot
And fill the block with bumbaraas cops
Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in
While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And
Before another brother's in chalks And
I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him?
See us we do the crime we do the time
Y'all get away scott-free
So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me
Cause if you get me you got me you shot me
Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me
Cause my room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp is me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ramp with me
Fi see me, me don't play plenty
Chicks me blazed many
Raised plenty fi dollars
Storm upon mi prada
Watch a bomb holla
Watch 'im run, hit the floor
Told I'm come, come no
Throw ya ganja pon de air
'plah!'

And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

So watch for sticks and stones, stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road, miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air
So keep it realistic, and always be aware
The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion, can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written

Reggae,Damian Marley,2014,"Ghetto Youths International presents Set Up Shop, Vol. 2 ",Gunman World,"Two sides to a coin
And one must chose which side they join
You know?
Brotherman
Yeah
And meanwhile one man's meal
Is another man's poison
Mankind will do what they must to survive
Innit
Hear me now

In a gunman world
Any night him clock in at work
Marrow splatter, the toolbox pull
The magazine inna the two Glock full
And he's watching as the days go by
And he's counting as his peers all die
Sleeping with the rifle 'cross his chest
So he never gets a good night's rest
And then he's cranky in the morning times
And more victims have to lose their lives
The community a twist and twirl
Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world
In a gunman life
He might not come home from work one night
So every minute matter
Ignores advice
From his weeping baby mother and child
That he won't win every game he plays
So she know he'll meet his end one day
Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe
And have to take another gunman's life
What if a backstabber names his price
And how ironic if him dead from knife
The 'mount of bullet weh him put 'pon boy
Job description: kill and destroy

Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

Well in a gunman world
Life is so stressful
Back to school time come
'cuz when a gunman work
If he is successful
And the job is well done
Then there will be an unsolved crime
With no one to fill out all blank line
John Public haffi hear and deaf
Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff
Does he get nervous just like you and I?
Watching out if the police pass by
'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail
Then it's either dead house or jail
What will it cost to make a gunman rich?
How many lives before a gunman switch?
The truth me want the youth them stop ignore
Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh

Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next one fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

And when a gunman makes choice
I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind
And does a gunman think twice?
Before him takes another someone's life?
I wonder what it is a gunman say
To the Father when a gunman pray
Does he kiss his kids to bed at night?
Making sure the blanket tucked just right?
Nothing no scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no
Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no

Can you tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?"
Reggae,Damian Marley,2005,Welcome to Jamrock,Pimpa’s Paradise,"And yes y'all, you now rockin with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I slid up in here with the brothers from the Marley family, crestin, we 'gon set for y'all

Hey! She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
She's laughing when there ain't no joke, hey!!!
 (Background Singers)
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And now she's wonderin who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar like born to be wild
But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar
A waste of a sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Work the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy
She love limelight more than John Swayze
Seen more miles than a rental, Avis
She don't slow down then some day maybe
She lost then she can't find her way to safety

(Pimpa'ss paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

Check it out! She keep her head up in space like a satellite
Because she got a insatiable appetite
For stayin out late night with all the parasites
Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like
Five minutes, she stay on the move
She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself
I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
And now she on the track workin while she wastin away
It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay
Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this..
 (Background Singers)
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

For no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirtin
Now she season me and don't need rehearsin
Esteem get a beatin', life is uncertain
Ego need feedin now no one's mercy
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin
Behind the curtain she's really hurtin
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer that bring and cook the rock down
And she without sinnin will spot the first stone
The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass goin bout there own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King Of Kings lift her off the flo'
Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow

She rise and fall like a star, her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kind of scar, always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar
She always want take it to far
I doubt she ah go make it too far
She rise and fall like a star, her ride off like a car
Her face full of all kind of scar, always with fist start a war
She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar
She always want take it to far
Mi wonder if she make it so far, wuy!!!!"

Now looky here, my big ideas
Gonna get me in trouble now amongst my peers
But have no fear, no bother cry tears
You're just miles ahead when I'm ahead light years

Man a wah do some likkle bomboclaated
Weh feel like them big 'cause dem album charted
Well all bad card will be disregarded
No punk cyaan finish weh what Bob Marley started
Gong to the Zilla, I'm the Don Die-Hearted
Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet
Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it
Nah unify dem selfish like market
Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded
Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid
Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted
Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted
Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with
Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted
Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage
With Jah by my side I've got all advantage

So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat
The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit
If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique
I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak
I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week
Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek
So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek
Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet
And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt
Them bound fi self destruct, mi ago lowe dem, mek you see it
Dem sow weh dem a reap, dem think say Jah no seet
When the stage show full a demon and the club dem full a freak
And the dancehall full a pagans and dance like dem a Greek
Dem renk and dem a reek, dem pop down one a week
Dem always overdweet, but turn the other cheek
The earth is for the meek, huh

Hundred thousand photo shoot and million radio drop

You think a silver spoon or like it drop inna mi lap
Me sign a billion autograph, up to now the tour no stop
Trade privacy for privilege, it balance when it swap
Tony Rebel say a reggae put Jamaica 'pon the map
Who am I to disagree when I've been reaping up the crop
My first release was '93, when dem a feed pon Similac
First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that
Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths
The weight weh dem a carry that no heavy like me locks

What you won't and what you will
Working for your dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a youth gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five you know the drill
Weekends are a short lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

Some of us think we're too big
'Cause the system gives us jobs
Even though it's just a low paying gig
Some of us will boast and brag
And those of us who think we're small
Just because we don't have much
That's really not the case at all
There's riches that the flesh can't touch
Some of us won't respect names
Some of us won't respect loves
Some of us don't respect life
Even though we worship God
And some of us won't let go faith
No matter what the price may cost
Some of us won't practice hate
Because we still believe in love

What you won't and what you will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill

Walking home, a child gets killed
Neighbors free to shoot at will
Hurt' to see the old slave mill

Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

Most of us think we're too good
Just because material gain
If we were living as we should
Then less of us would be in pain
Those who are misunderstood
Still deserve a voice to claim
The things that are still meaningful
To each and all of us the same
And some will say the cups are full
And give Jah thanks to what we've gained
And some will say there's much more weight to pull
And them will tell you that straight up and plain
And some will think outside the box
While some of us will hold our lanes
And some of us we write the facts
While some of us a chop down cane

What men won't and what they will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Hurts to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five you know the drill
Weekends are a short-lived thrill
Sad' to see the old slave mill

Don’t let the system tame you
It’s just a part of being young
And even though they’re quick to blame you
Picking on you like a plum
Because your dream became true
Now look what they’ve become
In open sight and plain view
They’ve already had a run
So meanwhile they try to change you
It’s not over till it’s done

Don’t let that deter you
It’s all apart of growing up
And we’re all young enough to learn to
And don’t you live life in a rush

And when you feel like giving up
Remember patience is a virtue
When you fall try to get up
Have some guts, I’m trying to urge you
Be proud of owning up

And a weh mek poor people haffi live it inna fear
One shirt deh pon dem back and dem nuh have nothing more fi wear
And man one desert a done and still cannot afford a pair
Cannot find nuh vasoline fi moisturize dem daughter hair
And the bulla price a rise and it nuh dearer than the pear
An' a so mi get fi know seh heads a government nuh care
Cause the money them a share, a crate a Guiness, crate a beer
Cannot pay your little pickney school fee come to end a year

Tower of Babel, Tower of Eiffel
Twelve month a year, but thirteen disciple
Saddam, Bin Laden, Gaddafi, Idi Amin
Call of duty, drone bombin'

Contaminate and spread dirty habit

And sell it right back in the college
Meanwhile they call 'em savage

Countless warships on the high seas
Gang war and the streets full of sirens
Like Wi-Fi at the high speed
Shot a shell, like grains of rices
Mother ball, I beg dem why please
Man a fall, head a roll like lychees
One and all, get cold like night breeze
Man at arms

What will the future bring for us? What will the future bring?

Reggae,Damian Marley,2017,Stony Hill,Intro,"I pray thee
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine of such vain things?
False kings of the earth hath set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together
Against the Lord God Jah Rastafari and against his anointed, saying
Now come let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh
The Lord God Jah Rastafari shall have them in derision
But then shall he speak unto them in his wrath
And vex with them in his sore displeasure
Cah I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion
I will now declare the decree
The Lord God Jah Rastafari hath said unto I and I and I
That thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee
Now ask of I and I and I, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance
And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
Jah, shalt break them with a rod of iron
Jah, shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel, as I would say
So be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, judges of the earth
Serve the Lord God Jah Rastafari with fear, and rejoice with trembling
'Cause I and I the Son, lest he be angry
But purge from his ways, when his wrath is kindled but a little
And so blessed be all, blessed be everyone, as I would say
Blessed be everyone, as I would tell you"

Well then, most politicians fighting gainst Rasta troops
And making mistake and a tell poor people, ""Oops""

Gimme some space so I can bun dem please
Well den a big fire stick weh all a mek certain sound

No idle jubee dem couldn't, cotch pon my pillow
Weh a love man for nike an ah love man for fila
Dat's not the ways of ancient war gorilla
Me rather den to save all my sasaparilla
On a lonesome breezy sunday morning
This maiden came to town
Me have to blick a sound
How she so cute and plus so sexy and so round
Sunlight catch her skin and lord it good from head to ground
Next candidate me see wh fit, fi wear mi crown
And such tender smiles amaze me
The way that she looks on the night
She should be having my baby, my baby
The pleasure was all mine
Like yesterday news it's only for a time
Always on the go because she live a life ah crime
She don't want no man fi mind it
Di Muffin say dat he couldn't believe
I was living so blindly

She said she's born to be wild and she can't be tamed
And all she wants in life is fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving, moving right along
Even though she knows deep down inside she knows something is wrong

She can't go to London without visa
Me can't build me spliff dem without rizzla
Dem say look out the door and you know di weather
Me start put two an two together
First class flights and she drinks the most expensive wines
When she can't maintain her lifestyle up on the minumum wages
She needs the coil and just like a stubborn mule
I would tell that is all she's worth
Well tha smuggling and trafficking of ilegal substances is her line of work
Me say a good woman ration
Most of di gyal dem get so caught up inna fashion
Love vanity dem seem dem love it with a passion
Start to used dem body for some dirty profession
Seem like dem need spiritual supervision
Ital craft and a ital vision
Righteous path and a righteous decision
Instead of di materialistic religion
Else there's gonna be a crash course and collision

She said she's born to be wild and she can't be tamed
And all she wants in life is fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving, moving right along

Implied jizabell, and them Grow concubine
Can’t see the truth them must be blind, them blind

And all of them playaz and still them rewind
You walk with your nine keep one thing in mind

Give me the microphone and burn down Rome
And all of them Churches which cast them stone
And fight against the lion of the royal throne
And  danger zone
The world become a graveyard of skulls and bones
And mount Zion is the the safest crown
Upon a holy mountain the city was found
That’s where the  choice to wear them crown

I'm glad to know I'm not alone because
Rastafari's my custodian

Sativas don't like too much sodium
The seeds can replace your petroleum
The leaves have a skunky aroma scent
THC make you feel like it's heaven-sent
CBD is to me like a medicine
Do some research and you'll be pleased by the evidence
Perhaps you cultivate some trees in your residence
And agree to disagree with the Presidents
Tell the Prime Ministers please don't be hesitant
To let the herbs grow and be free!

Got a new, got a new love in open eyes
Break away, break away the old ways and live high
Got a new course for the light

You picked me up from the depth I've never known
And you showed me a life of love, trust and hope

Marijuana whey me smoke them say it too ignorant
Just some other day, some po po hold me for one
Then my brother Juju and my I-thren name Dan
Bounce and listen to Gong we mashin' up the traffic jam
Police pull me over talking 'bout him smell corn
From me look inna him face me know this boy have a plan
Juju touch me 'pon my shoulder, say the boy ah demon
First thing him want to know is where that smell is coming from
Are you smokin' marijuana? and I said, yes I am
True him see say some mentions, say, it cost a couple grand
Him say make me see the license and registration
And where are you headed? What's your occupation?
Done know, say, ragamuffin nah go answer question
As is says on the paper, read the information
From me nah go take no street side interrogation
So book me, if you ah book me, carry down ah station
Make me show them how we did it inna style and pattern


I'm the judge, the lawyer Jury, and my own bails man
And if you check it out that would be my station
Settle Juju royal from you run England
And when your plane land you nah go through no customs
This is ragamuffin in a different pattern
Me nah go inna no session unless it conk and ram
And from you see we face no bother ask no question
And anywhere we go we haffi ra pa pom, pom


Well, if ah ganja dem ah look for, them know where to find us
Well, we ah no criminal, say Rasta ever righteous
Some boy a scope out the ride how we ah drive and puff
And him jealous how we so shine and buff
And him jealous how we so shine and buff
Well, from him look inna the car and how the interior plush
And look upon the rims, how them full out and flush
And ah scope out we jewels him ah wonder how much
And him jealous cause them here price can't touch

Then me say royal have a new tune fi rise and bust

A boy dig down the car until him find some stuff
And him jealous cause we so rank and 'nuff

Him make Sarg cause a few stripes there 'pon him shoulder
Cause him too par with we, we there when demus show love

Reggae,Stephen Marley,2011,"Revelation, Part 1: The Root of Life",Made In Africa,"Scholars and scientists now conceive that Africa is the first place of mankind
Africans were the first builders of civilization
They discovered mathematics, invented writing, developed sciences
Engineering, medicine, religion, fine arts, and built the Great Pyramids
An architectural achievement which still baffles modern scientists'

The 225th Emperor direct descent from Solomon and The Queen of Sheba
He is the ""King of Kings, The Lion of Judah""
The name Haile Selassie I means ""Power of the Trinity""

Educate yourselves, of Africa
To liberate yourself, Africa
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
Eeeeyh
Our history that they stole, Africa
Is written in our souls, Africa
Oldest nation on this earth
Know just what you worth
Well well
Ships that sail to distant places
Robbed us of our rights and worth
History says that you've betrayed us
Talking of the Gods you serve
Hear the rambling in the sky
Tears that our forefathers cry
And today we're still in chains
Take the shackle from our minds
You're the cornerstone
The king upon the throne
How beautiful are thou, Africa
All nation have to bow, Africa
Don't you fall from grace
You're that secret place
Aye! Aye-ah-aye!

Power to the people, Motherland representa
I'm on trial with the man she my co-defendant
And I demand her attention, can you focus women?
I'm getting closer to the sky errytime I hit it
Haile Selassie I, ""Power of the Trinity""
Soul made in naija, my vice made in Italy
White mans world that I'm livin' in, some say
But it was Africa the continent we all came from
Can't nothing come between me and you
So before I have seeds gotta understand my roots
Gotta understand the truth. We is all king's 'round here
Life's not all fair, work till we fall dead
Paul goin' hard 'till I urn like a Pall-Bearer
Although my body's in the U.S my heart's there
I can never be ashamed of her
I got my features and my name from her; mama Africa

The richest place on earth
Know just what your worth

Talking about the God you serve

Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
They infiltrate our homes, Africa
They claim it as their own, Africa
Now we must stand tall
To break down all these wall-alls
Well well
Our children must be taught, of Africa
The science and the art, Africa
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nahhh!
Educate yourself, Africa
To liberate yourselves, Africa
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
Beautiful are thou, Africa
A legend have to bow, Africa

Ya know? (Ya know...)

Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel
But I'm seeing change gradual, I went from an apartment to a castle
Gravel on my feet, you see I took a lot of losses
Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless

Gained lot of scars walking on this road
Had my share of problems, only God knows
I came from kicking doors to a million records sold
I'm a platinum artist but my wrist gold
Rather it's my freedom than to live broke
Still top swinging in this black Ghost
Tell the dealer give me mounts with no mirrors
Only looking forward, what I gotta look back for?
Cause the past 20/20 when it hindsight
Can't see these  in my blind side
Only smoke the best to keep my mind right
Cause  can get sour when you're in the limelight
Used to be apartments now I'm sleeping in a mansion
Now I'm doing shows, baby dropping out them panties
Got it on my own, never had nothing handed
If you ain't come from where I come from, then you wouldn't understand it (Flocka)

Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless

I done been through the headaches and the hassles
But only God can judge me with the gavel
They say I can't rap but I can make millions
So I don't care for your opinions, I ain't asked you
I'm from south side Clayco got a tattoo
I'm a street  did what I had to
So we had to war, yeah I dabbled
Coming up wasn't easy did it gradual
Bullet scars on my body had to battle
For my life, guess this karma coming back for me
For the dirt that I did, for this fast money
Just counting callouses feet from the travel
Bounce back, what ain't kill me made me stronger
Live for today cause tomorrow never promised
Just a couple years ago we was broke (broke)
Now my bank account full of commas

I'm doing donuts in the parking lot in my Ferrari
I love my people, I do this for my people
See the evil, why we need to be illegal?
And hella reefer, fall asleep, and wake up to the reaper
Take a leap of faith, lose the hate and love your people
I make beats and smoking doobies chillin' in Jamaica
Cross me and I'mma introduce you to your maker
I can't hear these suckers scheming, I know they some haters
You can copy the machine or make the paper
Or you could be original, reach pinnacles
Alcohol and kush, that's my vitamins and minerals
Chilling with my girl, skinny dipping in the swimming pool

Reggae,Stephen Marley,2016,Revelation Pt. II: “The Fruit of Life”,Father of the Man,"I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame

Deeds are fruits
Words are but leaves
It's better to do well than to say well indeed
So if you come from the rock
Please don't run from the rock
Keep your conscious clean and put the wave upon your back
A fool is filder leaves out the common stone
But every dart feels like a lion in his home
My destiny is in my own hands
Cause the child is the father of the man so

I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame

Ragga It's been a minute man let's go
I went from cavemen to slavemen
Church scream amen and then they lych men
Boy charter 911 before the world trade
I saw the world through Ray Charles shades
Tried to warn them they ain't wanna listen
Nostradamus saw the bird's now there's two thing's missing
Two sons sitting Hussein's son sitting so calm they father Saddam hung in a prison
I'll be damned if a man put a tech in my hand have me in the sand shooting at the ground man
Runner becomes the gunner and the gun will become the hunted the hunted become the hunted on America's most wanted
How does America's most wanted get apprehended
When his man turns state on his co defendant
You need a lawyer let me talk for you
You in a wheelchair blood let me walk for you
I'm a leader

I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame

Yeah yeah yeah what if Martin Luther stayed in the room never step foot in the balcony
What if they had a bullet proof car instead of a drop top for Kennedy
Malcolm did the speech  congregation
So when them boys come get yo hands outta pocket
Five shots of the assassins Ragga
Ain't nothing new under the sun
What if I had put blanks in Marvin Gaye's firer’s gun
What if you all knew the truth before sending your kids to war
Told ya that man ain't care about Iraq
He cared about the oil
When your thinking about how many records you gonna sell
I think about getting all my people out the cell
We put in work ya’ll ain't revolutionary cause you gotta a Che Guevara T-shirt
It's just a T-shirt
Ragga why you think I ran for president
I got 5 cribs and they said I got no residence
They tried to punk me but I was born with no fear
So I'm a run it like 10 years

I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame"
Reggae,Stephen Marley,2016,Revelation Pt. II: “The Fruit of Life”,Babylon,"Babylon...

Look what they doing, despicable, inhuman
And got the nerve to say that I'm 3/5ths of a human
Babylon is in ruins, inhabited by a beast
A bloodsucker, vampire to say the least
Look at the way that they're gnashing their teeth as they feast
Fighting to get a piece, something like Ancient Greece
Permanent Halloween, Trick or Treat
We're walking like zombies out in these streets
Shackled our hands and feet,
What you see?

Down there in Babylon
Where transgression increases
There they know no love
Hopeless are the days
Hold I stead 'Fari (JAH!)
From their wicked life
Smiles upon their faces
Evil in their hearts
Oh my, oh
Oh a oh, oh I

Babylon, Babylon
Babylon I know mi know
Yuh kingdom a go fall down
Jah will never give you the crown
Babylon I know mi know
Yuh kingdom a go fall down
Long you try fi hold Rasta down
Babylon I know mi know
Yuh kingdom a go fall down
Rasta nuh 'fraid of no clown

Babylon is a Devil in a blue dress
Satan in a suit and tie
Oppression is freedom, Heaven is Hell
And the truth is a lie
They murder the youth, the police don't shoot in the sky
It's a warzone, you do what you gotta do to survive
You get suited and ride, life is hustle or starve
This is capitalism religion, money is God
America eats the young like cannibal breakfast
Wall Street is swarming with Hannibal Lecters
Crooked elections, politricks of the shitstem
Legal lynchings, modern day crucifixions
Slaves to the current conditions that we live in
More faith in the reverends than making our own heaven
It's foul how the youth glued to the television
Ain't heard of Assata but twitter following Paris Hilton
It's only right we want to be more than poor and righteous but
Even the rich today can't ignore the crisis in Babylon..."

No heart's got to find guarantee
Girl, your love can depend on me

You would surely see your name next to mine
And you would surely see your name next to mine
You would surely see your name next to mine"
Reggae,Stephen Marley,2016,Revelation Pt. II: “The Fruit of Life”,Walking Away,"This is, it's not your ordinary type of love song
Matter of fact I mean every word I say

Weight on my shoulder but my heart is free
Telling me something I mostly agree
This little lesson I'm learning real well, well
Well well well
Pass through the country where we used to live
All of those people, their blessing to give
Trying to defend their truth and rights, well
Well well well
And I say, and it's easier
To say what hard to do
Good things to one another
Should have done for you
And it's hard to say when it's easy to do
Bad things to one another
Like I did to you

And I saw you walking away
My soul was crying that day
Never knew love was this way
Whoa well well well
And I see you walking away
My heart goes crying each day
Never knew love was this way
Yeah, and then I say

It's so easy to say what hard to do
Good things, good things, good things
I'd love to do for you
It's hard to say when it's easy to do
Bad things, bad things, bad things
I couldn't do to you
Weight on my shoulder but my heart is free
Telling me something I mostly agree
This little lesson I'm learning real well, well
Well well well
Pass through the country where we used to live
All of those people, their blessing to give
Trying to defend their truth and right, well

Reggae,Stephen Marley,2016,Revelation Pt. II: “The Fruit of Life”,Outro,"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor, that's not my business
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone, if possible, Jew, Gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery
We don't want to hate and despise one another
In this world there is room for everyone
And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate
Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind
We think too much and feel too little
More than machinery we need humanity
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men
Cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world
Millions of despairing men, women and little children
Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people
To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress..
The hate of men will pass and dictators die
And the power they took from the people, will return to the people
And so long as men die liberty will never perish
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you
Who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men
Machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts
You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty
In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written
""The kingdom of God is within man"", not one man, nor a group of men
But in all men, in you, the people, you the people have the power
The power to create machines, the power to create happiness
You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful
To make this life a wonderful adventure
Let us use that power, let us all unite
Let us fight for a new world, a decent world
That will give men a chance to work
That will give you the future and old age and security
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power
But they lie, they do not fulfil their promise, they never will
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise, let us fight to free the world
To do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness
Soldiers, let us all unite!"
Reggae,Maxi Priest,1990,Bonafide ,Close To You,"She was a Jezebel
Miss Brixton queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream
Telling me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
Spinning around
Like a wheel on fire
Walking the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down
So emotional
Gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly
When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt
Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
(She was a Jezebel
This bursting queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream)
Telling me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
I just wanna be close to you
(Spinning around like a wheel on fire)
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me
I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel"
Reggae,Maxi Priest,1998,How Stella Got Her Groove Back (Soundtrack),Art Of Seduction,"Her skin smells so beautiful
This woman's a thrill and I'm so curious, but I already know
She's a man killer, pulling me in
And I'm losing my mind
She's got a sex appeal beyond imagination
And she knows how to use it to get what she wants
Using her body and emotion
And she's using it well, using it well
She makes me want to want her
Want to want her, want to want her
She's pulling me in, pulling me in
Want to want her, want to want her
Pulling me in, pulling me in
Using the art of seduction
Watching the way she moves
She gets me in the mood
Makes me feel hot inside
Baby, just let me ride
I like the things you do
So why don't you do them to me?
You got me going crazy
Baby, baby, baby
And she knows how to use it to get what she wants
Using her body and emotion
And she's using it well, using it well
She makes me want to want her
Want to want her, want to want her
She's pulling me in, pulling me in
Want to want her, want to want her
Want to want her, want to want he
And I like it"

Bleib kalt, zeig niemals Liebe und es geht, Negro
Für 'ne kurze Zeit sorgenfrei
Doch bleibt dein Herz kalt, ist es schnell vorbei

Ich hatte nie was, doch bald ist auch Gold dabei
Mama trennte sich, als ich zwölf war
Ich war gebrochen, doch draußen war ich öfter
Voll mit Hass, guck, vermisste meine Schwester
Verdrängte Probleme und wein'n tat ich gestern
Wurde materieller, ich wurde kälter
Ich wollte auch mal die Air Max haben, schneller
Schon im Innenhof falsche Gesichter
Als ich mich wegdrehte, war ich für sie nichts, lan
Ich war ein Kind, Mann, ich wollte nicht begreifen
Ich wollte auch so sein, obwohl sie auf mich scheißen
Ich war am beten, kniete vor der Fensterbank
Wollte Gott fragen: „Was mach' ich falsch, verdammt?“
Die Welt ist kalt und zerfetzt dich, wenn du ehrlich bist
Halt dich fest an dei'm Traum, weil es mehr nicht gibt
Papa weinte oft, er hatte viel im Kopf
War frustriert, bis er Fäuste an die Wände boxt
Guck, ich check' es doch, ich bin anders, Bruder
Schon seit Tag eins gesagt bekomm'n, ich leide drunter
Doch die Geschichte macht mich zu dem, was ich bin
Es war zwar gestern, doch innerlich immer Kind
Jeder hat sein'n Struggle, jeder hat sein'n Kampf
Hol dir dein Batz, erst dann wird es anerkannt
Doch verlier den Glauben nie
Auch wenn der Hass überwiegt, ich kämpf', ich geh' meinen Weg

Ich gehe meinen Weg, (ja, Negro, ja)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (ja), ich gehe meinen Weg (ja)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (Negro, ja, Negro)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (ja), ich gehe meinen Weg (Negro, ja)
Guck, ich gehe mein Weg

Papa hatte es satt
Ich war am Boden, alles fuckte mich ab
Voll bekifft durch die Stadt
Guck, der Druck macht dich platt
Tagelang einsam, zu viel vom Paff und der Hunger hält dich wach
Und es droht dir der Knast, du musst gucken, was du hast
Und dein Kopf geht kaputt, du musst gucken, dass du's schaffst
Guck mein Herz war voll Hass, im Gesicht war ich blass
War betäubt, war zu straff und die Hoffnungen wurden knapp, Negro
Doch ich gab niemals auf, Negro
Bunkerte das Sattla im Haus, Negro
Wusste schon damals, ich will raus, Negro
Doch war beklemmt, meine Seele war zu taub, Negro
Verlor den Glauben nie, auch wenn der Hass überwiegt
Ich kämpf', ich gehe meinen Weg, Negro
Ich gehe meinen Weg, Negro, ich gehe meinen Weg, Negro

Ich gehe meinen Weg, (ja, Negro, ja)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (ja), ich gehe meinen Weg (ja)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (Negro, ja, Negro)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (ja), ich gehe meinen Weg (Negro, ja)
Guck, ich gehe mein Weg

Bin verwirrt, hoff', ich finde meine Linie
Ging nur halbe Wege, erreichte nie die Ziele
Ich betrug, raubte und dealte
Ich paffte zu viel, es war egal, guck, ich fliege
Ich kannte keine Liebe, führte innerliche Kriege
Ich wusste nie, was ich fühlte, nie, was ich wollte
Mein Kopf brachte mich runter, meine Psyche ging schrott
Jetzt bin ich raus aus der Tiefe
Papa, ich weiß es doch, du wolltest stolz sein
Ich brauchte länger, doch heut bring' ich dir dein Gold rein
Mama, ich weiß, mir fehlt der Bezug zu dir
Doch ich schwör's dir bei Gott: Ich bleib gut zu dir
Doch mein Herz ist jetzt kalt
Meine Seele eiskalt, guck, mir fehlt jetzt der Halt
Doch verlier' den Glauben nie
Auch wenn der Hass überwiegt, ich kämpf', ich gehe mein'n Weg, Negro

Ich gehe meinen Weg, (ja, Negro, ja)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (ja), ich gehe meinen Weg (ja)
Ich gehe meinen Weg (Negro, ja, Negro)

Come in!

Don't have to be No Supastar (Supastar, Supastar)
Just gotta be just who you are, oh-whoa
In everyone there's a sense of purpose
That's right so Babylon don't you try to control us

Africans who we are, every nigga is a star
Well, the top is where I'm headin far
Pretty chicks and fancy cars, and a nigga into Mars
Drink champagne, dem yam too much caviar
True players in a bar, some of dem smoke a dem cigars
Drown them fools and now we make dem bizarres
Stole the cookie from the jar but you never took him far
Well, him and Killah Priest gon' never spar


We live in poverty due to prophecy from our ancestors
We all transgressors, uh Moses let us
Now cops arrest us, until the jake, job bless us
Left false scriptures to protect us
Rightful ears, the Solomon's sceptors
True Isrealians, Rastafarians
We handle beef like vegetarians, we very sinned
My players sip Dacari's, we live the life of Judas Maccabee
Black fatigues with our hair raggety!
We all Supastars even without +CREAM+ and cars


Know why? Street tycoon up before high noon
Followed by the spot, zoom lens, ghetto peepers singin my tune
They say I'ma die soon, livin without time, sketchin my outline
(It's a hitman!) Too late to make a speedy recovery
Lovely, with shots that done smmothered me and covered me
Choppers above of me, what a startling discovery
Our own brother be the one with the killer instinct
Just because I'm a so-called star


Well, I just wanna be myself, I don't need nobody else
Working for long life, and good health
No whats about the wealth, see that's the way I felt
I'm okay, confide in God, will help
Tried to put me on the shelf cuz I'm so excellent
Damn you nowhere with no persistence
You don't want no selfish thing, don't have no confidence
Well, you don't have to be a star to be yourself"
Reggae,Lucky Dube,1992,House of Exile,It’s Not Easy,"I remember the day I called mama on the telephone
I told her mama I'm getting married
I could hear her voice on the other side of the telephone she was smiling
And she asked me a question that I proudly answered
She said son did you take time to know her
I said mama she's the best
But today it hurts me so
To go back to mama and say mama I
'm getting divorced
Oh I'm getting divorced
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would  it hurts me so mama
Mama said to me

It's not easy to understand it son
But I hope you'll make it 
You'll be happy again
I remember in church
When the preacher read the scriptures
You looked so beautiful and innocent
I did not know that behind that beauty
Lies the true colors that will destroy me in the near future
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would be 
Now I'm hurting
I remember when I held you
By the hand preacherman read the scriptures
Putting words in your mouth
Maybe what the preacherman said was not something that was within you
Now I know what they mean when they say
Beautiful woman is another man's plaything
Oh Lord I'm hurting now

Reggae,Lucky Dube,1991,House of Exile,House Of Exile,"Freedom fighter standing on a mountain
In a foreign country
Trying to send a message
To his people, back in the ghetto
He had a home one time
Love of a girl
But he left that behind
Oh yes I can hear him clearly as he whispers in the air
His voice came out loud and clear
All he asked for was a prayer and as he turns to walk away he said

I'm still here in the house of exile
For the love of the nation

Sun went down on the mountain
Birds flew back to their hiding places
Leaving him standing there like a telephone pole
In the still of the night
You and I dream
Dreaming of Romeo & Juliet
All he dreams about is the freedom of the nation
When every man will be equal In the eyes of the law
As he closes his eyes
For the last time he said again

I'm still here in the house of exile
For the love of the nation"

To build up a good reputation
But it takes one stupid fool
To destroy everything they done

The world knows your nation as
The most oppresive in the world
Take it upon yourself
To restore your nation's dignity
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho
Chorus:
Teach the world
Teach them right
It takes a million lives
To get the respect you deserve
When people see your kind
Some of them would run a mile
The world knows your people as
A nation of crooks
Everyone around you should
Always keep their eyes opened
The world knows your nation as
A nation of drug lords
Everyone blames your people
For the destruction of the world
Take it upon yourself
To restore your nation's dignity
Ho ho ho ho ho ho

Told them I was not good around you

It didn' t mean she was deaf and dumb
She looks one look at the man
Throws her hands in the air
And said God help us all
Too much power in one mans hands
Is dangerous
She has never tasted freedom
And all the things
We take for granted
Then she looked at me and said
Son, Is this the end of our suffering?

Is this freedom?
Is this freedom?
We have just witnessed the
Change of power from one fool
And liar to another
Our lives on the line again

She has seen corruption
She has seen racism
And any other kind of suffering

She was worried about their friends
Even when they turned twenty five
She was worried about the company they'd keep

The boys in blue standing at the door
The look on their faces scared her enough
Before they told her what she was always afraid of
Chorus
Do you know where your son/daughter is tonight
I'm afraid they won't be coming home tonight
Ever since she was brought to this home
She's been cursing every woman with a child
She says they brought to this world the curse
That have stained the good name of mankind
One day it was three in the morning
The guard came running to tell us she's gone
Blue lights flashing everywhere
All over again
The boys in blue, looking for her
The look on their faces
Scared us enough when they told us to strengthen our family ties

Where the sky meets the land

Her marriage is on the rocks

She thinks about the church
And everybody that thought
They had it made in heaven
Suddenly the comfort
In the house don' t mean nothing
All she needs is some loving
In her life
Oh God

Put a little love
In my world

I can' t tell you right now

About this time
The vows she took
Were a mere formality
But in her life
They became a reality
And by the look of things
She' s fighting a losing battle
Joleen is about to take her man
Why do bad things happen
To good people?

She thinks about her children
She thinks about the church
Suddenly the money in the house
Don' t mean nothing
All she needs is love

30 pieces of silver, I said that was the price
You see the value man woulda put pon the blood of Christ
For Joseph it was 20, they never liked his coat
For Bob a coulda more they never liked of what he spoke
In spite of all these notes I see the pattern them developing
Morality's secondary to money, greed and jealousy
That's how many fell, you see, and with that being said
I‘d wondered if my brothers put a price upon my head

Heard that money makes friends
And money makes foes
But money, it is not all
Cause when the dough ends
And all the banks close
Tell me: Who can you call?
Who can you call

Who can you call

I've seen empires fall and wither down to dust
And all the money in the world, it could not lift them up
Most brilliant of ornaments crumble down to rust
Because we put we faith in lust and disregard the trust
Hell I know the rush
I've had the feeling take me over
The power in my hand when all the band over my shoulder
The bands of money coming in will change the ones around you
Be wise, you know, because it cannot stop you getting older
But still
I admit that I get caught up in the game
Saw the legends do it naturally I did the same
So I'm rolling round the city Miss Jamaica deh deh with me
Earth deh pon me platter knowing all of this no matter

Cause money makes friends
And money makes foes
But money, it is not all
Cause when the dough ends
And all the banks close

And do you think that, with the last breath that you take
You‘ll be sitting thinking 'bout the money that you made
Houses that you lived in, cars you drove, the bills you paid?
And yet it is the focus what we do and what we say
What we give we energy
So you spend your life a work
Acting like the money will be with you in the hearse
Leaving all your family and friends to fight and search
That's when you see the snakes come out and act like they deserve
Like them put you pon reserve

Told you money makes friends
And money makes foes
But money, it is not all
Cause when the dough ends
And all the banks close

Now those days are gone there's nothing left to do
Now you're alone with all those secrets you keep
Keeping you up and you can't go back to sleep
Sleeping around to find a happier place
Placing your heart inside a lonelier space
I guess you thought things would get better with time
Not knowing what we had was one of a kind (one of a kind)
Now you're afraid to look at who you've become
An empty soul on the run

A spend the money them don’t have pon what them don’t need
And ‘cause them don’t read that mean it don’t reason
A time for which there is just no season

I have found a reason to be thankful everyday since I said I would
What is shown, it’s not necessarily the things them that mean you no good
So be sure, when you troddin' on you way
‘Member say you not alone inna the ting
Watch you focus, life so glorious
When you know it's just part of growing up, growing up"
Reggae,Protoje,2013,The 8 Year Affair,Music From My Heart,"I'm just making music from my heart
Not music for the charts, no
No, I won’t get caught up in all of the things dem woulda start
To stray I from I path
Won't fall victim to dem conduct
I'm making music from my heart
Not music for the charts, no, no
With all the things dem coulda start
To stray I from I path
Won’t, won’t

Now I see what is my responsibility
The blessings I’ve received, I must do my best to lead then
Cah when people they stand in front of me with them ears attentively
Well then I do my best to reach them
For if I am making music from my soul and know my role
Well then it cannot get depleted
So divine when these energies align, thoughts flow from mind
So I know that I

I'm just making music from my heart

Mommy, if I never win a Grammy don't you ever cry for me
No billboard up in the sky for me
If I never get to put a plaque on Don's wall
I'll appreciate the fact that even one sold
Daddy, do you see yourself when you look at me?
I look at you and feel like that is what I've got to be
And so my strategy is to stay ‘way from the vanity

That I would make my

Not music for the charts, no, no
With all the things dem woulda start
Just to stray I from I path
Won’t, won’t

Said no I will not pick a fight with my brothers just to get to the top
When I write, it’s truth and rights incite in every drop
Represent for all the younger ones that’s coming up
And show them love
No competition, it’s not “I,” it’s “us”
See, for all our times will come and go
When there’ll be no more lights, and there’ll be no more shows
And no more interviews, and no more people saying they loving you
I'm telling you, and then we'll know

I'm just making music from my heart
Not music for the charts, no
No, I won’t get caught up in all of the things dem woulda start
To stray I from I path
Won't fall victim to dem conduct
I'm making music from my heart
Not music for the charts, no, no
No, I won’t get caught up in all of the things dem woulda start
To stray I from I path
Won't fall victim to dem conduct

No, no
Yeah, yeah
No, hey, hey

No, no, no, no, hey
So I give thanks for the ones that before us, you know?
And for the ones that forward, you know?
Treat the music with respect

Don't need no doctor right ya know I need my lover
Ya can't resist, no escape
The feeling start creeping up coming your way
Can't do ah thing no matter what they say
Ya find yourself walking around daydreaming
Roses being red and violets blue

Looks like something ah go 'round, love's contagious
Something ah go 'round, but it's the sweetest sickness
Feeling inside bubbling over
You get a feeling inside bubbling over
Look like something a go 'round
Love's contagious, I don't need to be cured
Woman you fill my prescription, feel like a new man
You're like my vitamin you keep me coming

Woman I need you so, never letting you go
And when your love attacked me
I couldn't do a thing about it, no
Me na wan fi see no pharmacist no

All me wan ya do is diagnose me
Fill me up with all of your good stuff girl
Fill me up woman, I'm your patient
And I know it's real the way I feel
No defense ya might get hook
Stop wonder if them tie you or if it's love bush
Symptoms start show and now you got de look

Scientists ah search fi find an antidote
Caan do a thing dem experiment all 'bout
So don't feel guilty, like it's a sin

A likkle something ah go 'round, love's contagious
Something ah go 'round, but it's the sweetest sickness
