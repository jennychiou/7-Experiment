Country,Johnny Cash,1955,Johnny Cash With His Hot and Blue Guitar,Folsom Prison Blues,"I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"
Country,Johnny Cash,2002,American IV: The Man Comes Around,The Man Comes Around,"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see."" And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going 'round taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till Armageddon no salaam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him"

You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye!""

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me: ""Why, why, why?""
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry"
Country,Johnny Cash,2002,American IV: The Man Comes Around,I Hung My Head,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head and my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
""Why had I run?""
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find""
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head

Country,Johnny Cash,1979,Silver,Ghost Riders in the Sky,"An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy drawl
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on, hear their cry
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell from ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies""

My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing

Country,Johnny Cash,1964,Bitter Tears: Ballads Of The American Indian,The Ballad of Ira Hayes,"Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when the Indians dance

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died"

San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman, you can't understand
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good

Country,Johnny Cash,1970,Classic Cash: Hall of Fame Series,Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down"

Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wondering why I'm wanted at some town half way in between

Wanted man in Baton Rouge

Country,Johnny Cash,2002,Johnny Cash Sings the Ballads of the True West,Streets of Laredo,"As I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
""Come and sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die""
""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card-house and then down to Rose's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall""
""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong""
""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother
And tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on""
When this he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker we made to this day
We beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, lay the sod over him
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong"
Country,Johnny Cash,1966,Everybody Loves a Nut,The One on the Right Is on the Left,"There once was a musical troupe
A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist
This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all
Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, ""Oh dear""
Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself
Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted"

But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong

But weak to watch without speaking
Oh what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait

Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television

Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
On why we waited until so late
Was there no oil to excavate
No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

It's buried in the countryside
It's exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries

Country,George Strait,2008,Troubadour,I Saw God Today,"Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see
The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today

Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle

I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm

At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin

And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are

I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are"
Country,George Strait,2006,It Just Comes Natural,Give It Away,"She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said

That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said, just give it away

Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
Just give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
She said, give it away
Just give it away

Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away


So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore
Mmm, like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where all our love was made
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away

I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I can't even give it away"

Country,George Strait,1996,Blue Clear Sky,I Can Still Make Cheyenne,"Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind

He said, ""It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?""

She said, ""Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.""
He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

He left that phone dangling off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

She said, ""Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.""

She'd done this before, but this time she didn't cry

After she packed, when she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes
And that's got me worried thinking
Maybe my baby's gotten good at goodbye

All the times before she'd break down and cry
She'd make her threats, but her heart wasn't set on goodbye
She just wanted me to hear what she had to say

Where his blood and sweat and tears are still in that red dirt

You’ll end up on some road somewhere
With your thumb up in the air

Take me to Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antone
Houston, Laredo, Galveston
Or Austin, maybe Abilene

Sing about the way a good man
Works until the daylight's gone
Sing the rain on the roof on a summer night
Where they still know wrong from right

And you feel mother nature walk along with you
Where simple people living side by side
Still wave to their neighbor when they're driving by"
Country,Dolly Parton,1971,Coat of Many Colors,Coat of Many Colors,"Back through the years
I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together
Sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my mama made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me

And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story
Mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it

Only if they choose to be

But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me
Made just for me"

But I will always love you

And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

Velvet-cushioned seats and soft armrests
Best seat in my favorite movie house
Start my dreaming as the lights go out
Up on the silver screen, I picture me
Living out my passions, hopes, and fantasies

I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the glint in her eyes
The girl that seldom loses
Beautiful, with grace and style
Acting out her story
Standing in her glory
Happy ever after
I want to be the girl in the movies

Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent
Watching others live their lives with confidence
Here's a preview of some things to come
It's not too late for me to be someone
I can't keep living in their make-believe
Coming attractions will be starring me

I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the stars in her eyes (In her eyes)
She gets the roles she chooses
She can laugh or she can cry
Acting in her story
Standing in her glory
Always happy endings
I want to be the girl in the movies

It's time I show the world just what I'm about
I'm steppin' up and I'm steppin' out
I'm feelin' bold and I'm feelin' proud
I want to be that girl

I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm
I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm hmm

Gonna stand up
And I'm gonna matter
'Cause I've had enough of my dreams being shattered
And I've had enough of my tears being splattered
I've already been that girl

Country,Dolly Parton,1982,Heartbreak Express,Do I Ever Cross Your Mind,"Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that?
Or do I ever cross your mind?

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, tell me darling
Or do I ever cross your mind

Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that?
Or do I ever cross your mind?"

Country,Dolly Parton,2001,Little Sparrow,Little Sparrow,"Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

All you maidens heed my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

If I were a little sparrow
Over these mountains I would fly
I would find him, I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All you maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend

Country,Dolly Parton,2018,Dumplin’ (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Red Shoes,"I remember as a child
I was absolutely wild
'Bout some red shoes that my aunt Lucy wore
She would let me stomp around
In those high heels up and down
'Round the house and 'round the wraparound porch

And from that moment on
I've had a pair of my own
They make me feel at home and brand new
They build my confidence
As if they've been heaven sent
I feel alone, I'm puttin' on my red shoes

I begged mama, ""Pretty please
From the wishbook order me
A pair of red shoes for my feet"", so mama did
Through the years I've thought about
Aunt Lucy's love and think of how
Such little things in life can make or break a kid

I believe that every child
Needs to feel a sense of pride
And someone to love and guide and see them through
So many miles I've traveled
Many times they've come unraveled
On the road both smooth or gravel
But I've made it through, ooh

Hell and half of Georgia
Or walkin' through New Orleans
Walk the streets of Memphis bowlin'
Stroll around a block or two
And if God sees fit to hold me
Anyone that's ever known me
Know I'd walk the gold streets only
In a pair of red shoes

And if I ever get to heaven
If I ever get to heaven
If I ever get to heaven
And Lord I hope I do
I will walk the streets of glory
I will walk the streets of glory
I will tell my Lucy story
And walk with her in red shoes"

She has seen and done it all
She's a woman
She knows how to dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies

A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her round and round
You can keep her in your vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies

Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies

She's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Oh, bless her, Lord

Country,Dolly Parton,1971,Joshua,Joshua,"Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-going to go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
Because somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping around my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua

Joshua Joshua
What you are doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Have you got nobody to call your own
No no no no

We talked till the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua

I looked into the mirror at a strange face
Then I looked for you, but you could not be found
And then I felt the lonely coming down

I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely coming down

Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely coming down

I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And again I felt the lonely coming down

If you will just replace the missing parts
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did

You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I will guarantee you'll be completely satisfied
Take these old used memories from the past
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore

Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a-knockin'
I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, ""my name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, its name is little Andy""
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said
""Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?
Patty cake and bakersman, my mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you?""
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night?
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London Bridge is falling down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
We wondered if you'd let us stay with you?
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone
""Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?"""

Country,Dolly Parton,1991,Eagle When She Flies,Silver and Gold,"Well, I met an old man walking down the street
His clothes were torn and tattered with sandals on his feet
And I stopped to help him and lend him a hand
He said, I love you so much, but you must understand

Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world, they won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

And he said to me, let's rest for awhile
For I have some good news to share with you, child
He said, you can't change this old world
The people need to know that a dear savior died here
A long, long time ago

And silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world, they won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

His eyes shown like diamonds and his smile was heaven sent
His hair was long and flowing and his back was slightly bent
And I knew he knew it, 'cause that day I changed
As I watched him walk on, I forgot to get his name

He said silver and gold can't buy you a home
When this life has ended and your time has gone
But you can live in a world where you never grow old
And things can't be bought there with silver and gold
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold"

And you always try to do your best
And just pray for God to do the rest

Some are addicts, drunks, and strays
But not a one is turned away when it's family
Some are lucky, others ain't
Some are fighters, others faint

And when it's family, you trust them
And your heart's an open door
When it's family
You tolerate what you'd kill others for
When it's family, you love and hate and take
Then give some more
Somehow you justify mistakes
Try to find some better way
To solve the problems day to day
In the family

You take the trouble as it comes
And love 'em more than anyone
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family
You choose your lovers
You pick your friends
But not the family that you're in, no
They'll be with you 'til the end
'Cause it's family

When it's family, you forgive them
For they know not what they do
When it's family
They're a mirror of the worst and best in you
When it's family

To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God how great Thou art

Then sings my soul"
Country,Dolly Parton,2014,Blue Smoke,If I Had Wings,"If I had wings I would fly away from
All my troubles, all my thing
And I would fly to a place of comfort
Heaven knows I need a change
If I had wings, Lord give me wings
Oh, I've had my share
Walked alone, alone to road
I could use a new tomorrow
If I had wings I'd make it so
One cannot predict the future
One cannot undo the past
But we can make the present useful
Build the future that will last
If I had wings I'd fly away from
All of my troubles, all of my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go home
If I had wings, Lord give me wings
If I had wings I'd fly away from
All of my troubles, all of my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go home
If I had wings, Lord give me wings
If I had wings, oh, if I had wings
If I had wings, oh Lord, just give me wings
If I had wings, if had wings I'd make a change
If I had wings, if I had wings
If I had wings, if I had wings"
Country,Dolly Parton,1990,Home For Christmas,Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,"Hey kids, now I know you all know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?
(Rudolph) that's right Rudolph
He was the one with the big red nose that everyone make fun of
Everyone there is except Santa

Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, why you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They'd never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Until one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say
""Hey Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history


Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say
""Hey Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history

Now did you kids know that God sees us the way that Santa saw Rudolph?
He sees the true beauty and knows the great potential in each and every one of us
And that's how we should look at each other, through the eyes of love
After all, that's what Christmas is all about, love
Come on, sign along with me

Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, why you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They'd never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say
""Hey Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history

Yay, Rudolph
That's was good!

I'm his girl. Franklin and Rosalind Hart. Frank and Roz Hart...
Perhaps I don't look liek some red hot mama
But believe me that's just what I am
Inside there's a fire mixed with passion and drama
Feelings backed up like a dam
And if I ever turn loose, I'll tell you the truth
Dear Hart, you won't be quite the same
And if I ever get my hands on you
I guarantee you'll be screaming my name!
Heart to hart, eye to eye
Lip to lip, hip to thigh
Tit to toe, and I'll know what to do
I'll put on some music, take off my clothes
Let down my hair, and put on a show
And I'll open some wine and I'll close all the doors
Cupid's dart through my heart says I'm yours
I'll use my love as my magic wand
On the women who clutter your wold
And I'll zap them aside 'Cause I truly despise
How they treat you, but I am your girl
They just don't understand what a wonderful man
I've come to know you to be
And I've got a feelin'
That deep down inside
You might just feel the same about me
Heart to Hart, here we are
I can tell by the stars
In my eyes I'm in sheer paradise
I'm in love, I'm in heat, I'm not being discreet
No it's not ladylike
But I won't miss a beat
Till you're under my speell and surrender to me
Heart to Hart, you are my destiny!
You are my destiny!

Heart to Hart
You're my destiny!

I'll be there

And let me tell you something else!
I will always be your girl
You know I'll always care!
Heart to Hart
You and I
Just like I fantasize
Like the lovers in books and on screen
You're my handsome prince
Come to sweep me away
Out into the sunset to love me always
And you're my Romeo and I'm your Juliet
Come hither to my waiting breast
Here I am, lay me down
And let's go a few rounds
You and me happily, My prince

The end!

Country,Willie Nelson,2001,Rainbow Connection,I’m My Own Grandpa,"Now, many many years ago
When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grown-up daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
Because she was my father's wife
To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter
Who, of course, was my step-mother

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

My father's wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue
Because, she is my wife
She's my grandmother too

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

Now, if my wife is my grandmother
Then, I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild
For now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw
As the husband of my grandmother
I am my own grandpa

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa"
Country,Willie Nelson,1984,Half Nelson,Seven Spanish Angels,"He looked down into her brown eyes
And said ""Say a prayer for me""
She threw her arms around him
Whispered ""God will keep us free""
They could hear the riders coming
He said ""This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, ""Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

There were seven Spanish angels
At the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped
And the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

Come on Willie, help me with this thing

There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun (Oh I believe)
They were praying for the lovers (Yeah they was)
In the Valley of the Gun (Well, well, well)
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne (Oh, yeah)
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home"
Country,Willie Nelson,1975,Red Headed Stranger,Red Headed Stranger,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life?
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

""Don't cross him, don't boss him
""He's wild in his sorrow
""He's riding and hiding his pain
""Don't fight him, don't spite him
""Just wait 'til tomorrow
""Maybe he'll ride on again""

The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again"

We used to both sit on the fence

It'll keep the faith through the long dark night
It takes a woman's love, a woman's love to see the light
It'll make you fly or sink you like a stone
It'll leave you high or leave you all alone
If you believe her word no matter what you've heard
Anybody say about it, there's no life for you without it now
It'll make you fly or sink you like a stone

If you believe her word no matter what you've heard
Anybody say about it, there's no life for you without it now

Is a woman's love, this woman's love and nothing more
It's a woman love you're living for"

Was to have you walk out on me

Last night you came home late
And I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, ""It don't matter
Because it's the holiday season""
And you fill such a big empty space
But then I laid down beside you
And I wanted your loving
Because your love makes my life complete

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

So excuse me for looking
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for living
And being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

True love, you're still my friend
The whole damn thing is over
And we reach our journey's end
I'll leave this world believing
True love, you're still my friend
The road was always rocky
Trouble waitin' 'round every bend
I'll go to hell believing
True love, you're still my friend
You taught me how to twist and turn
And bend before I break
And fake it till I make it
All for true love's sake
You're worth all the heartaches
And I'd do it all again
I'll leave this world believing
True love, you're still my friend
When the whole damn thing is over
Never to be again
I'll go to hell believing
True love, you're still my friend
I can't escape this prison
This cell I'm living in
Where memories guard the inmates
And true love, you're still my friend"
Country,Willie Nelson,1975,Red Headed Stranger,Time of The Preacher Theme,"But he could not forgive her
Though he tried and tried and tried
And the halls of his memory
Still echo her lies
And he cried like a baby
And he screamed like a panther in the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
And he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the lesson is over
And the killin's begun"
Country,Willie Nelson,2018,Last Man Standing,Bad Breath,"Don't ever complain about nothin'
Before we can walk we all gotta crawl
Halitosis is a word I never could spell
But bad breath is better than no breath at all

It's okay to say ""Hello"" to me
But don't get too near if you don't wanna fall
And don't think you'll love me if my breath melts the wall
'Cause bad breath is better than no breath at all

I've been a-puffin' on this and a-suckin' on that
I got feelin' a thousand feet tall
The closer we get, you'll have to agree
That bad breath is better than no breath at all

I been talkin' to the man in the mirror
And he smells his diet is rot-gut alcohol
But it's better I guess than starvin' to death
And bad breath is better than no breath at all

I've been a-puffin' on this and a-suckin' on that
I'm feelin' a thousand feet tall
The closer we get, you'll have to agree
That bad breath is better than no breath at all
Yeah, bad breath is better than no breath at all"
Country,Garth Brooks,1990,No Fences,The Thunder Rolls,"Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, ""He won't do this again""
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls"
Country,Garth Brooks,1993,The Chase,That Summer,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night"

Country,Garth Brooks,1992,Ropin’ the Wind,Papa Loved Mama,"Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama’s in the graveyard, Papa’s in the pen

Well it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town

Well the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shiftin' gears

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama’s in the graveyard, Papa’s in the pen"

And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles, callin' Baton Rouge

A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two, erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change, callin' Baton Rouge

Operator won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up won't you put her on the line

Just an ordinary man
When I close my eyes I see, the way this world shall be

When the last child cries, for a crust of bread
When the last man dies, for just words that he said
When there's shelter over, the poorest head

When the last thing we notice, is the color of skin
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within
When the skies and the oceans are clean again
Then we shall be free

We shall be free

I'll do anything you want me to, I'll do anything at all
And I'm standin', here for all the world to see
Oh, baby that's what's left of me, don't have very far to fall

You know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless, oh, honey I don't have a prayer
Everytime I see you standin' there, I go down upon my knees
And I'm changin', swore I'd never compromise
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise, I'll do anything you please

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist what I couldn't turn down
I can walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you

I have never let anything have this much control over me
I work too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse, I've never had so much to lose

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands

I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow, so I gotta let it go
Oh, I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be

Country,Garth Brooks,1991,Ropin’ the Wind,In Lonesome Dove,"She was a girl on a wagon train
Headed west across the plains
The train got lost in a summer storm
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train
And she looked down and her heart was gone
The train went west but she stayed on
In Lonesome Dove

A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand
A blooming rose in a bed of sand
She loved the man who wore a star
A Texas Ranger known near and far
So they got married and they had a child
But times were tough and the west was wild
So it was no surprise the day she learned
That her Texas man would not return
To Lonesome Dove

Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights

In Lonesome Dove
Lonesome Dove

She watched her boy grow into a man
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand
He wore his star for all to see
He was a Texas lawman legacy
The one day word blew into town
It seemed the men that shot his father down
Had robbed a bank in Cherico
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico
Was Lonesome Dove

The shadows stretched across the land
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street
The men lay at the ranger's feet
But legend tells to this very day (Legend tells to this very day)
That shots were comin' from an alleyway
Though no one knows who held the gun
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone
In Lonesome Dove

Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights

And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone

Oh, she's every woman that I've ever known

She's so New York and then L.A, and every town along the way
And she's every place that I've never been
She's makin' love on rainy nights, she's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I wanna do again

And it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
For when it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence


No, it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

She's anything but typical, she's so unpredictable

That spins my head around
Takes me back, makes me wonder
What's she doin' now?

'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows, what she's doin' now

Just for laughs, I dialed her old number
But no one knew her name
Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered
If she'd ever done the same
I took a walk in the evenin' wind
To clear my head somehow
But tonight, I lie here thinkin'
What's she doin' now?

'Cause what she's doin' now, is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind, and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows...

And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
It's no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love


The storms are ragin' on the rollin' sea
Down on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowin' wild and free

Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my... love"

In his eyes on his helmet he had no fear
Down by a six ball on the ten
Said huddle up boys we’ve got a game to win
Snapped the ball
He looked left and right
Nobody was open so he tucked in tight
And with four of them boys hanging on to him
The clock ran out as he ran it in
And the whole town cheers
And his mama cried
And they rushed down field
And they raised him high
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read All American Hometown Kid
He was recruited by the best schools in the land
He decided he’d sign with his Uncle Sam
He kissed mama goodbye in their living room
Said dad don’t worry I’ll be home soon
And the whole town cheers
And his mama cried
And they lined the street
Just to say goodbye
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read Come Back All American Hometown Kid

Three tours of duty
And a silver star
Brought him back home with his battle scars
He stepped off the plane
In his combat boots
He saluted the red white and blue

And his mama cried
Another hometown boy made it home alive
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read Welcome Back Home All American Kid
Yeah, this song is for those who never did come back all American kids"

We can hear their horses breathing
As in silence we draw near

The snow is piled high, on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea, on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored, somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her, instead of huggin', this old cold shoulder

This old highway, is like a woman sometimes
She can be your best friend, but she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me, to the life I dream of
And she's the mistress that keeps me, from the ones that I love

And I'll never know the reason why I always run away

Burning bridges, one by one
What I'm doin' can't be undone
And I'm always hopin' someday
I'm gonna stop this runnin' 'round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Last night we talked of old times, families and hometowns
She wondered if we'd both agree on where we'd settle down
And I told her that we'd cross that bridge whenever it arrived
Now through the flames I see her standin' on the other side

Burning bridges, one by one
What I'm doin', can't be undone
And I'm always hopin' someday
I'm gonna stop this runnin' 'round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Like ashes on the water I drift away in sorrow
Knowing that the day my lesson's finally learned
I'll be standin' at a river, starin' out across tomorrow
And the bridge I need to get there will be a bridge that I have burned

Burning bridges, one by one
What I'm doin', can't be undone
And I'm always hopin' someday
I'm gonna stop this runnin' 'round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Another bridge goes down"
Country,Garth Brooks,1993,In Pieces,The Cowboy Song,"Pushin' horns weren't easy like the movie said it was
And I don't recall no dance hall girls or hotel rooms with rugs
You worked hot and tired and nasty, rode your pony's head too low
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep 'cause it was too damn cold
And you'd sing ""Strawberry Roan"" and ""Little Joe""

Like the time we hit the river and the rains began to fall
And the water was risin' so damn fast we thought it'd drown us all
We lost a lot of steers that day and four to five good mounts
But when all the boys rode into camp, we knew that's what counts
And we sang, yippee ti yi yay and ""Amazing Grace""

Or the night they broke behind us and then took us by surprise
I whistled out to Bonner I seen the terror in his eyes
And he rode for all his horse would ride and I know he done his best
But he crossed over Jordan ridin' Donny to his death
And we sang ""Bringing in the Sheaves"" and ""The Rugged Cross""

So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice
He never meant to bow them legs or put that gravel in his voice
He's just chasin' what he really loves and what's burnin' in his soul
Wishin' to God that he'd been born a hundred years ago
Still singin', ""Strawberry Roan"" and ""Little Joe"""
Country,Garth Brooks,1992,The Chase,Dixie Chicken,"I seen the bright lights of Memphis
And the Commodore Hotel
And it was there beneath the streetlamp
Where I met a southern belle
Well she took me to the river
Where she cast her spell
And it was 'neath that Memphis moonlight
She sang this song so well

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
Hey, I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland

We hit all the hotspots
Hey, my money flowed like wine
'Til the lowdown southern whiskey
Began to fog my mind
Well, I don't remember church bells
Or the money I put down
On the white picket fence and boardwalk
At the house on the edge of town
Now, but boy do I remember
The strain of her refrain
And the nights we spent together
And the way she called my name

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
Hey, I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland


It's been a year since she ran away
Guess that guitar player sure could play
She always liked to sing along
He was always handy with a song
Then one night in the lobby
Of the Commodore Hotel
I by chance met a bartender
Who said he knew her well
And as he handed me a drink
He began to hum a song
And all the boys there at the bar
Began to sing along

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland"
Country,Garth Brooks,2001,Scarecrow,The Storm,"She sits among the pieces
Of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases
The last... of what was her past
It struck without a warning
Or did she just ignore the signs
In those dark clouds forming
Behind... her silver lines

And the door it slammed like thunder
And the tears they fell like rain
And the warnings from her family
Whirl like a hurricane
Oh, she's drowning in emotions
And she cannot reach the shore
She's alive
But, can she survive... the storm

A broken jewel box dancer
Lies in pieces down the hall
She's finding out the answers
Don't change, nothing at all
It's time that she stopped searching
For who's to blame or what went wrong
The only thing for certain
Is he's gone, she's gotta move on

Then a door was slammed like thunder
And the tears they fall like rain
And the warnings from her family
Whirl like a hurricane
Oh, she's drowning in emotions
And she cannot reach the shore
She's alive
But, can she survive... the storm

Someday days just roll on by
Without a gray cloud in the sky
She keeps telling herself
""I... will make it on my own""
And her friends
They've all gone back to their lives
Thinking she will be alright
As she races through the night, to make it home

And the door it slams like thunder
And the tears they fall like rain
And the warnings from her family
Whirl like a hurricane
Oh, she's drowning in emotions
And she cannot reach the shore
She's alive
But, can she survive... the storm

She sits among the pieces
Of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases
The last... of what was her past"

And the good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad times
Or the bad things he's done, lord
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man

He likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over, she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him
But she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman
She loves her good timin' man

Country,Waylon Jennings,1977,Ol’ Waylon,Till I Gain Control Again,"Just like the sun over the mountain top
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time
Like sunlight dancing on your skin
And I have never gone so wrong as for telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing that I can hide from you
You see me better than I can

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again

Just like a lighthouse you must stand alone
And mark the sailor's journey's end
No matter what sea I've been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again"
Country,Waylon Jennings,1976,Wanted! The Outlaws,My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,"I grew up dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
Lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days
I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well your best days are gone
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, an 'old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams"
Country,Waylon Jennings,1977,Ol’ Waylon,Belle Of The Ball,"A vagabond dreamer, a rhymer and singer of songs
Singing to no one and nowhere to really belong
I met a beautiful lady, a pure Southern belle of the ball
Like Scarlet O'Hara loved no one and wanted them all

I'll never forget you and love you inspite of your faults
The good and the bad I want to remember it all
I did a new dance and you did your Tennessee Waltz
The party's all over I came uninvited
I'm leaving and taking the belle of the ball

There will always be someone I guess that's the way it should be
I guess i should know that someone used to be me
They'll gather around her soon they'll all look the same
At the feet of the lady are lover's without any names"

Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love

I was willing but she wasn't ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new

Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

Country,Alan Jackson,1992,Don’t Rock The Jukebox,Midnight In Montgomery,"Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there?

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air

So he started drinkin', took some things that messed up his thinkin'
He was sure sinkin', when she came along
He was alone in the spot light, not too much left in sight
She changed all that one night, when she sang him this song

Hey, baby, I love you, hey, baby, I need you
Hey, baby, you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life, runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine a little love light, down on that blues man

He got so sick from speedin', all the things they said he was needin'
If he is to keep on pleasin', all of his fans
He got cuffed on dirt roads, he got sued over no shows
She came and took all that ol' load, down off that blues man
And he said...

Hey, baby, I love you too, hey, baby, I need you
Hey, baby, I do get tired, of this travellin' band
I'm over 40 years old now, nights would be cold now

Raised on the ways and gentle kindness

Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man

Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless are they white as snow?

That's the way it's got to be
With this love we can live, we can't keep it to ourselves
He is mine, he is yours
And we can live our lives in telling
I give my heart, I give my soul, I give you all my worldly goods
Two in one, one in two
That's the way it's got to be
I will cling to you, you will cling to me
And in the shadow of the cross we'll live on bended knee
With this prayer I commit that we both become as one
He in us and we in Him
Saying vows to one another
Hold them fast in your heart till the day we see the Son
Two in one, one in two
That's the way it's got to be
I will cling to you, you will cling to me
And in the shadow of the cross we'll live on bended knee
With this prayer I commit that we both become as one
He in us and we in Him
Saying vows to one another
Hold them fast in your heart till the day we see the Son
Two in one, one in two
That's the way it's got to be

Country,Alan Jackson,1996,Here In The Real World,Home,"In small town down in Georgia
Over 40 years ago
Her maiden name was Musik
'Til she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
But they believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same

And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying days
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in a bind

And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

My mama raised five children
Four girls, and there was me
She found her strength and faith in God
And a love of family
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
To pay a bill or two

My daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
And folks drove their cars from miles around
To let them look underneath the hood

And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

There'll never be another place in this world
That I'll call home"

Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred past unfolds

Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears


I remember Mother praying
Father too, on bended knee
The sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me


Precious memories fill my soul"
Country,Alan Jackson,2015,Angels & Alcohol,Angels and Alcohol,"You can't mix Angels and Alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
When it takes control you can't love no one at all
You can't mix Angels and Alcohol
You can't blend whiskey with a good women's love
They don't go together, loves already hard enough
You think you can handle how it feels or what it does
You can't blend whiskey with a good women's love
You can't chase lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short piece of time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't chase lonely with a bottle of wine
You can't mix Angels and Alcohol
An angel once loved me and I traded it all
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
You can't mix Angels and Alcohol"

Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

When Christ shall come
With shouts of adulation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim My God
How great Thou art


How great Thou art
How great Thou art"

While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear

And He walks with me

And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own

None other has ever known

I'd stay in the garden with Him
'Tho the night around me is falling
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling


And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known"
Country,Alan Jackson,2015,Angels & Alcohol,You Can Always Come Home,"Spread your wings, don't be afraid to try
The world can be hard, you gotta live a little 'fore you die
So open that door, step out in the bright sunshine
Follow your heart, and remember any time

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

So pack your bags, smile and say goodbye
And chase those dreams, and when you lay down and die
You know that there's someone praying for you every day
Even if you never find your way

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

When I was young, my daddy said to me
The very same words and I took those words with me
When I was afraid, I'd pull them out and think
Just how much they mean to me

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home"
Country,Alan Jackson,2009,Good Time,Sissy’s Song,"Why did she have to go
So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason, without rhyme
Lovely, sweet young woman
Daughter, wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

Loved ones she left behind
Just tryin' to survive
And understand the why
Feelin' so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then askin' for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hopin' that maybe

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

It's hard to say goodbye
Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times I'll cherish
And I won't cry 'cause

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

Don't worry 'bout me

Of Jesus and his glory
Of Jesus and his love
I love to tell the story

It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do

I love to tell the story
'twill be my theme in glory
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love

I love to tell the story
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest
And when, in scenes of glory
I sing the new, new song
'twill be the old, old story
That I have loved so long"

I think you'll understand why

Tonight
I'm the designated drinker
I just lost
The one who wrapped me around her finger
I need to get
To where I can't think of her
So tonight
I'm the designated drinker

I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you

I may hate myself tomorrow

Country,Alan Jackson,2015,Genuine - The Alan Jackson Story,If Tears Could Talk,"I've watched you hide the pain too many times
Much too often you don't say what's in your heart
But you don't have to say it's over, I can see it in your eyes
'Cause if tears could talk, you just said goodbye
Without a word, you took our picture from the wall
And your dresses from the closet down the hall
When I tried to talk it over, you just turned away and cried
But if tears could talk, you just said goodbye
And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died
And if tears could talk, you just said goodbye
And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died
And if tears could talk, you just said goodbye
Oh if tears could talk, you just said goodbye"
Country,Alan Jackson,1999,High Mileage,Little Man,"I remember walkin' 'round the court square sidewalks
Looking in windows at things I couldn't want
There's Johnson's Hardware and Morgan's Jewelry
And the old Lee King's Apothecary
They were the little man
The little man

I go back now and the stores are empty
Except for an old Coke sign dated 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
About the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut them down
And killed the little man
Oh, the little man

He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget the little man
Forget about that little man
He hung on there for a few more years
But he couldn't sell Slurpees
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a man down the road
And they sell Velvet Elvis and
Second-hand clothes
There goes little man
There goes another little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
About the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut them down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the whole world in just one trip
And save a penny because it's jumbo size
They don't even realize
They're killing the little man
Oh the little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
About the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut them down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

It wasn't long ago when I was a child
An old black man came with his mule and his plow
He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Back before we'd all forgotten
About the little man
The little man
Long live the little man
God bless the little man"

I just got time for one more round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone;
And you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile, and did a while; but it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear drops streaming down his face?

Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

Home for me, is misery, and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me. It's not what I perfer
So, it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her

Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

Sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers ""There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?""

Sing me back home, the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die "

About the way they have to live here in this country

And griping 'bout the way things ought to be
And I don't mind them switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
But when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me

They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss
You're walking on the fighting side of me

I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims that he just don't believe in fighting
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
When they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me

They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep

Got to come down again
When the world wide war is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
When they find out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun come shining through

We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

You don't have to get high to be happy
Just think about what's in store
When people start doing what they oughta to be doing
They won't be booing no more
When a president goes through the white house doors
And does what he says he'll do"

When you left home you told me that someday you'd be returning
With a fancy car for a whole town to see
Well now everybody's watching now and i guess you finally got your dream

You're riding in one of them long black limousines

Through tears i watch as you ride by
With a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another for my heart and all my dreams

Ride with you in that long black limousine..."
Country,Merle Haggard,1985,For the Record: 43 Legendary Hits,Kern River,"I'll never swim Kern River again
It was there that I met her
It was there that I lost my best friend
And now I live in the mountains
I drifted up here with the wind
And I may drown in still water
But I'll never swim Kern River again
I grew up in an oil town
But my gusher never came in
And the river was a boundary
Where my darlin' and I used to swim
One night in the moonlight
The swiftness swept her life away
And now I live on Lake Shasta and
Lake Shasta is where I will stay
There's the South San Joaquin
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found
And there's a place called Mount Whitney
From where the mighty Kern River comes down
Well, it's not deep nor wide
But it's a mean piece of water my friend
And I may cross on the highway
But I'll never swim Kern River again"

But I've been a workin' man dang near all my life

Might get a little tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay
But I'll go back workin'
Come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew
I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these workin' man blues
Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin around
I wanna throw my bills out the window
Catch a train to another town
But I go back workin'
I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
I drink a little beer in a tavern
Cry a little bit of these working man blues

Hey hey, the working man, the working man like me
I ain't never been on welfare, that's one place I won't be
Cause I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
I drink a little beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues"

I'm unhappy without her

And sing it for me"

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

As helpless as a falling leave
You gave your hand to me that day
And you did it, because you're made that way

You love me and you let me know
Darling just remember these three words
I love you 

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly"

In this little country chapel that's almost falling down
There'll be tears in this old farmer's eyes this evening
When I give my one possession to that city boy from town
His hair is a little longer than we're use to
But, I guess I should find something good to say
About this man who's won the farmer's daughter
And will soon become my son-in-law today
Mama left eight years ago December
And it was hard to be a Dad and Mama too
But, somehow we made home of this old farmhouse
And love was all my baby ever knew
He could be the richest man in seven counties
And not be good enough to take her hand
But, he says he really loves the farmer's daughter
And I know the farmer's daughter loves the man"

Memories that make my heart grow cold
But some day we'll live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
Your lips that used to thrill me so
Your kisses were meant for only me
In my dreams we'll live them all again
But my golden moon is just a memory

When my blue moon turns to gold again
And the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

The castle we built of dreams together
Was the sweetest stories ever told
You know maybe we could live them all again
Dark blue moon again will turn to gold"

That looks like Elvis

I cleared us off a place on that
One little table that you left us
And pulled me up a big ole piece of floor
I pulled the head off Elvis
Filled Fred up to his pelvis
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you
'Round about ten we all got to talking
'Bout Graceland, Bedrock and such
The conversation finally turned to women
But they said they didn't get around too much
Elvis said, ""Find 'em young.""
And Fred said, ""Old Fashioned girls are fun.""
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you
Later on it finally hit me
That you wouldn't be 'a comin' home no more
Cause this time I know you won't forgive me
Like all of them other times before
Then I broke Elvis's nose
Pouring the last drop from his toes
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone

He reaches out his hand and without a word
As his fingers softly fall upon my face

Cause if you're looking at me
You're looking at country

You don't see no city when you look at me
Cause country's all I am

This here country is a little green
And there's a lotta country that you ain't seen

Country,Reba McEntire,1991,Rumor Has It,Fancy,"I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl
Across the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking mama, ""What do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you""

She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your mama's gonna move you uptown

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama had been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was going to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might've been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""

It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea in a five room hotel suite (Yes, she was)
I charmed a king, congressman and an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry about nothing
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringing in my ears

""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
""Oh, here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down, honey
Mama's gonna move you uptown
And I guess she did"

And on those lonely nights
I could think of them once more
Keep your words alive inside my head

You were the one who always stood beside me
So unaware I foolishly believed
That you would always be there
But then there came a day
And I turned my head and you slipped away
If I had only known
It was my last night by your side
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn
And when you'd smile at me

Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie
The heart won't lie"
Country,Reba McEntire,2019,Stronger Than the Truth,Tammy Wynette Kind of Pain,"This ain't a little mascara running down my cheek
And this ain’t a little scratch that'll heal in a couple of weeks
This is more than a little smile I'm having to fake
’Cause this ain't no little girl heartache

Standing by your man
That's a broken plan
When he breaks your heart and all your trust
With his two cheating hands
So it's D-I-V-O-R-C-E
And you don't want him to see you crying
So you're crying in the rain
And this is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette kind of pain

There's a sky full of tears and every single note
And every single word is wine and whiskey-soaked
So I guess it’s me and her, together in this all along
’Til I can make it on my own

Standing by your man
That's a broken plan
When he breaks your heart and all your trust
With his two cheating hands
So it’s D-I-V-O-R-C-E
And you don't want him to see you crying
So you're crying in the rain
And this is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette kind of pain

Standing by your man
Well that’s a broken plan
When he breaks your heart and all your trust
With his two cheating hands
And it's D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Means this golden wedding ring
Don't mean a thing
Oh this is Tammy Wynette
This is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette kind of pain"
Country,Reba McEntire,1992,For My Broken Heart,Is There Life Out There,"She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready
Now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
But now she's just wondering
What she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering
Is there life out there?

She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how
To live for today
She's dying to try something foolish
Do something crazy
Or just get away
Something for herself for a change


There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then
She looks out the window and wonders again"
Country,Reba McEntire,1994,Read My Mind,Why Haven’t I Heard From You,"Back in 1876 an old boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
As a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""

Well there's no problem getting to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding and call waiting
You can even call collect
The service man he told me that my phone is working fine
And I've come to the conclusion trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""

There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And a thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothing about

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""
So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?

Country,Reba McEntire,2017,Sing It Now: Songs of Faith & Hope,From the Inside Out,"A thousand times I've failed, still your mercy remains
Should I stumble again? Still I'm caught in your grace
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
Your will above all else, my purpose remains
The art of losing myself in bringing you praise
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
My heart and my soul, I give you control
Consume me from the inside out Lord
Let justice and praise, become my embrace
To love you from the inside out
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise
From the inside out, Lord my soul cries out"
Country,Reba McEntire,1986,Whoever’s In New England,Whoever’s In New England,"You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week you've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there
You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart
When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
Cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you
I hear the winter time up north can last forever
I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear
I've packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again
There's just one thing you ought to know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all
When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
Cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you"

Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
I'd drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Because they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I would understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Because I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, oh, to come home

If I were a boy
I think I would understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a - a better man
And I'd listen to her
Because I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Because he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
How it feels to love a girl -
Someday you'll wish you were a - a better man

And I swear not to give up on you
I swear that I'll always be your truth
I swear to bring you light in the darkest nights

Come, we will always be loved
It's scary, it's freeing, it's twirling in meaning
It's hiding from all you can and can't see
Romance and love, romance and love

Two roads approaching, which way do we turn?
Doesn't much matter cause we've lived and let go and we've learned
Without the map, it's just you and me
Leading each other in a world that'll always believe

She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that

Country,Reba McEntire,2004,Room To Breathe ,He Gets That From Me,"His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do

He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me

His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat

Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me

He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do

He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you

How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me

He gets that from you
He gets that from you

Last night I heard him pray
""Lord, help me and Momma make it through
And tell Daddy we'll be okay""

He said he sure misses you
He sure misses you
He really misses you
He gets that from me"
Country,Reba McEntire,2019,Stronger Than the Truth,The Clown,"After a couple of bottle of red wine, the truth finally came out
The words ""I don't love you anymore"" spilled from his mouth
So I looked to the waiter for some consolation
But he just poured the coffee, and without hesitation
He said, ""Ma'am, is that all you'll be needing tonight?""

And oh, the piano kept playing
And nobody noticed the heart in the corner booth breaking
Cell phones kept ringin', glasses were clinkin'
Everyone laughin' and dancin' and singin'
So I painted a smile on my face to cover the frown
In that room full of jokers and jesters, I was the clown

Well, you can't walk the high wire of love and be afraid to fall
And you can't put all of your faith in a gypsy's crystal ball
We just do what we do, take the chances we take
Show me a life without a mistake
Oh, we all learn our lessons and we all fall down

And oh, the piano keeps playing
And nobody notices the heart in the corner booth breaking
Cell phones keep ringin', glasses keep clinkin'
Everyone laughin' and dancin' and singin'
So if you paint a big smile on your face to cover the frown
In that room full of jokers and jesters, sometimes you're the clown

When the circus is over and the tents are pulled down
The truth is, the show must go on for the clown

And oh, the piano kept playing"

A song's not a song without singing
Chorus:
Love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
Oh love isn't love till you give it away
You might think love is a treasure to keep
Feeling to cherish and hold
But love is a treasure for people to share
You keep it by letting it go

Cause love can't survive
When it's hidden inside
And love was meant to be shared

Or rhymin' to the rhythm of the blues
Been gettin' on the times
Of leaving in the past what I can't undo
So throw your hat back in the ring
And baby, I'll swing all night long with you

Well it's sure been a while
Since a cowboy made me smile the way you do
I've been fallin' for the same old lies
And dancin' to the same old tunes
If you don't mind movin' slow, I'll give it a go
Hey, what's there to lose?
Could be more than just a fling
So baby, I'll swing all night long with you

Let's let those doggone bygones be long gone
And we'll find a new song to two-step to
If you wanna take another swing at love
Baby, I'll swing all night long with you


Let's let those doggone bygones be long gone

Country,Reba McEntire,2019,Stronger Than the Truth,Cactus in a Coffee Can,"She had the window and I had the aisle
She looked 25, but she was shaking like a child when we took off
I looked over and clutched in her hand
There was a cactus in a coffee can
She was holding that thing like it was all that she had
She smiled at me, but I could tell she was sad

Somewhere over Denver, I asked her her name
She said ""Elena,"" and told me she came from Santa Fe
She ordered a drink and a wall came down
She started talking and pain poured out
She told me a story I'll never forget
She had me in tears when she looked at me and said

""My mama's first love was crack
She made her living lying on her back
And she gave me away on the day that I was born""

She said, ""The last ten years I spent tracking her down
It don't seem fair that when I finally found her she was almost gone
We had two weeks together to laugh and to cry
Two weeks to say hello and goodbye
She gave me this cactus, said, 'It's kinda like me
It'll hurt you to hold it, but it blooms every spring'""

She said, ""I'm on my way back to New Mexico
Was gonna scatter these ashes where the desert winds blow
But I came up with a better plan
I'm gonna keep 'em in the bottom of this coffee can""

""My mama was a tortured soul
I still love her even though
Oh, she gave me away on the day I was born""

The plane touched down and we both got off
I took her hand and said, ""I'm sorry for your loss""
She said, ""Thanks for listening, and for being here
I've been wantin' to talk about for so many years""
Now I'll probably never see Elena again
We met as strangers and parted as friends
As we waved goodbye, I was sure of one thing
There'll be a flower on that cactus come next spring"

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray

Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Country,Carrie Underwood,2016,Storyteller,Church Bells,"Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'"

Wondering how the glow with that porch light hasn't gone out
'Cause it's been on now for three days straight
He’s been nowhere to be found
Probably drowning in the neon, where the wagon broke down
She called up his mama and his friends in town
But they ain't seen him
Another night of no sleepin'

Round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
She's all cried out on the kitchen floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

He's in a hotel room with the TV on
Gettin' lost in the static with the curtains drawn
Knowin' this could be the time that gets her gone for good
He'd quit if he could
But one down, two down, three down, four
Can't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore

Oh, 'round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows

She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail

Deep down inside we wanna believe they still do
In our secretest heart, it's our favorite part of the story
Let's just admit we all wanna make it too

Ever ever after
If we just don't get it our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be a wish away

Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve
Sometimes you reach what's real just by making believe
Unafraid, unashamed
There is a joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you

Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after

No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through

To ever ever after
Forever could even start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just one wish away
Your ever ever after

What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by
Moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand

I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive

My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

Don't think I'm lyin' 'round, cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really alright
I've never looked back — as a matter of fact

And hear on CNN that Elvis lives again
And that John's back with the Beatles and they're going out on tour
I'll be the first in line for tickets
Gotta see that show for sure

Or the laughter you'll forgo
Until you've lost that one love
Then you'll know

Now you pretend to care for me
But honey, if you do
Why don't you give the kind of kiss
I always give to you
So, I've just made my mind up
Even thou my tears will flow
Go on and find a new love
Then you'll know

Then you'll know"
Country,Patsy Cline,1958,25 All Time Greatest Recordings,Dear God,"I go to church on a Sunday
The vows that I make
I break them on Monday
The rest of the week
I do as I please
Then come Sunday morning
I pray on my knees

Dear God
I know I'm not worthy
But I need you so
Please won't you hurry
And help me turn back from
The path I have trod
You'll never be sorry
Dear God

Each day we read in the paper
Of the carryin's on
Of some of our neighbors
We're sinnin', and lyin'
And forgetting the faith
Then we have the nerve
To ask is it too late?

Dear God

But I need you so
Please won't you hurry
And help me turn back from
The path I have trod
You'll never be sorry

Country,Hank Williams,1949,Moanin’ The Blues,I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry"

Country,Hank Williams,1951,Memorial Album,"Cold, Cold Heart","I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?"

Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack
I love you baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a Ramblin' Man
Some folks might sa-ay that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open ro-oad starts to callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see
Sometimes it's har-rd but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, He made a Ra-amblin' Man
I love to see the towns a-passin' by
And to ride these rails 'neath God's blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
Cause that's the life I believe, He meant for me
And when I'm gone and at my grave, you stand
Just say God's called home your Ramblin' Man"

Country,Hank Williams,1954,I Saw The Light,A House Of Gold,"People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
Don't they know on the judgement day
That their gold and silver will melt away

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

Jesus said, come on to me
I'll break sin's chains and set you free
I'll carry you to a home on high
Where you'll never, never die

What good is gold and silver, too
When your heart's not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Jesus died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Sinner hear now what I say
For someday you'll have to pay

What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not good and true
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray"

She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring

Why don't you mind your own business?

Well, if you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine


If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three
Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me

Just mind your own business

I'm lonesome, and oh, how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill


Do you recall when we parted?
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill


I've waited all through the years, love
To give you a heart true and real

In your loveless mansion on the hill

The light shine bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill"

You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
But dear I hope you're happy just the same
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing out for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bell will never ring for me
I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
I hear the children laughing out with glee
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And while the organ plays I love you truly
Please let me pretend that I am there
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another
But wedding bells will never ring for me"

You're warned of the day
When you'll be laid
Beneath the cold clay
The Angel of Death
Will come from the sky
And claim up your soul
When the time comes to die
When the Angel of Death
Comes down after you
Can you smile and say
That you have been true
Can you truthfully say
With your dying breath
That you're ready to meet
The Angel of Death
When the lights all grow dim
And the dark shadows creep
And then your lived ones
Are gathered to weep
Can you face them and say
With your dying breath
That you're ready to meet
The Angel of Death
When the Angel of Death
Comes down after you
Can you smile and say
That you have been true
Can you truthfully say
With your dying breath
That you're ready to meet
The Angel of Death"
Country,Hank Williams,1953,Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter,Be Careful Of Stones That You Throw,"A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw
A neighbor was passing my garden
One time, she stopped and I knew right away
That it was gossip not flowers she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say
""That bad girl down the street should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to me or my child""
My neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw
A car speeded by and the screaming of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still
The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
""Oh who was that brave girl so sweet?""
I covered the crushed broken body and sad
The bad girl who lived down the street
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw"
Country,Hank Williams,1951,40 Greatest Hits,Dear John,"Well when I woke up this mornin'

Said don't make me no coffee Babe

Daniel in the lion's den
But I know a guy that didn't try to get along
And he won't get a chance again

Well she didn't forward no address
Nor she didn't say goodbye
All she said was if you get blue
Just hang your little head and cry

But if that little old gal of mine

Country,Hank Williams,1954,I Saw The Light,How Can You Refuse Him Now,"How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
There's a story old, that has often been told
Of how our Saviour died, as they nailed His hands
He cried they don't understand
As the blood flowed from His side
How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
As He hung there on the tree, He prayed for you and me
There was no one His pain to ease
Before He died, He faintly cried
Father forgive them please
How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now"
Country,Hank Williams,1953,Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter,Men With Broken Hearts,"You'll meet many just like me upon life's busy street
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low
And eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
You've never walked in that man's shoes
Or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands
While the heart inside you dies
Some were propers some were kings
And some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same
These men with broken hearts
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where he starts
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken hearts"
Country,Kenny Rogers,1979,Kenny,Coward of the County,"Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky"" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man

Everyone considered him the coward of the county"
Country,Kenny Rogers,1981,Share Your Love,Through the Years,"I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years, you've never let me down
You turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found
I've found with you... through the years
I've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed, right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad
To be with you ... through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged
Right here with you... through the years
I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out
I've learned what love's about, by loving you
Through the years

Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found
I've found with you ... through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you

Country,Kenny Rogers,1979,The Gambler,She Believes In Me,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits while she waits for me"
Country,Kenny Rogers,1979,Kenny,You Decorated My Life,"All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shining soft in your eyes
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life"

Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory

Country,Miranda Lambert,2014,Platinum,Gravity Is A Bitch,"You spend your twenties feeling that you're walking on the ceiling and you party like you're eight feet tall
You say working's for the birds, chasing dreams and miniskirts, from here, everything seems small
Then thirties come around and you finally feel the ground
Look around and maybe start planning for what the future holds and though you're far from old
You moisturize and spend less time tanning

You're hanging over but you're hanging in, you're starting to look like all of your friends
Conversations turning from rock and roll to kids and politics and how much money you owe
Got bags under your eyes, bigger hips and bigger thighs, you got places that you can't even itch
You can nip it, tuck it, squeeze it but you're never gonna beat it, 'cause gravity's a bitch
Forty's kinda boring and you spend your time ignoring the things you don't see so clear
Your reflection in the glass is gonna knock you on your ass, you wonder how the hell'd it get down here
You're happy in your fifties though things are kind of shifty, at sixty you'll find peace of mind
Go to bed at eight o'clock, and comb your hair if you've still got it, 'cause you're almost at the finish line

You're hanging over but you're hanging in, you're starting to look like all of your friends

And maybe it's the chase that makes me tick
Girls like me don't mean to, but we don't know better

And one was the one daddy gave me away to

Lived just like a gypsy
Break a heart, roll out of town
'Cause gypsies never get tied down

Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl

Unbridled, or tethered and tied
The safety of the fence
Or the danger of the ride
I'll always be unsatisfied

Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
In a lighthouse with a chandelier
I'd watch everybody's ships come in
And then I'd sail away with them

Unanchored in a storm
Or safety on the shore
If this is all I need
Why do I want more?

Country,Brad Paisley,2013,Wheelhouse,Accidental Racist,"To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view

I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
(Yeah)
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee
But I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride

But I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me
Know what I mean?) It's real, it's real
It's truth"

Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss

Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came

Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what

I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground

And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah I live for little moments like that

I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank god that she isn't cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that

When she's laying on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it cause it's tingling and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I don't want to wake her up
Yeah I live for little moments
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah I live for little moments like that"
Country,Brad Paisley,2012,Wheelhouse,Southern Comfort Zone,"You might be a redneck ...
(radio static)
The Grand Ole Opry coming to you live from ...
(radio static)

When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shockin'
Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans
Not everybody goes to church
Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to
""Ring Of Fire"" or ""Amazing Grace""

Oh, Dixie Land
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me
To take a good hard look around and be a minority

And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White
I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back


I wish I was in Dixie Again
I miss my Tennessee Home
I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

Look away, look away
I wish I was in Dixie, away, look away"
Country,Brad Paisley,2017,Love and War,Gold All Over the Ground (Album),"And ladies and gentlemen
Here's the one I need, the inspiration for it
Miss June Carter
What do you say!

If I had you at my mercy
There's no telling what I'd do
But I'd sit and make you listen
For an hour, maybe two
And then you'd know I need you
Every day that rolls around
And your feet would walk on velvet
With gold all over the ground

You're trails would be downhill
A soft breeze at your back
A sky full of diamonds
And your nights would not be black
Yes, you would really love it
And if you're ever down
I'd give you rows of roses
And gold all over the ground

I'd pick you up and carry you 'cross every stream I see
And I'd bundle you in kindness
Until you cling to me
We'd sit beneath strong branches
My arms would twine around
I'd turn your green to emerald
And give you gold all over the ground

I'd pick you up and carry you 'cross every stream I see
And I'd bundle you in kindness
Until you cling to me
We'd sit beneath strong branches
My arms would twine around
I'd turn your green to emerald
And your skies full diamonds
And give you gold all over the ground

She's not only a lady who I share my life with
But she may have been the person
Responsible for me still being alive
She and God"

Standing there
Young again
Long brown hair
As he crosses over
To the other side
She smiles at him
He runs at her
With arms open wide

She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again

He went down hill
Once she was gone
Lost the will, to carry on
They couldn't find nothing wrong
No matter what they did
But I know the answers in the picture frame that's sitting by his desk

She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again

As the doctors come running
I overhear a nurse say ""were loosin' him""
We've been losing him since he lost her

She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again"

But this is country music and we do

Do you like to drink a cold one on the weekend and get a little loud
Do you want to say I'm sorry or I love you but you don't know how?
Do you wish somebody had the nerve to tell that stupid boss of yours
To shove it next time he yells at you?
Well this is country music and we do

So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Yeah this is country music

Are you haunted by the echo of your mother on the phone
Crying as she tells you that your brother is not coming home?
And if there's anyone that still has pride and the memory of those
That died defending the old red, white, and blue
This is country music and we do

So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Just like a road that takes you home
Yeah this is right where you belong
This is country music

When his parents left town
He told a few people who told a few people
And word got around
It was a legendary evenin'
The whole place got trashed
It took all day Sunday and four of his buddies and twelve Glad bags
They got it all cleaned up, hauled it off in a truck
Before his parents got back
When they got home
He gave them a hug
And almost a heart attack

'Cause there was one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
His daddy threw a fit
And Bobby discovered
There ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can

Bobby had a car
His parents paid for
He'd take it out on dates
And drive it out to the lake
But he don't anymore
Now all of his friends
Are still going out
Not a care in the world
Just thinking about girls
And Bobby sittin' home and thinking about

That one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
That's all it took
You talk about a bummer
Ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can

It could've been worse
But that ain't the point
It could've been a rubber
Or a half-smoked joint
The hardest part is
It was almost fine
They drank a hundred beers
And cleaned up ninety-nine

But there was one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
His daddy had a fit
And Bobby discovered
There ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer

Country,Brad Paisley,2009,American Saturday Night,Welcome to the Future,"When I was ten years old
I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were goin' on an eight hour drive
If I could just watch TV
And I'd have given anything
To have my own PacMan game at home
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade
Now I've got it on my phone

He-e-ey
Glory glory hallelujah
Welcome to the future

My grandpa was in World War II
He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed 'em from his base in the Philippines
I wish they could see this now
The world they say has changed you know
'Cause I was on a video chat this morning
With a company in Tokyo

He-e-ey
Everyday's a revolution
Welcome to the future

He-e-ey
Look around it's all so clear
He-e-ey
Wherever we were going, well we're here
He-e-ey
So many things I never thought I'd see
Happening right in front of me

I had a friend in school
Running-back on a football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the homecoming queen
I thought about him today
And everybody who's seen what he's seen
From a woman on a bus
To a man with a dream

But here we sit tonight
The look in her eyes
Says something’s wrong
This ain't a wild bull
It's just a bar stool
But it’s all I can do
To just hang on

And George Strait's on the jukebox in the corner
Singing 'bout cowboys riding away

But this ain't my first rodeo
Someone's gonna get hurt
Whenever someone says ""We need to talk""
It feels like there's a number
Pinned on to the back of my shirt
'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off
Yeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off

You can go to Houston
Vegas or San Antone
And watch a bull rider
Hit the dirt
Or head down to this bar
For a little cover charge
You can watch me
Get thrown by her

George Strait's on the jukebox again
Says if I leave now I can still make Cheyenne

But this ain’t my first rodeo
Someone’s gonna get hurt
So hey, bartender, give me one more shot
It feels like there's a number
Pinned on to the back of my shirt
’Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off
Yeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off

I think about those nights in Marina Del Rey
As this beautiful cowgirl slips away
But the pain only lasts so long
And when you get bucked off you get back on

It feels like there's a number
Pinned on to the back of my shirt
'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off

Country,Brad Paisley,2014,Moonshine in the Trunk,High Life,"I can still remember when
Grandpa died and our ship came in
Daddy said he left momma and him
More money than they'd ever seen
And just like that we were thousandaires
Had a brand new boat and a Frigidaire
And all us kids in our underwear
Were jumping on a trampoline

A bunch low lives living the high life
Money burning a hole right
Through the pockets of holey jeans
Grandpa's with Lord now
But we got a new Ford now
And we can watch the Big Orange now
On a 57 inch TV, that's right

Money was gone by mid-July
And we went back to just getting by
'Til momma slipped on a patch of ice
Outside of Chick-Fil-A
Now we knew they was a Christian bunch
So we didn't ask for all that much
Settled out of court for ten thousand bucks
And free chicken 'til I die a day

A bunch low lives living the high life
Money burning a hole right
Through the pockets of holey jeans
Momma's got a limp now
But we all get to swim now
Cause we got an above ground
Sitting out by the trampoline

We walked, we rolled
We lived it up until it started running thin
We began looking for a way to spend that will again

I heard a song a couple months ago
Was Carrie Underwood on the radio
Reminded me of a poem my brother wrote
Back in second grade
I know she didn't steal it but so what?
We lawyered up and we sued her butt
These days we figured we'd pretty much get paid to go away

A bunch low lives living the high life
Money burning a hole right
Through the pockets of a holey jeans
This song's another one now
Know I get a hot tub now
Set it next to the above ground
Sitting out by the trampoline

It's gonna run out some day
And that ain't gonna be a fun day
But as long as it ain't a Sunday
We can go to Chick-Fil-A and eat
Aha aha

Man I love those Waffle fries
(I know)
That Chick-Fil-A has got some good waffle fries
(I'd say, that's right)
Maybe I'll get a diet Coke, I don't know
(I wish they had beer, it'd be perfect)
I like the little trays that the food comes on
(I like the Polynesian sauce)
Man that's good

Country,Brad Paisley,2017,Love and War,Meaning Again,"Sittin' on the interstate
The end of another day
Feeling tired, feeling beat up, feeling small
Sick of running this rat race
And coming in last place
Feeling like I don't matter at all

And then I walk through the door
She says ""I missed you, where ya been?""
And just like that
My life has meaning again

Sometimes work takes her away
She's gone a couple days
I overdose on ESPN
Between reruns of Sports Center
One too many drive-through windows
I wind up counting down the minutes
Till her plane comes in

And then she walks through the door
She sets her suitcase down
And then just like that
My life has meaning again

If there's one thing
I've learned in this life
It's that breathing don't make you alive
You need a reason
Some grander scheme why you're here
Buddy, I've found mine


Sometimes I think
What's the point?
This messed up world we're living in
And then she smiles
It all makes sense
Yeah, just like that
My life has meaning again"

Okay, this isn't
My finest moment by a long shot
As I walk through this casino hopin' there ain't no one I know up at 6 O'clock
With my hair messed up and my shirt untucked I hit the parking lot
""I had a real good time"", that's what she said
As she threw me my shirt and kicked me out of bed

Now as the sun comes up
It's shining a light
On the big mistake, I made last night
Vegas Strip turns into memory lane
Now pullin' on to the interstate
Excuse me while I take
The drive of shame
The drive of shame

I gave the valet my ticket
Since when is it judgment day?
I guess he was not impressed
The way I was dressed
Or my Chevrolet
I don't remember too clear
I was stinking of beer and Obsession CK

I look to my right
And who do I see
The girl I just left
Overtakin' me

And she picked one out west
She's had enough gray
The clouds need to part
Her life's been that way
She needs to recharge
Her family's been broken
Just like her heart
She's always been scared of the dark

She feels like a solar power girl
She needs to live on the bright side of the world

Her mama worked two jobs
Raised her all alone
How come superheroes always come from broken homes?
Her daddy liked to drink
Her daddy liked to swear
Best thing he ever did was vanish right into thin air
That supergirl needs sunlight so she gets in her car
She's going somewhere she can feel the Earth's closest star
She'll lay down on a blanket 'neath the Hollywood sign
And wipe all of this outta her mind

'Cause she is a solar power girl
She needs to live on the bright side of the world

Yes she's been through the storm
Her new life's begun
Like a rose 'bout to bloom in the sun

They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love
Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
They've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

There is nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

Well, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lot to help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love


You know, to me it's all so clear

All because two people fell in love

I'm sorry I was selfish, let's chalk it up to youth
I got too old to need you, that's just running from the truth
I'm sorry things didn't work out for you and my old man
Sometimes life don't turn out like you planned

Lookin' back, I wonder how you ever pulled us through
I can't imagine walking in your shoes
If I could stop this pen from shaking, I'd write these words down too
There's no one in this world I love like you

Oh, I've written down the memories of these sixty-some odd years
Trying hard to just say ""Thank you"" as I wipe away the tears
I hear my grandson calling, so I guess I better go
Could never pay you back the love I owe

And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said ""when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home"
Country,Dixie Chicks,2000,Fly,Goodbye Earl,"Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know""

Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...

Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey

Well hey, hey, hey
Aw, hey, hey, hey

Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired

Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel

But I've always found my way somehow
By taking the long way
Taking the long way around

Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to

Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm getting it back on the road now

Country,Buck Owens,1966,Dust On Mother’s Bible,Jesus Saved Me,"Once my heart was heavy I was living in sin but then I found Jesus and he took me in
And he saved me saved me and from sin set me free
Yes he saved me cause he loved me yes Jesus saved me
Once I thought I'd never find peace of mind
But I gave my heart to Jesus and he saved this soul of mine
And he saved me...

So if your heart is burdened I'll tell you what to do
Just put your trust in Jesus and he'll save you too
And he save me..."

Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy

Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here
Cause

In a world gone crazy as this

Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back

Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this

Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah me and you back at Mama's"
Country,Tim McGraw,1994,Not a Moment Too Soon,Don’t Take the Girl,"Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind""

And Johnny said:

Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm""

And Johnny said:

Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast"" and
Johnny hit his knees

And then he prayed:

Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw

And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu

I want the whole world to be hummin'

Country,Tim McGraw,2006,Reflected: Greatest Hits Vol 2,My Little Girl,"Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you, though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born

You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper ""I Love You!"" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, ""Daddy Love You More!""

You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say ""yes"" to him unless I know, he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!

You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world

Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?
I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now

Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

Full of honky tonk angels

And that’s how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles, raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But, hey, on Sunday morning, I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals, fresh-cut hay fields, and hometowns

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things

Some Kansas sweet fields I'd love to see again

And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her tires in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

The spitting image of you when you were young

I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be"
Country,Tim McGraw,2007,Let It Go,Shotgun Rider (2007),"Horses are running wide open I just got to ride
To those honky-tonk bars that stay open way past closing time
Songs 'bout free thinking and drinking sure light my fire
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron

She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Yesterday's nothing but dust I brush off my boots
While I'm wearing out roads don't you know that I'm sure missing you
If I leave you'll be wondering when I'll be back again
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in

She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Come on

Hey rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider"
Country,Tim McGraw,2004,Live Like You Were Dying,My Old Friend,"My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I would not trade them for gold
Because they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They are woven in the stories I have told
And tell again

My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There is always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend

Do not know why, do not know why
Do not know why, do not know why

My old friend, this song is for you
Because a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Because the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We will meet again, my old friend

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My old friend, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye"

I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say ""hahaha, hahaha""
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have

From places I should go
From happy Ville to loving land
I'm going to tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need

I'm footloose and fancy free

The same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby some things never change

When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song
Just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change

Maybe someday someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your loves legacy
And I'll keep holding on
Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby some things never change
Girl I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change

I still love you"

Threw an old Hank cassette tape in
Dad's '84 rusty Ford
He swore we'd never make it
I quit my job, let my momma down
Broke an angel's heart on the way out of town
Pulled my roots form the ground for

The hum of wheels on the blacktop
The strum of strings on the flattop
It's a neon fever for a small town dreamer
Tells you everything you have is worth losing
Damn country music

You might get lost in the lights
The things that keep you up all night
Whiskey straight, 3 am
Chasing songs in your head
It's the sweetest highs, the lowest lows
It's needing ""yes"" and hearing ""no""
Just another sold soul
Believe me, I know it's

The hum of wheels on the blacktop
The strum of strings on the flattop
It'll take you, break you
Damn sure make you do things
You never thought you'd be doing
Damn country music

When the money, the fame
The lights on your name all fade away
Well, you'll still be a slave to

The hum of wheels on the blacktop
The strum of strings on the flattop

Tells you everything you have is worth losing

Tried to shake your shadow, but you follow me 'round
Baby, it don't matter what I do
It all keeps comin' back to you
I've been stayin' up, I've been losin' sleep
All them country songs sayin' pour another drink
Baby, that won't drown out what we had, and girl

I want you back, back in my arms
Back of the yellow cab, chasin' kisses in the dark
Back, back to your place
With your red-wine lips, sayin', ""Come here, baby""

And I ain't even gonna act
Like I don't need you, miss you, wish that you would
Come on home
Baby, I want you back
Want you back
Want you back
Want you back

The color of the night, baby, it ain't like
Like it used to be when we were burnin' it bright
But then the fire turned ice cold
And now it's all smoke and shadows
Wanna grab the phone, wanna call you up
Tell you that I'll take it just the way that it was
Every little fight, the makin' up all night
All the good, all the bad

I want you back, back in my arms
Back of the yellow cab, chasin' kisses in the dark
Back, back to your place

Country,Randy Travis,2002,Rise and Shine,Three Wooden Crosses,"A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
And did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered, ""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see
He said, ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me""

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway"
Country,Randy Travis,1988,Old 8x10,Deeper Than the Holler,"Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love,
Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above.
Well, I come from the country, and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty, and the stars, they sometimes fall.
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew
My love is deeper than the holler.
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill.
From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And every one is different, and every one's the same
And this is just another way of sayin' the same thing
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
A Whippoorwill"

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me

Well, the flowers will be blooming and the grass will be green
And the skies will be clear and serene
Where the sun ever beams in this valley of dreams
And no clouds there will ever will be seen

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me

Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb
And the beast from the wild shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me someday"
Country,Randy Travis,1993,Wind in the Wire,Cowboy Boogie,"When he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
Camps in an old line shack way back in the sticks
He loves to tie 'em down and burn their hide
And there ain't no rough string he can't ride
But cuttin' a rug is how he gets his kicks

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

So it's adios to his old payoose
And down the road to turn it loose
At an old dance hall he cuts that gal out straight
Spins her sideways through the herd
He's bucking like he's being spurred
Twisting and a rocking like a bronc
Coming outta the gate

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay


Well he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
A true ? walking fool, he ain't no dude
The Fred Astaire of hill and range
Two parts cool and one part strange
He's the best out west at any altitude

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way

Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yah yippy

Country,Randy Travis,2002,Rise and Shine,Pray For The Fish,"Everybody gathered where the river runs wider
At the edge of town
To see if that Eddie Lee Vaughn baptism
Was really gonna go down
Folks bet their hard earned money that water wouldn't change a thing
They set the odds at a hundred to one his soul wouldn't never come clean
Then the preacher said, ""People take a moment or two
There's something we need to do, pray for the fish""
They won't know what's comin'
When the sin starts rolling off the like's of him
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave them just a little bit of room to swim?
Pray for the fish
Well, the preacher ducked 'em under
That cool clear water, then he did it again
Eddie came up yellin', ""Lord in Heaven
Halleauh, I'm a brand new man""
Well, the water got to bubblin', sky got to rumblin'
And the thunder backed up the choir, the fish started jumpin'
It was like they was swimmin' in a lake of fire
Then Eddie's momma stepped out of the crowd
And started yellin' out loud, ""Pray for the fish""

Country,Randy Travis,1992,Greatest Hits Volume Two,"Look Heart, No Hands","I remember how it used to feel
Riding down old two mile hill
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars
Paying no mind to the passing cars
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here
No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
It took a little time to get up to speed
To find the confidence and strength I'd need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You know sometimes it felt I could fly
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here
No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
It doesn't take much
Just a smile or a touch
And I'm a kid again
I can almost feel that wind
No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall

Look heart, no hands"
Country,Randy Travis,1991,High Lonesome,Point Of Light,"There is a point when you cannot walk away
When you have to stand up straight and tall and mean the word you say
There is a point you must decide, just to do it 'cause it's right
That's when you become a point of light
There is a darkness that everyone must face
It wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste
And that darkness covers everything in sight
Until it meets a single point of light
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light
There are heroes, whose names we never hear
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers
Reaching out to feed the hungry, reaching out to save the land
Reaching out to help their fellow man
There are dreamers, who are making dreams come true
Taking time to to teach the children, there's nothing they can't do
Giving shelter to the homeless, giving hope to those without
Isn't that what this land's all about?
One by one, from the mountains to the sea
Points of light are calling out to you and me
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light"

Country,Randy Travis,1986,Storms of Life,The Storms Of Life,"There's a dirty piece of cardboard that reads Montgomery Ward
Taped across the window of my old Ford
A six-pack on the front seat and a box of chicken wings
I'm dialin' 'cross the radio for a song that I can sing
I'd better change my wandrin' ways
I know I've seen my better days
Always gettin' high when I get low
Well, I left my soul out in the rain
Lord, what a price, I've had to pay
The storms of life are washin' me away
An old mail pouch, tobacco sign, fadin' on the barn
Bringin' back sweet memories of mama's farm
When love was just a country girl, that lived on down the road
You know, she almost had me turned around but that was years ago
I'd better change my wandrin' ways
I know I've seen my better days
Always gettin' high when I get low
Well, I left my soul out in the rain

Country,Randy Travis,2000,Inspirational Journey,Baptism,"The summer breeze made ripples on the pond
And rattled through the reeds, and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat and mama in her Sunday dress
Watched with pride as I stood there, in the water up to my chest

And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
As I sank my toes into that cool East Texas mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the ways of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But, I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing Grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins, which were many, were washed away and gone
Along with a Buffalo Nickel, I forgot to leave at home

But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

It was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the ways of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But, I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul it must be cleansed
And I long to feel that water rushing over me again

I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord
I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord"

When the shadows of this life have gone, I'll fly away

Country,Randy Travis,1989,Old 8x10,Promises,"Cheap perfume and painted faces
Fallen angles fill the places
Where I go when my troubles pull me down
All the lies I know they'll tell me
And the time that they will sell me
For a while I'll be the biggest man in town
Back at home in bed she's crying
For her love for me is dying
But she'll pry I make it safely through the night
When the mornin' sun starts showing
To her bedside I'll be going
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light
And I'll make promises
Promises to change
I'll make her promises swear I'll rearrange
And I'll start giving all the love she needs
If only she will stay
Once again she'll reasure me and
I believe her love will cure me
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face
Lord I know she's just a woman
And her love can't last forever
And someday soon I know she'll
Leave without a trace
For broken' promises
Will tear her dreams apart
Just token promises will someday break her heart
And for the last time she'll hold me when I cry
And while I'm sleeping
She'll quietly say goodbye"
Country,Randy Travis,1993,Greatest Hits Volume One,An Old Pair Of Shoes,"I've walked a million miles across this floor
But I never have quite made it to the door
I never thought the time would come
I'd ever see this day
You could make me feel so thrown away
I'm feeling like an old pair of shoes
All worn out from walking through these blues
There's a hole in my soul
And I'm really feeling used
I'm just like an old pair of shoes
You've always been my one and only love
It ain't no easy thing to give you up
Looking back I'm feeling like
There's nothing left to lose
This time I may just walk out on you
'Cause I'm feeling like an old pair of shoes
All worn out from walking through these blues
There's a hole in my soul
And I'm really feeling used
I'm just like an old pair of shoes
There's a hole in my soul

I'm just like an old pair of shoes"

You seem so much better than when we were together
Don’t even tell me his name
Heard you found what you’re looking for
Now you’re not crying anymore
CHORUS
But that smile he put on your face it breaks my heart in two
I hate to admit it but love looks good on you
I still remember that day
We started packing up boxes, you said let’s cut our losses
And get out of each others way
It’ll be good in the long run and I knew I’d find someone
CHORUS
It wasn’t your fault it wasn’t mine
It’s just the way things work out sometime
It wasn’t easy walking away knowing he’s taken my place
But it was sure good to see you yesterday
You seem so much better than when we were together
Please don’t tell me his name
Yeah he’s all I’ve been looking for and I’m not lonely anymore

I still remember that day
I hate to admit it but love looks good on you"

Country,Randy Travis,2000,Inspirational Journey,Don’t Ever Sell Your Saddle,"Daddy shoulda been a preacher man
'Cause everybody loved to hear him speak
He didn't always follow his own advice
But we got a sermon every week
He'd say, ""Trouble always starts as fun
And broken hearts will always mend
Tough times don't last, tough people do
And nothing breaks if it can bend""
""Don't ever sell your saddle
Never owe another man
Watch where you spit on a windy day
Don't use words you don't understand""
""Find the Lord before you need Him
And never lose your pride
Don't ever sell your saddle
'Cause life's a long, long ride""
Daddy never ran from anything
Always took his share of the blame
Had a heart big enough to fill a valley up
But hard enough to stop a train
He said, ""Only fight when you have to
Because there's always a faster gun
And you'll know a hero from a coward
When you see which way they run""
""Don't ever sell your saddle
Never owe another man
Watch where you spit on a windy day
Don't use words you don't understand""
""Find the Lord before you need Him
And never lose your pride
Don't ever sell your saddle
'Cause life's a long, long ride""
Daddy left me his old saddle
The day that he passed on
And these words are etched into my mind
Just like they were in stone
""Don't ever sell your saddle
Never owe another man
Watch where you spit on a windy day
Don't use words you don't understand""
""Find the Lord before you need Him
And never lose your pride
Don't ever sell your saddle
'Cause life's a long, long ride
Don't ever sell your saddle
'Cause life's a long, long ride"""
Country,Randy Travis,1987,Always & Forever,I Won’t Need You Anymore (Always & Forever),"You're my always and forever
You're the one that hung the moon
After all these nights together
I still get lost in your perfume
And if I could write a love song
Every line would tell the truth
It would be a warm and soft one
And my heart would say to you
When you see me walk on water
When the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over
I won't need you anymore
Oh, the feelings lay so easy
Lyin' here the way we are
No one else could ever hold me
Like the heavens hold the stars
When you see me walk on water
When the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over
I won't need you anymore
I won't need you anymore"

If you could only hear the music playing

Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee

And time for me will be no more

Country,Randy Travis,1998,You and You Alone,"Spirit of a Boy, Wisdom of a Man","He was sixteen, tender and tough
She was too, and he'd do anything to prove his love
With so much riding on the choice at hand
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man
Hearts caught fire and love ran wild
She cried the day she called to say she was having his child
With so much riding on the choice at hand
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man
There's a constant contradiction, what feels good and what feels right
But you live with decisions that you make in your life
And what steers your direction is hard to understand
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man
Now he drives a diesel out of Dallas, hauling cars out to the coast
It ain't the dream that he remembered, just a few short years ago
But tonight at a truck stop, while drinking a cup
The waitress grins and winks at him and says, ""My shift's almost up""
With so much riding on the choice at hand
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man
With so much riding on the choice at hand
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man"

I heard freedom break it's chain
I heard a heart beat where once no sound remained
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
Beating softly against the waves
Fell a sound of an early morning rain
And though the lightin' and thunder came
I still heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name"

Just how much you mean to me, I carved your name right next to mine
And it'll be there till the end of time, and my love will last at least that long
It's written in stone how I feel for you, it's written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and the life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be a hundred, or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know what I feel for you, is written in stone
There's a place on the edge of town, when I was a kid I found
Two names on a stone together, lying side by side forever
And it was then and there I knew, if I ever thought a love was true
I'd surely want to write it down, on something that would be around
When all the spoken words have come and gone
It's written in stone how I feel for you, it's written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and the life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be a hundred, or if we don't make it half that long
I want you to know what I feel for you, is written in stone
And when this life has come and gone, our love will still be
Written in stone how I feel for you, written in stone what I want to do
Spend my life and the life hereafter loving you
And darling if we live to be a hundred, or if we don't make it half that long

A wife to demanding with no understanding
Of why I stay dead on my feet
A dimly lit tavern a willing young woman
Are some of the reasons I cheat
The hair that I'm losing and a women who's choosing
To lay sound asleep by my side
The bills they are mounting that's when I start counting
On someone to help sooth my pride
A lady that knows me affection she shows me and a smile so easy and sweet
The dreams that I've buried the load that I've carried
Are some of the reasons I cheat
My children keep on growing me age keeps on showing
Like all of my old friends I meet

Well, Nobody seems to care I ain't guilty
I never did the things they said I've done
But I guess they have to hang somebody
And It's looking like I'm gonna be the one
So send my body home on a freight trian
Don't worry none if I don't go 1st class
Send my body home of a fright train
So everyone can see me when I pass
Don't worry none about no fancy funeral
Cause it don't matter how they lay me down
Just see they bury me out by Mama's Apple Tree
And send my body back to my home town
My Mama was a damm ahrd working woman
And she tried to raise he kids without a fault
The last thing sh said, she was on her dying bed was ""Son, on't get in trouble with the law""
When the time comes to meet my maker
I'm gonna try my very best
To take it like a man
When they ask if I have one request
I'll just say ""send my body home on a freight trian
Don't worry none if I don't go 1st class
Send my body home of a fright train
So everyone can see me when I pass""

Tell me, who did they think
Who did they think he was?
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?
The whole world bowed and prayed
But it only makes me say
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?

He was born in Massachusetts
In 1917
The second child of an Irishman
Oh we all loved Kennedy

He was brave and strong and handsome
A helluva president
But when he died
Millions cried like he was heaven sent

Tell me, who did they think
Who did they think he was?
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?
The whole world bowed and prayed
But it only makes me say
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?

There was a child of Heaven
Born in Bethlehem
Just a simple carpenter
With worn and calloused hands

Oh He healed the hearts of many
So they nailed Him to a tree
With no one left to mourn His death
But the women at His feet crying

Who did they think
Who did they think He was?
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?
There was no one left to grieve
But the women at his feet crying
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?

Who did they think

Country,Tammy Wynette,1967,D-I-V-O-R-C-E,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughnin' coal pile, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind"
Country,Emmylou Harris,1995,Wrecking Ball,Goin’ Back To Harlan,"There were no cuckoos, no sycamores
We played about the forest floor
Underneath the silver maples, the balsams, and the sky
We popped the heads off dandelions
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes
Rested on the riverbank and grew up by and by
And grew up by and by
Frail my heart apart
And play me a little ""Shady Grove""
Ring the bells of Rhymney
'Til they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow
Rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
And if you were Willie Moore
And I was Barbara Allen
Or Fair Ellen all sad at the cabin door
A-weeping and a-pining for love
A-weeping and a-pining for love
Frail my heart apart
And play me a little ""Shady Grove""
Ring the bells of Rhymney
'Til they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow
Rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream

All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there, I'm sure I made you cry

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowing up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
'Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye

Was I just off somewhere or just too high?

Country,Kris Kristofferson,1970,Me and Bobby McGee,Sunday Morning Coming Down,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my brain the night before
On cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at  a can that he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somehow, somewhere along the way
On the Sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks
Sunday mornin' comin' down
In the park, I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
On the Sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
Makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalk
Sunday mornin' comin' down
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do"

And memories like spies
And salt betrays my eyes again
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
And wishing I was was ten again
So I could be your friend again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
I heard you found some pretty words to say
You found your little game to play
And there's no one allowed in
Then just when we believe we could be great
Reality it permeates
And conquers from within again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine

Am I strong enough to get down on my knees and pray
Am I high enough on the chain of evolution

And perfect myself in my own peculiar way
I get lazy, and forget my obligations
I'd go crazy, if I paid attention all the time
And I want justice, but I'll settle for some mercy
On this Holy Road through the Universal Mind
I get lazy, and forget my obligations
I'd go crazy, if I paid attention all the time
And I want justice, but I'll settle for some mercy

I got happy, there wasn't nothing else to do

I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world would end
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay

I waited, but you must have lost your way

For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine

My heart can sing when I pause to remember
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along a path that's winding always upward
This troubled world is not my final home
But until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home

The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for a while
And things of earth that cause this heart to tremble
Remember there will only bring a smile
But until then my heart will go on singing..."

For me to go and find my favorite girl
Cause when I look into her eyes I see
All the love there is in all the world
And it always will be
And always will be
And it always will be
It always will be
There are some things I think about
And every time I do it breaks my heart
And there's nothing I can do
About this loneliness I feel when we're apart
And I stop and curse the darkness and the distance
And then your face I see
And when I look into your eyes I see
All the love that's left inside of me

It's knowing that you're always there to fill my glass
You and me together, girl, we've made the first time last
This thing of ours, this love we share
The comfort knowing when I turn I'll find you there
By my side, for the long, long ride
This thing of ours
When it's done and the credits roll
Let it be said together that we stole the show
We'll save the last ""I love you"" for the curtain call

Country,Keith Urban,2016,Ripcord,Wasted Time,"The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now

I've had my share of pain
I got scars in places that you can't even see, baby
But it made me who I am today
So when it rains, when there's a hurricane
You got to find your wave and just surf it
Put some love in the world, find a boy or a girl
To heal all the hurt 'cause you know you deserve it

So ride
On a wave so free, just you and me

Pullin' up on the scene and we sting 'em
Focused and floatin', we drinkin' and singin'

Been a long time coming, but it's all (it's all good baby)
For the better (oh yeah)

I didn’t feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love

And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

Maybe you don’t understand
I don’t understand it all myself
But there’s a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
He’s got a photograph
And they’re waiting for him back home
It’s weighing on my mind
I’m not trying to be a hero
I don’t wanna die
But right now in this moment, you don’t think twice

And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you
You don’t think about right
You don’t think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
And I’d do the same
For you
Yes I would
I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice

Could I take a bullet

The sun to go down

I want to see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi

I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me

Because I'm riding with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flying away

And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me

Now she's strumming on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And singing to me the sweetest song

And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me

They're arguing' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shouting' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I can see that old man
He's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone it never rings
He wanders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me

It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us till we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart

Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Storming like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday

Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender in much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls

Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain
Pray that it's raining on Sunday

I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'til summer comes around

I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days 'tell you just might come back

But then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
Till summer comes around

Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a Ferris wheel rocking with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And ""Baby I'll be back again"" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
'til summer comes around


'til summer comes around yeah
Mmm...

Goodbye city I'm country bound

Punching that clock and carrying that load
I bust it all week and then I'm free
The weekend belongs to me

Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends

Give me some time with you in my arms
Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise

I want you to be happier

When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we’ve begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
I know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I’ve been thinking
I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I’m left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with somebody else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we’re okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute

Country,Glen Campbell,1967,Gentle On My Mind,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, cold towel, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind"

On the road to my horizon

And a smile can hide all the pain

And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'

Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch
Your sea birds flying in the sun

She'll prob'ly stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall that's all

In a snow bank in Illinois
But the driver was missing
And the search had been abandoned
Because the weather had everything stalled
And they had checked all the houses and the local motels
When they had some more news they'd call
And she told them when they found him
To tell him that she loved him
And she hung up the phone singing


Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long
Thinking nothing but the worst is coming

Asking her if she had been singing the song, singing

And these days, that's a special way of life
(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checker board
Old men tellin' lies and crownin' kings
Kids drivin' 'round the old town square
Cops roll down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen
(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised
Down home
Down home

Folks know
If there fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

Down home
Way down home
Down home
Down home
Way down home
Down home"
Country,Alabama,1986,The Touch,Touch Me When We’re Dancing,"Play us a song we can slow dance on
We want to hold each other
Play us a groove so we hardly move
Just let our hearts be together
Oh baby, 'cause it feels so good
When we're close like this
Whisper in my ear and let me steal a kiss

Come on and touch me when we're dancin'
You know you've got that lovin' touch
Oh oh touch me when we're dancin'
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love

Tonight's the night and it feels so right
What my heart's saying to me
You're the one and I've waited so long
So let your love flow thru me
Oh baby cause it feels so good we can be this close
You got me up so high
I could fly coast to coast

Come on and touch me when we're dancin'
You know you've got that lovin' touch
Oh oh touch me when we're dancin'
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love"

When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way

Settling down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?""

He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up
At Kitty's place

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west, young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

We’ve got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets

The party was Huntsville, it was after the show
Alone in the front lounge, just me and him
I took one friendly puff and the grim creeper set in

You can pour me some Old Whiskey River my friend
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again

I can tell one's a coming because I'm smelling smoke
No I do not partake I just let it pass by
With a grin on my face and a great contact high
I'll never smoke weed with Willie again

Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning ‘bout right by doin’ it wrong
Hopin’ we didn’t get caught

And we spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Oh

Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place and she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues ‘bout

Spendin'what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas

I got me a job doing lawnmower repair
I met an army recruiter down at the Wynn Dixie
He said ""son you've no future, pack up and go with me""

The first place we landed was a base called Ballad
They convoyed our asses to a 10 acre F.O.B
With my boots and my cover and an old M16
Two bottles of water and a cold M.R.E

Oh you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade
It's not a job, it's an adventure, oh yes sir I got that
Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at
You never told me I'd get my ass shot at

The first night in combat we went out on patrol
They ambushed our convey and we chased the asshole
We found them all hiding in low water ditches
And we took aim and killed all them son of a bitches

Oh you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade
It's not a job, it's an adventure, oh yes sir I got that
Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at
You never told me I'd get my ass shot at

Walked in on my buddy with a female M.P
The ugliest woman you ever did see
He said ""why are you laughing, you got lots of nerve""
Over here in the desert we grade on the curve

Ah you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade

Her name was Gina
(You've never been here before have you)
They met at a bar called Cabo Wabo Cantina
He was a minstered salesman from South Dakota
She was a first grade school teacher Phoenix Arizona
(No, my first time here)
They started dancing and it got real hot
Then it spilled over to the parking lot
One more tequila they were falling in love
One more is never enough

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico

He woke up in the morning and he made a little telephone call
To check on his wife and his kids back at home in Sioux Falls
(Hey babe everything okay)
She hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind
(What am I doing)
He knew it was the first time Gina had ever crossed that line
They walked down to the beach and started drinking again
Jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim

One more margarita then we're falling in love
One more's never enough

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh Mexico

Waiting at the bar at the terminal gate
She says ""Steve I gotta go, I'm going to miss my plane""
He said ""one more tequila for you climb on up""
She said ""one more's never enough""

Nothing I could say ever seemed to matter
So I took a little drive just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon up ahead
It looked like a place to find some satisfaction
With a little less talk and a lot more action

I paid the man at the door and pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool tried to mess with my head
But I did not even listen in a word he said
I knew somewhere amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk and a lot more action

A little less talk if you please
A lot more loving is what I need
Let us get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action

Well she was fighting them off at a corner table
She had a longneck bottle she was peeling the label
The look on her face it was perfectly clear
She said somebody please get me out of here
The look she shot me through the glass refraction
Said a little less talk and a lot more action

A little less talk if you please
A lot more loving is what I need
Let us get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action"

They stay higher than the water tower

She said it ain't the drugs, it ain't the booze

Smoking a stolen Marlboro Light and
On a good night might kill a fifth of Crown

And crazy, it ain't them that let them down

The neighbor kids have done away
With the shirts and skins
No one hits the front porch lights
To get their kids to come inside
Cause the streets ain't safe
For a bike to ride down

Same last name, same everything

So I'm a go on and take a swing

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny

Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you

What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour

What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you

Mine would be...you"
Country,Blake Shelton,2001,Blake Shelton,Austin,"She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you"
Country,Blake Shelton,2013,Based on a True Story...,Sure Be Cool If You Did,"I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon

Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me

Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time

We don't have to be lonely tonight

We don't have to be lonely tonight

I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and

We don't have to be lonely tonight

And I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know

I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl, no

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, ""Ain’t she beautiful?""
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile

But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home

Let me go home

Can’t fight it, girl you put it on me
Yeah you stone me, when you ain’t with me

No it ain't easy, that's for sure

Something different 'bout a Friday night

And it's just for me
Damn you make it hard to leave

Country,Blake Shelton,2002,The Dreamer,The Baby,"My brother said that I
Was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child
So I got by with more

I guess she was tired by
The time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried
I could do no wrong
She would always save me
Because I was her baby

I worked a factory in Ohio
A shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham
Turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy
I said ""Your boy is now a man""
She said ""I don't care if you're 80
You’ll always be my baby""

She loved that photograph
Of our whole family
She'd always point us out
For all her friends to see

That's Greg he's doing great
He really loves his job
And Ronnie with his 2 kids
How about that wife he's got
And that one's kind of crazy
But that one is my baby

I got a call in Alabama
Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
Cause your mamma really needs you
And says she's got to see you
She might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80
So she could see her baby

She looked like she was sleeping
And my family had been weeping
By the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been taken
And my heart it was breaking
I never got to say goodbye

I softly kissed that lady
And cried just like a baby"

I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new

That blond blonde blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

...or not
I can call a car it will be two minutes
'Til it's at the bar and we hop in it
It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone

So if you wanna come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and baby I got mine

But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you’ve been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you

There's a reason that we're both here right now
And a reason everything didn't work out
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time

Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you’ve been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you

So baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine

But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together

So baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine
But every goodbye"
Country,Blake Shelton,2017,Texoma Shore,The Wave,"We were talking on a boardwalk
We were lit up when the lights came down
So we drifted toward the music
And you kissed me as the sound
Of my favorite band was playing
But I couldn't hear them 'cause my heart
Was beating loud and out of rhythm
As you drowned out all the dark

I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water, you were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was a castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave, the wave, the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away

We talked for a couple of hours
We got salt all over our jeans
And we laughed about forever
What the hell did that really mean?
And all of a sudden, thanks to you
My favorite color was blue
I never saw you coming
Sweet salvation and I never knew

I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water, you were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was a castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave, the wave, the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away

I was a town closed for winter
I was a Ferris wheel with the lights burned out
'Til you came along, when you came along

I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water, you were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was a castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave, the wave, the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away

Yeah, you washed it all away
You were the wave, the wave, the wave
Yeah, that washed it all away"

And his light shines on me

Though the devil tried to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be

I'm standing in my savior's shadow
Following his footsteps there
Every mountain, every ocean
Here's my every prayer

Whatcha say we slip away, rock a few night moves
Spend the evening in some cozy conversations
Bartender shaking up a having us a good time groove
Then we'll keep the party going when they close it down at two

Me and you
Are hangover due
I'm just saying
Wanna wake up, girl, with our heads a little banging
Laying in them tangled up sheets just laughing
Trying to piece together just what the hell happened
Looking over the crime scene, only seeing my jeans
And a pair of your high heel shoes
Me and you
Are hangover due

Lemme order you another pinkatini number
Pretty soon or later, you'll be bumming a cigarette
Get my whiskey mixing with your tipsy little hot mess
Black dress kisses
Guess what happens next
Yeah, a night we can't remember
I'm never gonna forget

Country,Blake Shelton,2016,Startin’ Fires,Green,"Lookout!
People used to call me backwards
Living out here with the tractors
Letting this world leave me behind
Now-a-days I'm an innovator
I'm a country boy prognosticator
I'm a man ahead of my times

I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a John Deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans
I've got a guitar I play unplugged
I've got a home-grown girl I love
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing

Sheets on the clothes line drying
Red Tail hawks a flying
A couple of deer on the timber line
And I know a lot more about cane pole fishing
Then I ever will know about carbon emission
And my little corner of the world is doing just fine

Yeah, I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deer in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of root baked potatoes and greens
I've got a guitar I play unplugged

Y andale...
Pero si vieras
Como son lindas estas borracheras
Y andale...
Pero hasta cuando
Dejan tus padres de andarte cuidando
Y andale...
Cada vez que vengo a verte
Siempre me voy resbalando;
O es que tengo mala suerte
O es que me esta lloviznando
Y andale...
Pero si vieras
Seco mi chaco en mi higuera floreando
Y andale...
Pero si cuando
Seco mi chaco en mi higuera floreando
Y andale...
Me dices que soy un necio
Porque me ando emborrachando
Y a pesar de tus deprecios
Yo quiero seguir tomando, y andale
Pero si vieras
Como son lindas estas borracheras...
Y andale...
Pero que bellas
Paso las horas vaciando botellas

That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks

Where I sit alone and think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart she'll come back someday

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams

Country,Brooks & Dunn,2005,Hillbilly Deluxe,Believe,"Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
""How you keep from goin' crazy""
He said, ""I'll see my wife and son in just a little while""
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled

Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe""

A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, ""Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died""

Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye

Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see...""

I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be... no, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is

Lord, I raise my hands
Bow my head
Oh, I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red

Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying

Old boys feeling like a dog on a collar
Keeping that chain pulled tight
Waiting on Saturday night
Put on the smell-good, put on Skynard
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner
Cruising back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze
Everywhere you look, all you see

Is hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little home grown
A country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe

Yeah, couple cute sweet things driving a fastback
Shoot 'em a cool smile hoping that they smile back
""Hey, Baby, what's you name?""
Burn a little rubber when the red lights change
Here come the blue lights, here come Barney
Hide all the beer, y'all, let's move the party
Gotta go, but that's all right
Do it all again next Friday night

Hillbilly Deluxe, slick pick-em-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little homegrown
A country girl cuddled up

Country,Brooks & Dunn,1997,The Greatest Hits Collection,He’s Got You,"I thought we would always be together
The love we shared was gonna last forever
Once I was your one and only
Now here I sit, Mister Lonely

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

Beneath this dark cloud you left me under
Can't sort it out so I'll sit and wonder
Tell myself, ""It hurts, don't it""
Now my empty heart will be forever haunted

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose

You're stepping out all over town
Drove me back to drinking in this bar
I found myself a brand new friend
I'm headed down that road again
Working on my next broken heart
Happy or sad, it's hard to tell
You taught me how to hurt so well
But when it comes to love I know my part
I'll play this game that I can't win
I'll be somebody's fool again
Working on my next broken heart

I thought all along you would
Be the death of me
I met one tonight who wants
What's left of me
I've seen that look before
She'll tear my world apart

I just don't lie awake at night
Asking God to get you off my mind
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time
Yeah, I got to work on time again this morning
This ol' job is all that I got left
And no one even noticed I'd been crying
But at least I don't have whiskey on my breath
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time
God I hope you're happy
Girl I wish you well
I just might get over you
You can't ever tell
I always thought that I'd do something crazy
If I ever saw you out with someone else
But when the moment came last night, I couldn't say a word
I stood there in the dark all by myself
Yeah, I could have said a million things
But all I did was keep it locked inside

Country,Brooks & Dunn,1992,Brand New Man,Lost and Found,"I lost her trail on a Friday night
She was gone before I got home
She'd been getting restless
In that big house all alone
I've been up and down these city streets
For three nights in a row
And lord it's hard to find that girl
When she gets the urge to go

It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Asking bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon

And I know she'll be coming back
Her car is waiting right outside
But, I don't want to think about
Who's taking her for a ride
And her unpredictability
Is what I love about her best
Lord I've got to find her quick
Before she does something I regret


She's out there somewhere
Burning up the night
Somehow I've got to run her down
I'm running out of time"

Said, ""Goodbye, baby,"" you left without warnin'
Like a thief in the night, you ran away with my heart
I can't believe my eyes, must be a bad dream
You always said we had a good thing
You never once let on we were fallin' apart

That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, was it all a lie
After all this time, that ain't no way to go

Gettin' nowhere, I'm tired of thinkin'
Guess I'll do a little wishful dreamin'
And make a whiskey wish upon a star
Train whistle blowin' down the track
Lonesome sound says she ain't comin' back
It's such a cold blow from out of the dark

That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, now was it all a lie
After all this time...

That ain't no way to go, now girl, it just ain't right

Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle

She wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein
And cheap sunglasses from the five and dime
All the other girls in school they give her dirty looks
She got an ""A"" in math and never cracked a book
Sure looks good in her denim and pearls
Rock my world little Country girl

Rock my world
Drag me out on the floor
Dance with me till I can't dance anymore
One-step, two-step, get in a line
I gotta find a way to make you mine

I tell her that I love her but it ain't enough
She says I got to learn to loosen up
Get a little wild on Saturday night
But make sure she's home before the morning light
Sunday she's all ribbons and curls
Rock my world little Country girl

Drag me out on the floor
Dance with me till I can't dance anymore

I gotta find a way to make you mine

Country,Brooks & Dunn,2001,Steers & Stripes,The Long Goodbye,"I know they say if you love somebody, you should set them free
But it sure is hard to do, it sure is hard to do
I know they say if you don't come back again, then it's meant to be (So they say)
Those words don't pull me through, 'cause I'm still in love with you

I spend each day here waitin' for a miracle
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill, climbin' up a hill

This is a long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really, give our love a chance (Just one more chance)
But I know without a doubt, we turned it inside out
And if we walked away would it make more sense
But it tears me up inside, just to think we could still try

How long must we keep runnin' on a carousel
Goin' 'round and 'round and never gettin' anywhere, on a wing and prayer

This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye

Long goodbye

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

Mesmerized by the gaze
There was some kind of magic
That led me away"

Out gunned the Chevys and out run the law
Out skirts of town looking down on the light

I'll help you get over
The hurt you thought you never could forget
The bitter tears you tasted
All those nights you wasted

An' two doors down there's a heartache
That once was my friend
An' two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
Two doors down there's a bar stool
That knows me by name
And we sit there together
And wait for you
Two doors down there's a bottle
Where I take out my shame
And hold it up
For the whole world to view
Two doors down there's a pay phone
But no calls come in
An' two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
From the hotel to the barroom
Is just a stumble and a fall
And sometimes when it gets bad
I've been known to crawl
Freedom from sorrow
Is just two doors away
I'll escape for a short time
But I know I can't stay
Two doors down is where they'll find me
When you're finally through
Taking what's left of my life
An' two doors down is where they'll leave me
When payment comes due
For the hours I've spent there each night
Two doors down I'll be forgotten

Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end"

If you ever get south of the Ohio River down where Dixieland begins
If you ever get south of Cincinnati I'll be yours again

And a rose pressed inside the book of Luke
For fourteen years she'd write each day but keep it hidden
Refused to even speak his name, but still she wrote

If you ever get south of the Mason-Dixon to the home you left so long ago
If you ever get south of the Ohio River down where Dixieland begins
If you ever get south of Cincinnati I'll be yours again
At a cold gray apartment in Chicago
A cigarette drowns inside a glass of gin
He lies there drunk, but it don't matter drunk or sober
He'll never read the words that pride won't let her send
Chorus:
If you ever get south of Cincinnati down where the dogwood trees grow

That I'll endure this pain
'Cause this time
Is the last time
She'll ever hurt me again
I tell myself each morning
That we're through
But every night I see
That it's not true
I run out
And track her down
Just so I can hang around
And cry
(Chorus)
Come on heart let's make believe we're fine
We'll both agree the pain's just in our mind
I'll close my eyes and try not to hear
The things I'll say when she appears
To haunt me
(Chorus)
Yeah, this time
Is the last time
That she'll ever hurt me again"

Country,John Denver,1974,Back Home Again,This Old Guitar,"This old guitar taught me to sing a love song
Showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold lonely night

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together
I guess it broke her heart
But it opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be

This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountain side
Most of all, to sing my songs for you
Ooh, I love to sing my songs for you
Yes I do, Lord, I love to sing my songs for you"

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Country,John Denver,1985,Dreamland Express,Trail of Tears,"No more beautiful moons may we spend on our land
In the north, the scarlet council talks of war
And the long knives have massacred the tribe
And burned our corn
We're not welcome in our homeland anymore
No more songs of the hunters on the baffalo plain
No more smoke from sacred fires touch these hills
And the numbers of the people grow fewer every mile
And our children will not leave the Great Spirit's ways
There will be a trail of tears
There will be a trail of pain
And Jackson will have the Mississippi
And the twenty dollar bill
But for us the trail is all that will remain
On the streets of Rapid City
On the road to Wounded Knee
There is whiskey for forgetting everything
But the old ones say
""There may be time learning from each other
The way that it had once been meant to be""
There is still a trail of tears
There is still a trail of pain
And Jackson has got the Mississippi
And the twenty dollar bill
But for us the trail of tears remains
And Jackson has got the Mississippi
And the twenty dollar bill
But how long will the trail of tears remain?"

Nights are too long for me

Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you

Landmark the sailor's journeys end
No matter what seas I've have been sailing on

That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear

On your pillow at night

Country,Alison Krauss,2007,A Hundred Miles or More: A Collection,Jacob’s Dream,"In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting; the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side

The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

Oh Mommy and Daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

Now Jacob Dibert woke one night from a strange and eerie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights, the dream returned, this vision sent from God

Oh Mommy and Daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of Bob's Creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there, Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still, beneath the old birch tree

Oh Mommy and Daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in heaven now; God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at heaven's door

Oh Mommy and Daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in heaven now; God is by our side
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at heaven's door"
Country,Alison Krauss,1999,Forget About It,That Kind of Love,"Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love
I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love
Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair
But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love"

Time can't erase
A lover's embrace
Can't you hear it calling
A new day dawning
You were longing to find
Love's taken you far
Away from my heart
And I've been here all along
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine
A vision that's faded through time
But you sail away
Far on a summer's day
But you heard it calling
A new day dawning
You were longing to find
There is a way
To make you stay
Darling don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
And keep us apart

Don't doubt your heart

You see, it takes a special kinda woman
To put with the life a cowboy leads
Cause his boots are always muddy
And his beer drinkin buddies
Will camp out on your couch and never leave

Don't even start to think you're gonna change him

As sure as winter turns to spring

Somebody somewhere don't know
Come on now, child, we're gonna go for a ride
Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road

Can't find a damn thing in this place
Nothing's where I left it before
Set of keys and a dusty suitcase

There goes the screen door slamming shut
You better do what you're told
When I get back this room better be picked-up

Low hum of voices in the front seat
Stories nobody knows
Got folks in Jackson we're going to meet

Cotton fields stretching miles and miles
Hank's voice on the radio
The telephone poles, trees, and wires fly on by
Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road

Broken down shacks, engine parts
Could tell a lie but my heart would know
Listen to the dogs barkin' in the yard
Car wheels on a gravel road

Child in the backseat about four or five years
Lookin' out the window
Little bit of dirt mixed with tears

Southern secrets still buried deep
Brooding and restless 'neath the cracked concrete
If you were from here you would defend me to the death
Along with the ghosts of highway twenty
I went through hell when I was younger
Deep in the well you'll see the hunger
To find the strength I've got within me
To wrestle with the ghosts of highway twenty
Been sixty years, I don't want for nothing
But my tears they keep on coming
And my fears continue to haunt me
Along with the ghosts of highway twenty

Who I am now  is who I was then
I knew some how I'd come back again
No doubt about it, I'm next of kin
To all the ghosts along highway twenty
Run down motels and faded billboards
Used cars for sale and rusty junkyards
This two lane blacktop will never let me
Let go of the ghosts along highway twenty
And I have seen the signs that say
We're closing in on the final days
But I got nothing to repent
My saving grace is with the ghosts of highway twenty

Every question, every breath
Every exit leaves a little death
In its wake a memory
That will wander with the ghosts of highway twenty

And I have seen the signs that say
We're closing in on the final days

Outside playing barefoot in the street

Running and chasing after the ice cream wagon

On bad days she cussed when something got spilled
And Daddy taught the Bible, Lake Charles to Monroe
Shreveport to Slidell, Baton Rouge to Thibodaux
He chewed tobacco and spit out in a can
All the while hollering, ""Don't let the screen door slam""
Her daddy's kind didn't spare the rod
Blinded by the fear and the wrath of the Lord
He'd call her a sinner, say, ""you're going to hell""
Now finish your dinner and tell 'em you fell
And when the blood came
Her mama told her she was unclean
And her mama would scold her
Mama always felt Christian guilt
And then put to bed under a homemade quilt
God knows it rains in Louisiana

And God knows momma loved her daughter

Burn the palms of both my hands

If I could walk righteously again
I would sleep on a bed of nails
'Till my back was torn and bleeding

To save us all from Satan's slaughter
If I give up one of my lambs
Will you take me as one of your daughters?"

Carrying your pain in your back pocket
Like a sharp-edged knife
And somebody told me
There's the man you've been seeing
But I know he ain't your lover
And I know he ain't your friend
And I can tell by the way you look
You ain't been treating yourself right, girl
And you've been hooked
And if I could, I would I come to your side
I know you wouldn't want me to
It would only hurt your pride

Why do you act like you don't know me at all?
Why do you, why do you turn your face to the wall
Girl, don't try to run away like that
I know all about the pain
And all that jazz
You lean against the bar
With that look on your face
The leather's worn on your boots
And your blouse is tattered lace
You pawned your guitar
And you busted again
Your Chevy's broken down
And you're looking for a ride with him
You lie on your bed
And stare at the plaster peeling
And wonder where your spirit went
That wild, abandoned feeling
Everything you always knew about
Something you almost forgot
Hidden in a place somewhere
Deep down in your heart

I know all about the pain
And all that jazz
I know all about it
I know all about it, girl
I know all about it
I know all about it, girl
I know all about it
I know all about it, girl
I know all about it

Going down for the last time
Your heavy goodbye
Is sinking my soul
And I'm going down slow

But what used to be our future, has turned into my past
You're precious love line slowly slipping out of my hands

And I'm going down slow
Going down for the last time
Your heavy goodbye
Is sinking my soul
And I'm going down slow

There was nothing in your green eyes
To get me ready for the blue
I guess I had my head stuck in the sand
All your love and sweet lies, well I took them as the truth
And now I know how it feels to be a drowning man

And I'm going down slow
Going down for the last time
Your heavy goodbye
Is sinking my soul
And I'm going down slow"

Country,Jamey Johnson,2008,That Lonesome Song,In  Color,"I said Grandpa what's this picture here
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there, he said yeah, I was eleven
And times were tough, back in thirty-five
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm, in the Great Depression

And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color

This one here was taken overseas
In the middle of hell, in nineteen forty-three
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ole' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back, right through the day we left

And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color

And this one is my favorite one
This is me and grandma in the, summer sun
All dressed up, the day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile, I was so proud

That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white

And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color

Should've seen it in color"
Country,Jamey Johnson,2008,That Lonesome Song,High Cost of Living,"I was just a normal guy, life was just a nine to five
With bills and pressure, piled up to the sky
She never asked, she knew I'd been, hangin' with my wilder friends
Lookin' for some other way to fly

And three days straight was no big feat, could get by with no food or sleep
And crazy was becomin' my new norm
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
And sleep right through the calm before the storm

My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

That Southern Baptist parkin' lot, was where I'd go to smoke my pot
An' sit there in my pickup truck and pray
Starin' at that giant cross, just reminded me that I was lost
And it just never seemed to point the way

As soon as Jesus turned his back, I'd find my way across the tracks
Lookin' just to score, another deal
With my back against that damn eightball
I didn't have to think or talk, or feel

My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

My whole life went through my head, layin' in that motel bed
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door
I had a job and a piece of land, my sweet wife was my best friend
But I traded that for cocaine and a whore

With my newfound sobriety, I've got the time to sit and think
Of all the things I had, and threw away
This prison is much colder than
That one that I was locked up in just yesterday

My life is just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
Hell I can't even tell if I'm alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

I tell you, the high cost of livin'
It ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

I am reaching over Jordon
Take my hand, Lord, lead me home

All my burdens are behind me
I have prayed, my final prayer
Don't you cry, over my body
'Cause that ain't me, lyin' there, naw

You can't make a good livin' these days, 'cause the fruit just won't sell
So if you go out my backdoor, just over the hill
You'll see all these plants that's been payin' my bills

And when he goes to work they pay him for his time
Well the young boy gets to thinkin', and he heads up to his bedroom
Comes runnin' back with a quarter and four dimes

If I'm a little short then how much more does daddy need
To spend some time with me

The young boy tells his mama, now I know daddy's busy
'Cause most times when he gets home it's dark outside
But tell him I've got me some pennies, saved up from the tooth fairy
And I keep 'em in my piggy bank and I believe there's thirty-five

Is it enough to take me campin' in a tent down by the creek

To spend some time with me

Mama how much time will this buy me
Is it enough for just an afternoon, a day, or a whole week

An' lit it up like a 7-11
Yes, they fired the band that used to play
'Okie From Muskogee'
An' hired some dude with his hat on back'ards
Singin' hip-hop and karaoke

I should'a knowed it was gonna happen
Bein' this close to town
Aw but I know a beer joint back in the woods
That them city folks still ain't found

You make a right at the stump with the barbed wire in it
Where the old church used to be
Better mind that curve or the gravel gonna throw you
Right off in the Choctaw Creek
There's a one-lane bridge, just keep it in the middle
Pretty soon that road's gonna end
Welcome to Ray Ray's Juke Joint, down in the holler
Y'all come back again
Mmm-hmm

They got ice-cold beer an' chicken an' ribs
Cookin' on the grill out back
Three plays for a quarter on the jukebox in the corner
An' it's full of Hank, Haggard, an' Cash
They got a long-legged waitress wearin' cut-off jeans
She's quick to take your order
Better leave her a tip but don't give her no lip
Y'all that girl is Ray Ray's daughter

They'll make you feel like family
An' everybody is your friend
But there's been folks messed up down there
That ain't never been seen again

Country,Jamey Johnson,2008,That Lonesome Song,Mary Go Round,"Mary and I were the perfect picture of love
But my world started spinnin' around, 'til it wasn't enough
I tried to hang on to the heaven she made just for me
But when I slipped and fell it drove her to hell, and Lord knows that I hate to see

Mary go round, Mary go round
Mary I wish you'd stop takin' your heartache to town
Why can't you see that free love ain't free?
You'll spin 'til you fall to the ground, Mary I wish that you'd never found, the Mary go round

Now she's not the first to discover the devil's playground
But this ain't no game and these demons ain't playin' around
They'll make her believe they can drown all her pain with a drink
And if she sinks below it's burnin' my soul, to watch 'em all laugh as they sing

Mary go round, Mary go round
Aw, Mary, I wish you'd stop takin' your heartache to town
Why can't you see, honey, free love ain't free?
You'll spin 'til you fall to the ground, Mary I wish that you'd never found, the Mary go round

It's a paradise I find that sets me loose, ain't it the truth
It's a place out on the ocean, it's a mansion with a view
But all that I can think about is you

I been riding down a two-lane highway
For pretty much all of my life
Tryin' to do things my way
Wonderin' if I'll ever get anywhere but where I came from

And scare all the dragons away

When the only L.A. I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it
Why'd I ever wanna go so far?
Takin' depression pills in the Hollywood Hills
Actin' like I'm playin' the part

All this grippin' an' grinnin', an' bluesin' an' winnin' an' runnin'
And promises break like an egg on the hot asphalt
What the hell was I thinkin', drinkin' like I'd never get caught?
These high dollar women and the fame and the fortune, ain't worth the ticket I bought

When the only LA I knew
Was lower Alabama
Back when me and Hannah
Was wishin' on a southern star
Now it's so complicated, I really hate it

Country,Jamey Johnson,2013,Alabama & Friends,My Home’s In Alabama,"Drinkin' was forbidden in my Christian country home
I learned to play the flattop on them good ol' Gospel songs
Then I heard about the barrooms just across the Georgia line
Where a boy could make a livin' playin' guitar late at night
Had to learn about the ladies, too young to understand
Why the young girls fall in love with the boys in the band
When the boys turn to music, the girls just turn away
To some other guitar picker in some other late night place
Yeah, held on to my music, I let the ladies walk away
Took my songs and dreams to Nashville then I moved on to L.A
Up to New York City all across the USA
I lost so much of me but there's enough of me to say that my
Home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head
My home's in Alabama, Southern born and Southern bred
What keeps me goin' I don't really know
Can't be the money Lord knows I'm always broke
Could it be the satisfaction of bein' understood
When the people really love ya and let you know when it's good
Oh I'll speak my Southern English just as natural as I please
I'm in the heart of Dixie, Dixie's in the heart of me
And someday when I make it, when luck finds a way
Somewhere high on Lookout Mountain I'll just smile with pride and say that my
Home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head
My home's in Alabama, Southern born and Southern bred
Southern born and Southern bred

And my home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head

From that old maple guitar, and a good country song

I remember the dry heat, and the Mojave sand
Just me and that guitar, and some old marine friends
And about the only thing that got us through Twentynine Palms
Was an old maple guitar, and some good country songs

Lord that old maple guitar's got wood grains of gold
And that good country music, just pours from your soul
And it'll echo in the airways till god calls us home
With an old maple guitar, and a good country song
""Take her up boys""

I was stranded in Birmingham, and down on my luck
'Cause that wife took my money, and then a bank took my truck
Oh but, there's two things I still have, that they better leave alone
That's this old maple guitar, and these good country songs

Lord that old maple guitar's got wood grains of gold
And that good country music, it just pours out from the soul
And it'll echo in the airways till god calls me home

But I'm smilin' ear to ear

'Cause I'm mowin' down the roses
I'm mowin' down the roses

I poured out your purty perfume
Straight down the toilet bowl
And I ripped your face straight off the wall
Left nothin' but some holes

I loaded up your closets
Into fifteen garbage bags
And I smoked 'em with your potpourri
On a burn pile in the back

Now I'm mowin' down the roses
I'm mowin' down the roses
I'm mowin' down the roses

Tryin' on the wedding rings

'Cause gold just turns her green
I counted out the twenties
And I laid the money down
And we went straight
To the Davidson courthouse

After three long years together
She found a banker man
Said she was thinkin' about her future
And gave me back that silver band
I had it melted down
So i could wear in on a chain
Now it's a flyin' silver eagle
That used to be your ring

I'd rather have this silver eagle
Than all that rich man's gold
It's my one reminder of
A woman turnin' cold
Her love lies in his money
And mine's in a pair of wings
On a flyin' silver eagle
That used to be your ring

I couldn't put the past behind me
So I put it in a song
That's how I tell the story
How that woman done me wrong
Now I toured across the country
Ridin' high on the wings
Of a flyin' silver eagle
That used to be your ring

I'd rather have this silver eagle
Than all that rich man's gold
It's my one reminder of
A woman turnin' cold
Her love lies in his money
And mine's in a pair of wings
On a flyin' silver eagle
That used to be your ring

I met a homeless man on Broadway
He was holdin' out his hand
He asked me for a dollar
Said he was once a banker man
'Til that lady took his money
I said man I feel your pain
You might could use this silver eagle
You know it used to be a ring"
Country,Jamey Johnson,2010,The Guitar Song,That’s Why I Write Songs,"Have you fell in love, or you threw it away
You're lookin' for that perfect thing to say
And you're no good with words, well, that's okay
That's why I write songs

It might make you laugh, or make you cry
Might help you make it through a bad goodbye
'Cause you've been through it, and so have I
An' that's why I write songs

I remember all the times I felt
Like somebody knows me all too well
'Cause it was my life story, I was listenin' to
I don't know about you

But I've buried family, and a few good friends
And held a brand new baby in my hands
You see it ain't just what I do, it's who I am
And that's why I write songs

I remember how it blew my mind
When I played a song and watched a grown man cry
It was at that moment, when I just knew
What I was born to do

An' you know most songwriters, they don't ever get any fame
And hell most people don't even recognize their names
But chances are, you've probably sang along

To Harlan Howard, Bob McDill
Whitey Shafer, or my friend Whisperin' Bill
All the songs they wrote, they gave us chills
That's why I write songs

Don't forget Hank Cochran"

Oh, an' you don't really like none of my friends
You never really know just where I've been
When I slip up on your porch at 4 A.M
Like an old stray dog

So you scratch me, you pet me
And fight me and even let me win, now and then
You scold me, you tease me
Then you hold me and tell me I'm your friend

Well, makin' love to you, babe, ain't so hard
You treat me like a dog in the yard

Sometimes you kick at me when I'm down
And it drives you crazy when I just lay around
No matter what you do, I think I've found
A perfect home

'Cause you scratch me, you pet me
And you fight me and even let me win, now and then
'Cause you scold me, you tease me

'Bout when a poor man gets the blues

A rich man thinks his shoes were made
To walk wherever he wants
From the top of all them high-rise buildings
To the bottom of the honky-tonks
He'll step on everything in between
But he won't walk a mile in my shoes

And he don't give a damn
About a low class backwoods country boy
From deep South Alabam'
He uses folks like me
Just to keep his sorry ass amused
Well son, you'd better watch your back
When a poor man gets the blues

A rich man waltzed right into her life
Swept her off her feet
For all his fame and his fortune
Lord knows I couldn't compete
When he took her love away from me
I had nothing else to lose
So I taught that rich man just what happens
When a poor man gets the blues

He thinks his money rules the world
And he don't give a damn
About a low class backwoods country boy
From deep South Alabam'
He uses folks like me
Just to keep his sorry ass amused

Play what's still turnin' me on
Like that tight old-time rock and roll
Or that right-down-home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home

'Til I run out of time
I'm gonna spend the rest of mine

With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that just got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

And when my time on Earth is done
I want they write it on my stone
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own"

Chased a lot of crazy things
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 36
When you just remember half of it
You wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus

I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

In the mirror I saw my surprise
Who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head
That didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through it and say
""Slow down, honey.""

I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under

Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

Call it intuition, or call it crazy
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'll gladly stick around if we're together

Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?
And with you I'd like to live forever"

She left me hanging high and dry in that

We drove to the hospital in a hurry
Where my family gathered round my Grandpa’s bed
He was my best friend
He taught me how to fish
And I cried listening to my daddy pray
For one of those I’ve loved along the way
She had a ribbon in her hair the day I met her
That whole next year we couldn’t get enough
And after graduation she took off for Denver
And for a while we both tried to keep in touch
She was my best friend
And it broke my heart
But I don’t regret the day that she became
One of those I’ve loved along the way
And I hope they know
I never would made it this far on my own
Where would we all be without those
Fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
The friends I’ve made, the long lost lovers
I wouldn’t be who I am today
If not for those I’ve loved along the way
Along the way
Now I’m just a country boy with a guitar
Looking’ back down this old road I’ve been traveling’ on
It was never about trying’ to be some big star
For me it’s always been about these songs
You see they’re my best friends
They’re the life I live

Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
Well him and my uncle tore that engine down

He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road

They draft the white trash first, 'round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam

I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico

Really blew up, I didn't understand
Mama said,""The pistol is the devil's right hand""

The devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightning but she loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a Peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said, ""The pistol is the devil's right hand""

Well I get into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, I watched the man fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
My trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, ""Not guilty"" I said

And if I should die, I'd rise up to the sky
Just like Jesus, peace be upon him

A shadu la ilaha illa Allah
There's no God but God
We came to fight the Jihad and our hearts were pure and strong
And death filled the air, we all offered up prayers
And prepared for our martyrdom
Ah, but Allah had some other plan, some secret not revealed
Now they're draggin' me back
With my head in a sack to the land of the infidel

Country,Steve Earle,1988,Copperhead Road,Snake Oil,"Ladies and gentlemen, attention please
Come in close so everyone can see
I got a tale to tell, a listen don't cost a dime
And if you believe that we're going to get along just fine
Now I've been traveling all around
I heard trouble's come to your town
I've got a little something, guaranteed to ease your mind
It's called Snake Oil y'all, it's been around for a long, long time
Well, your crops'll burn if it don't rain soon
Ain't seen a drop since the tenth of June
Well, I can open up the sky, people have no fear
If you ain't impressed yet, just tell me what you want to hear
Well, you lost your farm so you moved to town
You get a job, they shut the factory down
Now you sit around all day long feeling sad and blue
You need Snake Oil y'all, tell you what I'm going to do
I can heal the sick, I can mend the lame
And the blind shall see again, it's all the same
Well, ain't your President good to you
Knocked 'em dead in Libya, Grenada too
Now he's taking his show a little further down the line
Well, between me and him, people, you're going to get along just fine

Country,Steve Earle,1988,Copperhead Road,Nothing but a Child,"Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out across the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they traveled day and night
And precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when they came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And this miracle they prized was nothing but a child

And nothing but a child could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
So once again we all can be children for a while

Now all around the world, in every little town
Every day is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awes to find another chance allowed


Nothing but a little baby
Nothing but a child"
Country,Steve Earle,2011,I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive,God Is God,"I believe in prophecy
Some folks see things not everybody can see
And,once in a while,they pass the secret along to you and me
And I believe in miracles
Something sacred burning in every bush and tree
We can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing

Yeah, I believe in God, and God ain't me

I've traveled around the world
Stood on mighty mountains and gazed across the wilderness
Never seen a line in the sand or a diamond in the dust
And as our fate unfurls
Every day that passes I'm sure about a little bit less
Even my money keeps telling me it's God I need to trust


God,in my little understanding, don't care what name I call
Whether or not I believe doesn't matter at all
I receive the blessings
That every day on Earth's another chance to get it right
Let this little light of mine shine and rage against the night
Just another lesson
Maybe someone's watching and wondering what I got
Maybe this is why I'm here on Earth, and maybe not"
Country,Steve Earle,1988,Copperhead Road,Even When I’m Blue,"I've always heard that love is blind
But I know that there's another kind
Shines like a beacon in the night
And holds up in the morning light

Because in my dreams she travels with me when I run
And in my dreams she takes my hand
When I make my stand but morning always comes
And I know it's too good to be true
She loves me even when I'm blue

No one can say that I ain't tried
I keep on searching far and wide
Because I know she's out there somewhere now
I'm gonna track her down somehow


She loves me even when I'm blue"
Country,Steve Earle,2002,Jerusalem,Jerusalem,"I woke up this morning
And none of the news was good
And death machines were rumbling
'Cross the ground where Jesus stood
And the man on my TV told me
It had always been that way
And there was nothing anyone could do or say
And I almost listened to him
Yeah, I almost lost my mind
Then I regained my senses again
And looked into my heart to find
That I believe that one fine day
All the children of Abraham
Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem

Well, maybe I'm only dreaming
And maybe I'm just a fool
But I don't remember learning
How to hate in Sunday school
But somewhere along the way
I strayed and I never looked back again
But I still find some comfort now and then
Then the storm comes rumbling in
And I can't lay me down
And the drums are drumming again
And I can't stand the sound
But I believe there'll come a day
When the lion and the lamb
Will lie down in peace together in Jerusalem

And there'll be no barricades then
There'll be no wire or walls
And we can wash all this blood from our hands
And all this hatred from our souls
And I believe that on that day
All the children of Abraham
Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem"
Country,Townes Van Zandt,1969,Townes Van Zandt ,Waitin’ Around to Die,"Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I don't even know the reason why
But I guess I keep a-gamblin', lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

Ah one time friends I had a ma, I even had a pa
Well he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, headed down to Tennessee
Well it's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
Ah she cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
Well I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
It seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

Then a friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother did we fly
But the posse caught up with me and drug me back to Muskogee
And it's two long years, a-waitin' 'round to die

Ah but now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie
Ah his name is codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Well together we're gonna wait around and die
Yeah together we're gonna wait around and die"

The tears you tried so hard to hide are flowing
And a blind man with his knife in hand
Has convinced himself that he understands
I wish him well, Miss Carousel
But I gotta be a-goin'

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name

Well the lady's been told that all the gold
Is worth so much it can't be sold
No time to weep, she'll need her sleep tomorrow
When she carries her face to the market place
And bets it on the opening race
She can ring her bells, Miss Carousel
But her singing brings me sorrow

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
And I'll proudly call your name

Well, it's always done, every mother's son
Is shown that grown men never run
So they fight with all the might inside them
When the battle's been fought and they've all been taught
That the trick is just not being caught
Will you give 'em hell, Miss Carousel
When they're begging you to hide them

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name

When the need arose, your eyes fell closed
You clamped your fingers 'round your nose
Would you say that's any way to judge him?
Well, you haven't got the authority
To kill him in the first degree
But would you feel compelled, Miss Carousel
If you had something to begrudge him?


On a velvet beach far beneath the reach
Of those that come to pry and preach
The natural man that tried to stand is fallin'
Well how long will it be before he sees
You own his legs but his mind is free
Only you can tell, Miss Carousel
How long will he be crawling?

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name

Ah the castle wall's grown so tall
Seems there ain't no hope at all
To reach the top
Even though you stop for breathing
But I ain't gonna try to make you cry
The tear drops couldn't find your eyes
It's all been swell, Miss Carousel
But the time has come for leaving

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

Well there's lots of things along the road I'd surely like to see
I'd like to lean into the wind and tell myself I'm free
But your softest whisper's louder than the highway's call to me

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

All the mountains and the rivers and the valleys can't compare
To your blue lit dancin' eyes and yellow shining hair
I could never hit the open road and leave you lyin' there

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

Ah lay your head back easy, love, close your cryin' eyes
I'll be layin' here beside you when the sun comes on the rise
I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails and the lonesome blue jay cries

And all the things I'd hoped to say
Will have to go unsaid today
Perhaps until tomorrow
Your fears have built a wall between
Our lives and all that lovin' means
Will have to go unfelt it seems
And that leaves only sorrow

You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall some day?

Close your eyes and speak to me
Of faith and love, and destiny
As distant as eternity
And truth, and understanding
The wind blows cold outside your door
It whispers words I've tried before
But you don't hear me anymore
Your pride's just too demanding

You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall some day?

The end is coming soon, it's plain
A warm bed just ain't worth the pain
And I will go and you'll remain
With the bitterness we tasted
A mother's breast, a newborn child
A poet's tears and a drunken smile
Can't help thinkin' all the while
Their meaning won't be wasted

You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall some day?"
Country,Townes Van Zandt,1969,Our Mother the Mountain,Kathleen (1969 Version),"It's plain to see, the sun won't shine today
But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway
Maybe I'll go insane, I got to stop the pain
Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen

A swallow comes and tells me of her dreams
She says she'd like to know just what they mean
I feel like I could die as I watch her flying by
Ride the north wind down to see Kathleen

The stars hang high above, the oceans roar
The moon is come to lead me to her door
There's crystal across the sand
And the waves, they take my hand
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen"

Watch the petals dancing
See 'em twirl and sing
Now all your pride and prancing
How much does it mean?

Watch the petals start to fly
And then come falling down
Ah hear the wind begin to cry
As she sees 'em touch the ground

Ah, lady, like the flower fair
Some day you'll have to fall
And you can find me standin' there

Like clouds of fish, they fly
And all I need is a boat to take 'em home
And girls I see, and they see me
Then we say goodbye
All I need is a bed to call my own

Will his life be like mine?

Breath turns to melody
All I need gonna fall away like rain"

Cigar bands on your hand, your daddy's socks rolled down
Styx nose plugs and aviator caps with flaps that button down
Movie stars on Dixie Cup tops and knickers to your knees
Ah, do you remember these?
The hit parade, grape Tru-Aid, the Sadie Hawkins dance
Pedal pushers, duck tail hair, and peggin' your pants
Howdy-Doody, Tutti-Frutti, the seam up the back of her hose
Ah, do you remember those?
James Dean, he was keen, Sunday movies were taboo
The senior prom, Judy's mom, rock and roll was new
Cracker Jack prize, stars in your eyes, ask daddy for the keys
Ah, do you remember these?
The bogeyman, lemonade stand, and takin' your tonsils out
Indian burn and wait your turn and four foul balls you're out
Cigarette loads and secret codes and savin' lucky stars
Can you remember back that far?
To boat neck shirts and fender skirts and crinoline petticoats
Mum's the word and a dirty bird and a double root beer float
Moon hub caps and loud heel taps and he's a real gone cat
Ah, do you remember that?
Dancin' close, little moron jokes, and cooties in her hair
Captain Midnight, Ovaltine, and The Whip at the County Fair
Charles Atlas Course, Roy Roger's Horse, and only The Shadow knows

Now that you're gone
It's not nearly long enough
Still it seems too long

I gave up my name for you
Gave up my edge, it made me bleed

Our strange and beautiful lives
Fade and turn to dust

Well he couldn't ride or wrangle and he never cared to make a dime
But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the time

Tearing up the years

The rooms that look the same

On the side of the road?

Did you have to make a deal?
Or wrestle for control of the wheel

Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
On your way home
On your way home

Did it drop out of the midnight sky

Did you ever stop once to cry?
Was I worth it?

Country,Patty Loveless,1990,On Down the Line,Looking In The Eyes Of Love,"I wonder should I tell you
About all the crazy things I've ever done
I've been a rebel all my life
And when I should have stayed I tried to run
I was searching for an answer
In this world full of strangers
But what I found was never enough
Now that I found you
Looking in the eyes of love
Darlin you've been good to me
You are so much more than I deserve
I never thought that I would find
Someone who's so sweet and kind like you
Please believe me when I say
This time I won't run away
I swear by all of heavens stars above
Now that I found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Looking in the eyes of love
I can see forever
I can see you and me
Walking through this old world together
Oh my hearts found a home
I've been dreaming of
Now that I found you

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
My yearnin' heart keeps sayin', you're not mine
But my troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonesome all the time
Please take these treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday these crazy arms will hold somebody new
But right now I'm so lonesome I could die
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new

Frost is on the window pane
Trees are green, the bees are hummin'
But I'm freezing just the same

Can't put my finger on it
Where did we lose the flame
We'll both end up broken-hearted
If we don't find that fire again

Lately we've been missin' something
And love is wearing at the seams
And you say baby, awe, it ain't nothing
And that's exactly what I mean

Come every winter season
Most birds they fly away
It's warm down south, they got no reason
Why they should want to stay

When we take love for granted
We wind up empty handed

Love is wearing at the seams
And you say baby, awe, it ain't nothing
And that's exactly what I mean

Baby, turn off the TV
Come here and hold me tight
A little heat is all that we need
To bring love back to life

Maybe we've been missin' something
And love is wearing at the seams
And you say baby, awe, it ain't nothing
And that's exactly what I mean
Oh, that's exactly what I mean"

Said where yesterday meets tomorrow

Country,Marty Stuart,1989,Hillbilly Rock,Hillbilly Rock,"It comes from Mississippi, and down in Alabam
Creepin' like a fever all across the land
From deep in the Delta on the Louisiana shore
The people got to have it, they wanna hear some more
It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
Some say it came from Memphis down in Tennessee
Or it drifted in from Georgia about 1953
Just as long as it's greasy, as long as it's fast
As long as it's pumpin' honey, it's gonna last
It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
Way back in old Kentucky where the bluegrass grows
Through the Carolinas on them dirt red roads
Burnin' like a fire runnin' wild in the woods
From Arkansas to Texas, it sounds so good
It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
So when the heat starts to risin' and you gotta blow some steam
Take a ride down the river, you'll see just what I mean
The juke joint's jumpin', when that cat goes on
The whole place is shakin', there's a something goin' on
It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Country,Asleep at the Wheel,1973,Texas Gold,Letter That Johnny Walker Read,"Johnny Walker sat at a table in a bar
Minding his own affairs
Drinking his namesake over the rocks
He was drunk, too drunk to care
When a girl in the bar walked up beside him
And this is what she said
She said, ""A woman came by with a letter for you
And this is what the letter said""

Dear, John, please, Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they've gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said, the letter that Johnny Walker read

Then John, he got up from the table
Slowly, so slowly, he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife and little children back at home
And how his drinking had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off, off into that street light
And a vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
For you see, folks, it was him lying drunk there in the gutter, clutching in his little ol' hand
The letter that Johnny Walker read, and this is what it said

Dear, John, please, Johnny, please come home
Mm, I need your love and the kids, they've gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said, the letter that Johnny Walker read

Country,Lee Ann Womack,2017,"The Lonely, The Lonesome & The Gone","The Lonely, The Lonesome & The Gone","Nobody writes goodbye notes
And takes off to God-only-knows on trains anymore
And to tell you the truth
I don't really see much use in walking the floor

Old songs make it sound so cool
To be a half-drunk heartbroke fool
When that fool is you, it's not

And the only way this heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
Is the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone

There's a place down by the mall
But it ain't what you'd call a honky tonk
They got a new jukebox
Filled up with country rock
'Cause that's what folks want

I don't know why no one sings about
Drowning in pitchers and half-priced wings
And trying to wish back everything they lost

Yeah the only way this heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
Is the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone

He never sang about watching a Camry pulling out
Of a crowded apartment parking lot

But I guess in some ways every heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
There's the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone
There's the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone"

Back down where the well's run dry
There's a whole lot of lovin', the livin' comes cheap
Down at the bottom of the barrel with me
Come on
Get down
Come on, get down

So you miss the bliss of waitin' on nothin'
Knowing everybody's name
Simply to like driftin' before it was in vain
Ain't it worth the fall to lose it all?
All that weight on your heart
Listen to your spirit call

And every picture tells a story, but every story has two halves
I keep 'em separate in before-and-after piles
Somewhere in the middle is where mama lost her smile

Somewhere in the summer back in 1982
Daddy took a job in town and we all had to move
I feel like there's one missing, I've felt it for a while
One that's gonna tell me, how mama lost her smile

But you don't take pictures of the bad times
We only wanna remember all the sunshine
We don't live in pictures, this is real life
And they're about as different as black and white

I don't know why it matters, I just know it does
It's not like it'll change things to find out what it was
She would never tell us that just ain't her style
But I wish I knew the reason why mama lost her smile

But you don't take pictures of the bad times
We only wanna remember all the sunshine
We don't live in pictures, this is real life
And they're about as different as black and white

We're all a little older and we're all a little worn
We're all a little faded and we're all a little torn

But you don't take pictures of the bad times
We only wanna remember all the sunshine

Felt my heart beating faster
Every time it rang
Some things never change
That's why I didn't answer

I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a country song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, ""No more alcohol""
I bet you're in a bar
Cause I'm always your last call

I don't need to check that message
I know what it says
""Baby, I still love you""
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath
That's the only love I get
So if you're calling...

With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, ""No more alcohol""

Cause I'm always your last

Call me crazy but
I think maybe
We've had our last call

I bet you're in a bar

And if you notice somethin' missin' well it's me
'Cause I tried a new life
I cried and you stood by
Well here's a little magic thing I do...
Chorus:
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do, but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah that might be me, but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
You ever get the feeling that it feels like deja vu
Because some stranger feels like someone that you know
Might be the color of her lipstick or the smell of her perfume
That sends a shiver all the way down to your toes
Don't blink 'cause it ain't...
Yeah... what you think
It's just your heart playin' tricks on you
Chorus:
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do, but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes

I know that you've probably heard my name
Though we've not been introduced
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you

If you've got a minute
I'll buy you a drink
I've got something to say
It might sound crazy
But last night in his sleep
I heard him call out your name

This ain't the first time, he's done it before
And it's hard to face the truth
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you

I know love is a fragile thing
And I'm trying hard to make it last
But it ain't easy holding on to my dream
When he's holding on to the past

Just one more thing before I go
I'm not here to put you down
You don't love him and that's a fact
Girl, I've seen you around

You hold his heart in the palm of your hand
And it's breaking mine in two

Dodged deals and dangers
Searching for my own little piece
From the countryside to the slick city street

Been high and low, dear
Learned every which way of the game how
Some things do and some don't change
Safe to say that I'm still crazy over you
Your love, it gets me through
When I'm stuck in life's Krazy Glue

Ain't it funny how a little thunder
Can make you start to wonder
Should you swim or just go under
And ain't it funny how you learn to pray
When your blue skies turn gray
When there's nothing left to say
Shine on, rainy day

A friend once told me
He said, ""You sound so lonely
All these cheatin' leavin' done-me-wrongs
Have you ever heard of a happy song?""
Well, offended, I sat down my glass
Smiled and let the moment pass
Tab's on me if you think I'm lyin'
Laughin' ain't a pleasure 'til you know about cryin' well

Ain't it funny how a little thunder

I drove away without looking back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Going anywhere as fast as I can
Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this

I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you
These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of the breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
But I'm still a far cry from gone
Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line

Too late to change my mind

I’ve been sleeping with the devil, so it seems
I’ve been sleeping with the devil, arms around him tight
Breathing my hot breath upon his chest the whole long night
Get up in the morning, God knows I have tried
I’ve been sleeping with the devil by my side
Sunday morning singing, chicken getting fried
I missed it all by sleeping in, And I feel no light inside
I gave him all my heart’s blood
And he’s run off with my soul
I’ve been sleeping with the devil in control
I never let him know it, what it was all about
I hid behind that bar room wall and I pulled the stopper out
I let it burn down slowly then I followed on behind

Country,Lee Ann Womack,2000,I Hope You Dance,Why They Call It Falling,"It's like jumping it's like leaping
It's like walking on the ceiling
It's like floating
It's like flying through the air
It's like soaring
It's like gliding
It's a rocket ship you're riding
It's a feeling that can take you anywhere

So why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
I don't know

There was passion
There was laughter
The first morning after
I just couldn't get my feet to touch the ground
Every time we were together
We'd talked about forever
I was certain
It was heaven we had found


But you can't live your life
Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down

It's like a knife
Through the heart
When it all comes apart
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon
It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kind of like a grave
When he tells you that he's found somebody new

And why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know"
Country,Lee Ann Womack,2015,The Way I’m Livin’,Chances Are,"Chances are I took the wrong turn
Every time I had a turn to take
And I guess I broke my own heart
Every chance I had a heart to break
And it seems I spent my whole life
Wishin’ on the same unlucky star
And as I watched you ‘cross the bar room
I wonder what my chances are
Well, I know you’ve been around
And you’ve seen what you needed to see
And at night when you’re dreamin’
You’re probably not dreamin’ ’bout me
Oh, it’s safe to say I’ve stumbled
But I’ve managed to make it through this fall
As I take one step and then another
I wonder what my chances are
I have watched the world go by, hand in hand
And wondered why I’m still so alone
Could I lay down my foolish pride
And maybe finally find my heart a home
The band has started playing
A simple songs I used to know
And I take your hand and walk you out
Danced through the rhythm way down low
Every heart has got a story
Mine just has few more scars
But they could heal if you will hold me
And tell me what my chances are
Well, it could heal if you will hold me
And tell me what my chances are"

I no longer toss and turn at night
Or pray to God that he's alright
I could care less if he makes the rounds
He's someone else's heartache now

The things I say to just get by
The only way that I survive
I tell myself that I'm okay
No matter what my heart might say

I don't think about what might have been
I'm just glad I'm finally over him
I guess he's happy with the love he's found

He reached into his coat and then
He gave me a bottle full of something sweet
Said I’ll fill it up every time we meet
Oh mama the way that I’m livin
Lyin’ and a sinnin’ and I just change
Oh mama the way that I’m livin
If I ever get to heaven it’s a doggone shame
One little drop is all it took
To get my name in his book
Now I sleep all day and I’m out all night
And I can’t tell wrong from right
You know I’d change if I could
But being bad, it feels so good
Oh mama the way that I’m livin
Lyin and a sinnin and I just change
Oh mama the way that I’m livin
If I ever get to heaven it’s a doggone shame
On the day I die when they lay me down
I know where my soul is bound
And don’t you cry, and don’t you weep
Cause it’s too late to rescue me

Get down on your knees

I don't need to go down

I wonder about these walls of yours and mine
They could repeat any number of things
They've heard and seen in their time
All of the angry words spoken
Then the silence that follows for days
Oh, that leaves a home feeling broken
Lord, if these walls could talk, they'd pray
If love lived here you couldn't tell
Five thousand square feet of living hell
And two hearts that need to be saved
It all died here of pure neglect
Is it too dead to resurrect
Lord, if these walls could talk, they'd pray
Two metal hands folded tight by her bed side
Asking Jesus, ""Will my family be ok?""
A child of five is just too small
Her prayers alone can't save us all
Lord, if these walls could talk, they'd pray
If love lived here you couldn't tell

Get up, get up, get up in Jesus' name
The Lord is calling daily to those who would be saved
Don't go down defeated while victory's here to claim
Get up, get up, get up in Jesus' name
At the gate called Beautiful
There laid out in the street
A poor and lowly beggar
Who was crippled in his feet
As John and Peter passed him
They saw his need was bad
They had no gold or silver
But they gave him what they had
CHORUS
In the day in which we live in
There's evil everywhere
The body seems discouraged
And overcome with fear
Well, God is needing soldiers
To get out of the pews
And take a hold of the power
That John and Peter used

I know what you've got
Go ahead and give it a whirl

Four-wheeling in the woods
Will she get her hands greasy
Up underneath the hood
I bet she never listens to Merle

Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light
Few were at the scene but they all did agree
The slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""Son what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me"

No Vacancy, No Vacancy
All along the line, it's the same old sign waitin' for me
No Vacancy, No Vacancy
And my heart beats slower when I read on the door ""No Vacancy""

Many was the happy dream I dreamed
Of a little nest where I could rest when the world was free
Now the mighty war over there is won
Troubles and trials have just begun
Facing that terrible enemy sign, ""No Vacancy""

Better take a moment on your knees
And thank the Lord above for all His love, then think about me
Livin' in a world of greed and hate
Hopin' every day that the hand of fate
Will remove that sign that's a-hangin' on the door, ""No Vacancy.""

And looked me in the eye
And said ""Son, I know what you're going through
You ought to get down on your knees
And thank your lucky stars that you got someone to go home to.""

You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
Till you lived through the story
That's still livin' in me
And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone
So I brought these pretty flowers
Hoping you would understand
Sometimes a man is such a fool
Those golden words of wisdom
From the heart of that old man
Showed me I ain't nothing without you
You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
Till you lived through the story

Shows no mercy
It has no rules
It's all the same for the kings and fools

And I'm hell bent on a heartache
I should know better
But I guess I don't
I keep on learning the hard way
Every time I turn around
I make the same mistake
Cause I'm hell bent on a heartache
Hell bent on a heartache

Seems I'm always getting burned
Just you wait until the table is turned
Love's a gamble
Love's a curse
Love's a bitch

I believe in love
Sometimes that's just not enough"

Than bacon & lettuce & homegrown tomatoes

Plant 'em in the spring, eat 'em in the summer
All winter with out 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' and diggin'
Every time I go out and pick me a big one
Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things that money can't buy
That's true love and homegrown tomatoes
You can go out to eat and that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with egss, eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side, put 'em in the middle
Put a homegrown tomato on a hotcake griddle
If I's to change this life I lead
I'd be Johnny Tomato Seed
Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetary
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes"
Country,Guy Clark,2013,My Favorite Picture of You,Rain in Durango,"She's a long way from Houston
Long way from those Texas blues
And she came down from Telluride
On a steam train bound for somewhere new
There's a rainbow in the mountains
And she's waiting on the sun to shine on through
You can't tell the tears from the rain
If you ain't walked a mile in her boots

Standing in the rain in Durango
Right side of wrong, wrong side of gone
Standing in the rain in Durango
She's waiting on some cowboy
To lasso her heart and take her home

Fell in with some field hippies
Went needle dancing in a tie dye dress
Then a Rocky Mountain rain came
And they all got soaking wet
She wound up with a backstage pass
Hanging with the pickers in the band
Until her heart got broke by a banjo man
Now she's had all the bluegrass she can stand

She had all of her belongings
In a cardboard suitcase sitting by her side
And she had no destination
She was just looking for a ride
So he pulled up in a Mustang
She got in and they just rode away
Headed west into the sunset
Mascara running down her face

She had all of her belongings
In a cardboard suitcase sitting by her side

Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
""I wonder, Lord, has every well I've drilled gone dry?""
We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train
Well, he's a drifter an' a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He taught me how to drive his car when he w's too drunk to
Oh, and he'd wink and give me money for the girls
An' our lives were like, some old Western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
An' from the time that I could walk, he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
An' there was old men with beer guts and dominos
Oh, an they're lying 'bout their lives while they played
An' I was just a kid, that they all called his sidekick
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
An' he's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
Well, to me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men?
He's drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like a desperado waitin' for a train
Like a desperado waitin' for a train
An' then the day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
Come on, Jack, that son-of-a-bitch is comin'
We're like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

On the north bank of the mighty Rio Grande
I was watchin' the jungle fires a-burnin'
Across the border of a not-so-distant land
And the echoes of the church bells that were swingin'
Could be heard from Guadalupe Market Square
There was a girl down there on the south side of the river
She had feathers tied into her long black hair

And if I was I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you

I put on my favorite jacket for Jamboozie
I painted up my eyes and wore my beads
There was a band playin' ""To God Be the Glory""
There were people dancin' all around the street
There were barrels on the sidewalk that were burnin'
And a fortune-teller readin' people's hands
And I swear, I heard those church bells ringin'
'Cross the border of a not-so-distant land

And I heard the groans of the dying
But, I didn't hear nobody pray

There's a bright and a sunny side, too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side

It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
The storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherished so dear
Clouds and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us every one in his care
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way

The initials of my name

And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss, or Disney Land
Or Mother Goose or nursery rhymes
God didn't make those little green apples
It don't rain in indianapolis in the summer time
And when myself is feeling low I think about her face aglow
To ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And asked her if she can get away and meet me
And grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doing hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way
And if that's not loving me all then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And It don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make believe
Puppy dogs, or autumn leaves, no BB guns

And stay there, sweetheart, for always


I hope you feel the same

My love is only for you
I'll never be blue
If I can be with you always"

I'd fight in wars, do all the chores

I want them to live on
Till they're called

I owe them my all

And Little Red Riding Hood was scared as a mouse
And, just like her, I'm scared through and through
That some two-legged wolf would run away with you
So, run 'em off
No use to talk all day
Run 'em off
They're trying to get you to play
Run 'em off
Make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I'll swear you're cheating on me
Now there's an iceman, milkman, and folks out of town
They don't come to visit, they just hang around
They act just as friendly as can be
But I don't think they care a thing about me
So run 'em off
Don't talk too long
Run 'em off
So we can be alone
Run 'em off
And make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I'll swear you're cheating on me
No matter where you are or what you do
Folks all a-whistle and howl at you
When they get too close then I want to say, shoo
'Cause it looks like they want to take a bite of you
So run 'em off
Don't talk too much
Run 'em off
You're gonna get in dutch
Run 'em off
And make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I'll swear you're cheating on me
Now once I ended this song but I'll write some more
'Cause there's a half a dozen wolfs coming up to my door
I can tell by looking, 'cause it's plain to see
That they're not here to make eyes at me
Run 'em off (run 'em off)
Don't want them hanging around
Run 'em off (run 'em off)
You'll be the talk of the town
Run 'em off (run 'em off)
And make 'em let us be

Aw, pick it out, Smitty!

Now darling, you know I love you well
Love you more than I can ever tell

I went to bed so sad and blue
Then, I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
And then we met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
""I don't believe you've met my baby""
You looked at him, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on his shoulder
You smiled at him, he smiled at you
His eyes were filled with victory
He said, ""My sister wants to marry""
Then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me"
Country,Tom T. Hall,1975,I Wrote a Song About It ,I Like Beer,"In some of my songs I have casually mentioned
The fact that I like to drink beer
This little song is more to the point
Roll out the barrel and lend me your ears

I like beer it makes me a jolly good fellow
I like beer it helps me unwind
And sometimes it makes me feel mellow
(Makes him feel mellow)

Whiskey's too rough, champagne costs too much
Vodka puts my mouth in gear
This little refrain should help me explain
As a matter of fact I like beer
(He likes beer)

My wife often frowns when we're out on the town
And I'm wearing a suit and a tie
She's sipping vermouth and she thinks I'm uncouth
When I yell as the waiter goes by



Last night I dreamed that I passed from the scene
And I went to a place so sublime
Oh, the water was clear and tasted like beer
Then they tur
Ned it all into wine"

You broke me heart my little darling
When I called for you, you had another there

You made me forget of all the others
You made me forget of all the past
And I thought sweetheart you really loved me

Said California is the place you need to be

Standing out upon the hill 'neath the shadow of the tree
If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill
Oh I want to wander back to the cabin on the hill
'Neath the shadow of the tree I would like to linger still
Just to be with those I love joy my heart would over fill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill
But the saddest of it all I can never more return
To that happy childhood home matters not how much I yearn
If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill"

She looks down her nose at money
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny
She's my baby
I'm her honey
I'm never gonna let her go

He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
He's my baby
And I'm his honey
I'm never gonna let him go

In spite of ourselves
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds
Honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
Dancin' in our eyes

She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs
She takes a lickin'
And keeps on tickin'
I'm never gonna let her go

He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a whacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon
He's my baby
I don't mean maybe
Never gonna let him go


In spite of ourselves"
Country,John Prine,1971,John Prine,Angel from Montgomery,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning, thunder were desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen. I can hear 'em, they're buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go"
Country,John Prine,1971,John Prine,Sam Stone,"Sam Stone came home
To his wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas
And the time that he served
Had shattered all his nerves
And left a little shrapnel in his knee
But the morphine eased the pain
And the grass grew round his brain
And gave him all the confidence he lacked
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm....

Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime
And Sammy took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime
And the gold rolled through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearin' other people's clothes

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm....

Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair
Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air
But life had lost its fun
And there was nothing to be done
But trade his house that he bought on the G. I. Bill
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes' hill

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm ...."

Until you've watched the shadows cross the ceilin'
Well I don't know, but I can see it snowin'
In your car the windows are wide open

Just come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to

Valentines break hearts and minds at random
That ol' Easter egg ain't got a leg to stand on
Well I can see that you can't win for tryin'
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryin'

Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to
Be alone

The moon and stars hang out in bars just talkin'
I still love that picture of us walkin'
Just like that ol' house we thought was haunted

Gonna buy a ticket to ride
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me
'Bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing a song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Go down where the people say ""y'all""
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game
And start playin' again
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again
Might go back down to Texas
Might go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song
Start singin' again
I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers
To questions that I already know
I could build me a castle of memories
Just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes
To get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station

Country,John Prine,1978,Bruised Orange,Bruised Orange (Chain Of Sorrow),"My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley
Like a long ago Sunday when I walked through the alley
On a cold winter's morning to a church house
Just to shovel some snow
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked gettin' neutered
An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter
Just from walking with his back turned
To the train that was coming so slow
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder
Throw your hands in the air, say ""What does it matter?""
But it don't do no good to get angry
So help me I know
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrow
I been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there
I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair
And my head shouted down to my heart
""You better look out below!""
Hey, it ain't such a long drop don't stammer don't stutter
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter
And you carry those bruises
To remind you wherever you go"

I was drowning in the sea, lost as I could be
When you found me with your boundless love

Sometimes my ol' heart is like a washing machine
It bounces around 'til my soul comes clean
And when I'm clean and hung out to dry
I'm gonna make you laugh until you cry

Surround me with your boundless love
Confound me with your boundless love
I was drowning in the sea, lost as I could be

A-falling from this jagged cliff

It was me that she was trying to blame

And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But it's far, far from me
Well, I leaned on my left leg
In the parking lot dirt
And Cathy was closing the lights
A June bug flew from the warmth he once knew
And I wished for once I weren't right
Why we used to laugh together
And we'd dance to any old song
Well, ya know, she still laughs with me
But she waits just a second too long
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But it's far, far from me
Well, I started the engine
And I gave it some gas
And Cathy was closing her purse
Well, we hadn't gone far in my beat old car
And I was prepared for the worst
""Will you still see me tomorrow?""
""No, I got too much to do.""
Well, a question ain't really a question
If you know the answer too"
Country,John Prine,1995,Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings,Lake Marie,"We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh
Many years ago along the Illinois-Wisconsin border
There was this Indian tribe
They found two babies in the woods, white babies
One of them was named Elizabeth
She was the fairer of the two
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie
Having never seen white girls before
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes
They named the larger and more beautiful Lake, Lake Elizabeth
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway
Became known forever as Lake Marie
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh
Many years later I found myself talking to this girl
Who was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie
The wind was blowing especially through her hair
There was four Italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill
And man, they was sssizzlin'
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada
Trying to save our marriage, and perhaps catch a few fish
Whatever seemed easier
That night she fell asleep in my arms
Humming the tune to 'Louie Louie'
Aah baby, We gotta go now
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh
The dogs were barking as the cars were parking
The loan sharks were sharking the narcs were narcing
Practically everyone was there
In the parking lot by the forest preserve
The police had found two bodies
Nay, naked bodies!
Their faces had been horribly disfigured by some sharp object
Saw it on the news
On the TV news
In a black and white video
You know what blood looks like in a black and white video?
Shadows, shadows that's exactly what it looks like
All the love we shared between her and me was slammed
Slammed up against the banks of Old Lake Marie, Marie
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa Wah Oh Wha Oh

All around the schoolyard playing all the games
Running, laughing back and forth the kid with two first names
Stranger in the closet, lock the diary
The past is running faster singing harmony
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
""God bless this kitchen"" said the knick-knack shelf
""The dinner's almost ready Go and wash yourself""
Jimmy's growing up now and Wanda's growing old
The time is growin' shorter the nights are long and cold

Sneaking in the closet and through the diary

Seems like everything I do just turns out wrong
Why don't you come on out and despise me
So I could pack my bag and baby, I'd be gone
Remember when you used to call me honey
I'd turn around and call you honey too
You might think it's a joke, but it ain't funny
To hurt someone who's so in love with you
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town
My body's in this room with you just catching hell
While my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell
You might think I'm listening to your grocery list
But I'm leaning on the jukebox and I'm about half ... way there
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town
I'm sittin' on a chair just behind my ear
Playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer
When you get done talking I'll come back downstairs
And assume the body of the person you presume who cares
I'm across the river on the other side of town
In my mind I'm on the other side of town
In my mind I'm going to the dog racing side of town"

On the tin roof
Hardly
A sound was left
From the birthday party
The kitchen light
Fell asleep
On the bedroom floor
Me and her were talking softer
Than all the time
Before I lost her
Picture sat on top
Of the chest of drawers
One red rose
In the Bible
Pressed between
The Holy alphabet
Probably wouldn't believe you
If you told me
But what I never knew
I never will forget
Rainy nights
Get dark real early
Her dress was soft
And her hair was curly
We danced around the table
To the old banjo
Rainy nights
Were made for lovers
We lay there still
Beneath the covers
And I ain't never felt
Like that before"

Runnin' through sky of blue rollin' in the sun
Every day has a way of overflowing one
Shoot the moon right between the eyes

On the corner of Third and Green
Two cars collided and I got excited
Just being part of that scene
It was Mrs. Tom Walker and her beautiful daughter
Pamela, was driving the car
They got hit by a man in a light blue sedan
Who had obviously been to a bar
They don't know how lucky they are
They could have run into that tree
Got struck by a bolt of lightning
And raped by a minority
It was a four way stop dilemma
We all arrived the same time
I yielded to the man to the right of me
And he yielded it right back to mine
Well, the yield went around and around and around
Till Pamela finally tried
Just then the man in the light blue sedan
Hit Pamela's passenger side
They don't know how lucky they are
They could have run into that tree
Got struck by a bolt of lightning
And raped by a minority
Pamela hit her head on the mirror
Mrs Walker got a bump on the knee
The man hit himself in the face and said
""Why does this happen to me?""
Then the neighbors came out and they gathered about
Saying ""Hey, who hit who anyway?""
And the police arrived at a quarter to five
And pronounced all the victims okay

Country,John Prine,2005,Fair & Square EP,That’s How Every Empire Falls,"He caught a train from Alexandria, just a broken man in flight
Runnin' scared with his devils, sayin' prayers all through the night
But mercy can't find him, not in the shadows where he calls
Forsaking all his better angels: That's how every empire falls

The bells ring out on Sunday morning like echoes from another time
All our innocence and yearning and sense of wonder left behind
Oh gentle hearts remember, What was that story? Is it lost?
For when religion loses vision, That's how every empire falls

He toasts his wife and all his family, the providence he brought to bear
They raise their glasses in his honor although this union they don't share
A man who lives among them was still a stranger to them all
For when the heart is never open, That's how every empire falls

Padlock the door and board the windows, put the people in the street
""It's just my job,"" he says, ""I'm sorry,"" and draws a check, goes home to eat
At night he tells his woman, ""I know I hide behind the laws""
She says, ""You're only taking orders"": That's how every empire falls

A bitter wind blows through the country, a hard rain falls on the sea
If terror comes without a warning, there must be something we don't see
What fire begets this fire, like torches thrown into the straw?
If no one asks, then no one answers: That's how every empire falls"

Should have her head examined
By an x-ray machine

I got to reach out and hold your hand in mine, feel your love baby one more time
Press against your lips and hold you tight, I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
I could put it off for another day, act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
Reach out and hold your hand in mine, feel your love baby one more time

She had a bad day

Next thing she had to say
Was honey I want you

Yeah she needs me by her side
So blue
I can hear the tears in her eyes
Lord knows I need this job
There's bills to pay

Crank up my pick-up
Drive off like a madman

Wrap her up tight

I rest my head next to the most beautiful thing you've ever seen
Lord only knows what she means to me
Solid as the rock on her left hand
She's proud to be my woman, that's why I'm proud to be her man
She's flowers in her hair on Sunday morning
And she's a Bud Light in her hand on Friday night
She's cornbread in the oven
She's wild and crazy loving me just right
Oh you know that's right
She ain't afraid to put me in my place
She ain't afraid to love me every night so every day..

She can rock a dress in cowboy boots, make a rolling stone wanna plant some roots
She's the one thing that I can't afford to lose
So I try to beat the morning sun out of the bed
Man I work like hell til the sun goes down and then

Where cowboys are king

Runs the horses down, turn 'em out, head over to the bar
There'll be George Strait on the jukebox, and I'll bet the chances are
There'll be some cowgirls in well-worn jeans
Where cowboys are king

I get back there every now and then

'Bout who he was, and who I am
That I never had, I just wouldn't listen

The birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own

You can't be happy when you're all by yourself
Go on, tell me I'm wrong (You're wrong)
When someone takes you down from the shelf
And plays with you some, it's wonderful (Wonderful)

Knew it was gonna be a long night

We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again

I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

Blew me away

Bent my heart back to your bedside

Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for

Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives
I broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free

Hell, I don't care, It ain't here nor there, just as long as you're by my side

Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides

So we hit that ground a running, throwing caution to the wind
And it wasn't long before that drink was gone, and she was shakin' that ass again
She said find somewhere dark where we can park, and put a hurtin' on this bottle
So we said goodnight to the city lights, kicking it in full throttle

Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat

Whether it's in park or it's in drive

But it was, ""Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules""

I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
And some of them, I'll never understand

But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You sent me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom, off the deep end
I got my reasons

I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

Some are true and some are sad
Everyone's got some, but I need one that brings you back

But it's never your voice on the end of the line

Hold my breath every time a car drives by

I caught a glimpse of you in Dallas gettin' off a plane

They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory? yeah

Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory"

'Cause I've already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl, it is what it is
I won't waste a dime
Or the bartender's time
Trying to catch a buzz
Over the thought of us

But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart

Cause I'm drinking to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'm raising my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey
Cheers to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And, yeah, I'm raising my glass to those savin' our ass overseas
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down

Made me who I am, you know who you are

""See you in five,"" but, baby, this time

Ain't gonna lie, if you knock on my door
I'm gonna let you walk in
Let you leave drunk lipstick marks like tattoos on my skin
But you know in the morning
We're gonna regret everything we did
So why even start what ain't good for our hearts

Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand

Keep chasing the night like you always do
Keep letting the good times play

Looking like a million in a dress from Target
The reason why every head in the whole room turns
That's her
Red light little white Honda
Strawberry blonde that she got from her mama
Blowing out the window then she's gone in a beautiful blur
That was her

That cheap box wine, she's drinking it
Friday night, she's bringing it
Old school song, she's singing it
Dust on the bar, wrong words, that's her
That lights down, hair down heart attack
Yeah, that's her, oh but that
How'd I ever meet her?
Wrapped around her little finger, that's me
Just lucky to be with her

That girl at the concert dancing
Clapping with her flip-flops, feet in the grass
Yeah, the only band anybody's watching is the one on her shirt
That's her
That girl that girls wanna hate
All the boys wanna date
They can't 'cause I ain't
Never ever gonna give her a reason to leave

Looks like we're gonna get all kinds of crazy

We'll be up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me up

You're up on the tailgate, you're up on a 3 beer buzz
You're up like the music pumping out of the cab of my truck
Up where the city lights can't help but get, get outshined
By the blue jeans and brown eyes I pull in closer

The first time I touched you, that's when I knew

I want you trust me, I want you to love me
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about
All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you

When you get rattled, or you're coming all unraveled
When your holding everything together for me
The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me
The way you know I'm holding something inside
Don't know what time has for us
But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of

Just bare footing around
I said, ""What's up?"" She hopped in the truck
And we were right away running the town

She's the kinda girl that walks in to your lonely world
And everything dark just lights up
But all summers end, now she's gone with the wind
And the reason I spend so many nights up

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
This party, this party wa-wa-wasn't over

I still hear her laughing like it just happened
Like I was just with her here
Well, she had the magic and I had the habit
But then she just disappeared

See, I'm the kinda guy that just can't get her off my mind
No matter how hard I try, she's all I think of
Another lesson learned, but hey, the world still turns
So I guess it's time to turn another drink up

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over

These days, I can't even hear a wave crash
And I get carried away and go George Strait back
To a slow dance out in the sand
When the keg was still cold and she was holding my hand

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over

No, it wasn't over

She got me rockin' my world no stopping kind of hot and heavy
Yeah whenever she's ready, and right now she's ready

I'm ready, she's leaning into me
I'm reaching for the keys to my Chevy
Little whisper in my ear, gotta get her out of here

She's ready

And I knew when you would flip the console up
And move my daddy's gun
I knew when the road turned to dirt
That we you were in the clear
You went to pullin' on my shirt
Poppin' buttons in my beer

You're like a wild fire in a runaway wind
I'm just a silverado cowboy who tryin' to rope you in
When you're lookin' that way it ain't much left to say
So baby do your thing

The way you're lookin' in my eyes
With your hair falling down
Way out here high on this hill
With the lights off and the back drop of our little town
Baby it ain't no way I'm ever coming down
From the way you're loving me now
The way you're loving me now

Like you've been caged up for a long, long time
Like you've saving it all up
For a night like tonight
And I'm just the lucky one
To have you come all undone
Kissing me, loving me
Lay it all up on me girl

The way you're lookin' in my eyes
With your hair falling down
Way out here high on this hill
With the lights off and the back drop of our little town
Baby it ain't no way I'm ever coming down

Baby there ain't no way, no how
I'm never gonna slow you down
From the way you're loving me now

Last night's a movie playin' over and over
All in my head

We talked for hours, fell in love with everything you said
About our exes, about Jesus in between some sips
You said so sexy, with your lips about an inch away
You wanna kiss me, don't you, whaddaya say
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You got me thinkin' crazy, this ain't me, I know where it ends
And this has got too good to be true written all over it
I'm takin' this leap of faith, if I go down in flames
We made a memory that won't go away
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You sleep so pretty up against me in this truck bed
Your little hand's inside of mine, and it's a perfect fit
And I'm in love with you all over me in every way
And I wouldn't be sayin' this if you were awake

Said you missed me, I forgot how to breathe

Fast lane to that back road, eventually to that back door

I'm  out on my own and I'm a little bit faded
Don't  even know if I should even be prayin'
But it's all in my heart so I might as well say it then
I  hope you're listenin'

Before I lay my head down
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I got the Devil on me
So  Lord I'm prayin' now
Forgive me for my sin
Knowin' good and well I'll probably do it again
And be with them people lookin' down on me
But Lord don't ever let 'em put their hands on me
I turn them lights out, don't know if you can hear me up there
It's just another lost soul's prayer

I can see my mama now and my good girl at home
They're both on their knees, both by the phone
And I'm the reason for the tears in both their eyes
And I'm the reason they're beggin' you to just get me through this shit one more night

I'm out on my own and I'm a little bit faded

Country,Brantley Gilbert,2010,Halfway To Heaven,Country Must Be Country Wide,"I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind

Said I'm turning off the real life drive and that's right
Hitting easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts' farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bone fire , then call the girls
King in the can, and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
We learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
It ain't as funny how rumors spread
Like i know something ya'll don't know
Man this shit is getting old
Man mind your business watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud ass out
No time for talking ya'll ain't listening
Them old dirt road is what ya'll missing

And if its broke round here we fix it
See i can take ya'll where you need to go
Down to my hood or back in them woods
We do it different round here that's right

Raised on southern baptist morals
In a front row pew for the Sunday roll call

Bust a 12 gauge pump and not miss
A life without work that's just a myth
Never listen when they talking shit
My dad taught me how to stand my ground
Be a man boy and never back down
Don't start up something but if he's talking trash
You better throw the first punch and whip his ass
Now be somebody, make a name for yourself
Life is hard, you go through hell
There comes a time when you've got to slow down

How head over heels could a man be

We can't stop
We're just rocking with this moment
Let it ride

I know you're worried about tomorrow
The days and the miles
That are bound to come between us
Baby, we both knew this was gonna be tough
Let's make the most of every second we can borrow
And pray to God that what we got's enough
We're going to take it day by day, mile by mile
Bridge by bridge, yeah, smile by smile

It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets

Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars

And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true

It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets

To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill…

Yeah me and my daddy built my first car
Strung the motor up in a tree
We wore the beer box helmets with the eyes cut out rat racing them junkyard dreams

I'd take a Mountain Dew over a silver spoon any old day of the week
I didn't choose the redneck life the redneck life chose me
Aw get on it son

Now I grew up swimming in cutoff jeans
Down at the bridge at the castor creek
We bent our half bills as far as we could bend them
We spent the fall sitting high in a tree
Yeah hunting and fishing wasn't just a trend it was what we did to eat
I didn't choose the redneck life the redneck life chose me

We think we gotta have it
And I get it just like everyone does
But soon as we get it, we no longer want it
Cause it's already somethin' that was
Sometimes it's just nice to know
We can pack up our lives and go where there's

Nothin' new under the sun
The time's just the time
Got no one to be
Got nowhere to run
A chair's still a chair
The shade's still the shade
The life's still the life
We still got it made
A beer's still a beer
Rum is still rum
And there's nothin' new under the sun

It's crazy the attraction
In findin' satisfaction
In chillin' by a cooler all day
Any thoughts of runnin'
Drownin' in the hummin' of
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
The latest scores
The race the chores
The Bulls and Bears
It's funny how we don't care

Nothin' new under the sun

Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need

We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

I see me wishin' time would stop

Happen past midnight in a Sonic parking lot

I walked away from that without the scratches
Lord knows I deserved

Last night when I called you up
I'm sorry if I upset you
With all that missing you stuff
I was just too far gone and all alone
When that phone started calling your name
And I know it's against the rules, girl
But tequila makes me do dumb things
I was just drunk
Dialing your number
Hoping that you just might wanna come over
I might have said a little too much
You know I don't think before I talk
When I got a good buzz
Can't be held responsible for what I was saying
You know I say a lot of things
When I've been drinking
Yeah and I was drinking
Can't believe what I said
But at least I made you laugh
After all this time
Since we said goodbye
I'm glad I can still do that
Girl, I was just drunk
Dialing your number
Hoping that you just might wanna come over
I might have said a little too much
But I don't think before I talk

Can't be held responsible for what I was saying
You know I say a lot of things

That there won't be

Saw the girl of my dreams and, man, she made me nervous
So, I leaned on my buddy Jack 'cause he gave me the courage
I swept her off her feet, stole her heart and made her mine
She moved in and didn't like my friend Jack takin' all our time
She started gettin' jealous, said, ""Jack's got to go""
He just wouldn't leave, so my girl hit the road, and

She talks politics, art history
How she does it, it's a mystery
Cause when the girl starts talking to me
It's enough to drive a man crazy

She's Jekyll, she's Hyde
She's day, she's night
There's no blurring the lines
She's one or the other

She stop this rolling stone
She shook me to the bone, now I'm singing a different tune

And she's twanging on my heartstrings
I'm banking it's a love thing
Something bout that girl really rocks my world
And she's banging on my buttons
Saying sweet nothings
Like a guitar picker, strumming on my ticker
She twanging on my heartstrings

When I feel her touch
I get a crazy rush
Sometimes it's just too much
Gets the blood pumping through my veins
Oh


There's fire in her fingertips
The way she bends them strings
She yanks em, she cranks em
My baby spanks em all night long"

We ain't doin' something right
If we ain't hurtin' in the morning

I wanna see you shake it up on the bar, playing your chonged air guitar
I'll holler your name with my lighter up in the air
When the band dulls up a good slow jam, I'll hold you close and we'll make a plan
Call us a cab and slip on out of here (Let's go)



Find another party
Catch another groove
When the beer runs out
I got a bottle in my boot


When we open our eyes and we see the sunrise
Girl, that's when we'll come to realize
Heads will be thumpin', we won't remember nothing
It's a good night, but we'll be hurtin' in the morning

There's no need for me to hang around
I've gotta get out of town

Five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
Half empty plane on New Years Eve
Love birds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy
The pilot comes on, says the year is almost gone
Five, four, three, two, one
Looks like it's just me and the whiskey
Cause you ain't here to kiss me
You ain't here to kiss me

Raise a toast to the thought of you and me
This was just the way it had to be
90 proof to give me clarity
The flight attendant must know that somethings going on
Can't hide the look of love gone wrong
So she's pouring them a little strong

I thought that they needed me, but really they were leading me on
It gets old waking up with your head in a vice, feeling empty as a bottle of jack
But I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back
You get me high, you get me stoned, it's a ride I ain't never been on
It's a binge, it's a buzz, it's a drunk I can't find in no glass
Yeah, I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back
Bright lights, and guitars, and dive bars, playing for tips
And pouring your heart out to strangers, is a strange kind of fix
But filling a dance floor, is something I live for, but I give more than I'll ever get back
But I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back
You get me high, you get me stoned, it's a ride I ain't never been on

Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

Don't even know just the danger you're in cause you're so caught up in the moment
But you shoot a smile cuts through the smoke
Hits you before you even know

A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun

She's cold and she's hot
She's fun but she's not some play thing two dollar pistol
Say the right thing she'll go off with a bang
But be careful cause she kicks a little
Hold her just right don't let her down
You're gonna get hurt if you mess around

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

We got our own little groove

I don't wanna be a one man band

The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you

But I've kept ""I'm sorry"" locked in a vault
I know that time just keeps going on
And words by themselves can't right all the wrongs
In a world that's gone crazy, you don't know what's true
Most people don't change, but some people do

Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

Some people say sorry to hear it's okay
But I know it's not so you don't have to say
That you understand 'cause I know you don't
And neither do I, that don't mean that I won't
Try everyday to show you the truth
Most people don't change, but some people do

Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

So whether you kiss me or you close the door
Just know that I'm better than I was before

Dove in my front seat
Windshield full of road to run

Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash

We could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast
One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didn't care if we were spinnin' wheels

Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash

It's hard to keep my hands on the wheel when she's looking so fine
I ride down any back road that she wants me to drive
With the
Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind
Woah
I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight
Something about the sound of the gravel setting the mood
Is got me thinking I should park this thing underneath the moon
And wrap ourselves all around each other like a vine of kudzu
With the
Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind

Lucky stars are lining up

Turnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket
We're just little town livin' it up tonight

Key on the tree, you know the place
Last one in, don't forget the gate
Field full of Fords and Chevrolets, yeah
My kind of party
A little diesel on a pile of wood
Stir it up, get it burnin' good
She wants to dance like I knew she would
So let's get it started

Twist it off, turn it up, pass it around
No other place I'd rather be right now and

We're just little town livin'
When the sun goes down, we're gonna ride
Turnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket

Wrap your baby in your jacket, hold her real close
Watch the stars fall out of the sky
Ain't got a lot, but ain't a damn thing missing
We're just little town livin' it up tonight

Just some blue jean girls and Cali boys killin' some time
Walkin' the line and worry about nothin' tonight

Just little town livin'
When the sun goes down, we're gonna ride
Turnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket
We're just little town livin' it up
We're just little town livin' it up tonight

Country,Dustin Lynch,2014,Where It’s At,What You Wanna Hear,"I bet you're sick of them pick up lines, the same thing every Friday night
You're so hot girl, you're looking so fine, like you don't already know
They say they'll treat you right, show you the city lights
Get you sipping on something you don't even like
I guess they don't know, they're on the wrong road
I know what you wanna hear
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in
Hair all around to the sound
Of the radio singing in the background
Gravel grinding, while we're finding
A little spot I can make a fire in
Top popping on an ice cold beer
I know what you wanna hear
Ain't that music to your ears?
Tell me, have I got you figured out?
Baby, ain't that what you're all about?
Do I make you wanna leave this crowd and head on out of here
Cause I can tell by that little shine smile
What I'm talking bout's a little more of your style
It'll only take a couple of miles to the
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in

I grew up in, I used to run around
In a hand-me-down Chevy
This place is high rise heaven
And this sure ain't that little Main Street drag
With the courthouse square still flying the flag
No, it's a six-lane city
Long, long way from little bitty

Yeah, I'm just out here chasing these stars
And sometimes, I swear I'm living on Mars

But I grew up on a dirt road, watching that corn grow
Turning on a pretty thing parked on a turn row
Blowing that Swisher smoke out the window, oh
A six pack from the Bi-Lo
And I go back every time I get a minute
The biggest part of me is in them little city limits
Don't matter where I go
I damn sure let 'em all know
I grew up on a dirt road, a dirt road

I grew up on a dirt road dreaming 'bout making a name
And getting out of dodge and the same ol' same
Graduate and settle down
Man, I was out of that town
Now I catch myself rewinding, reminiscing
'Bout a small town girl and mama's fried chicken
I can taste it right now
Let me tell you I'm proud

That I grew up on a dirt road, watching that corn grow
Turning on a pretty thing parked on a turn row
Blowing that Swisher smoke out the window, oh

If the river gets much higher, they'll float away no doubt
You can almost feel it in the air, an American prayer
They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
Got faith in us, got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen
It echoes through the factories up in Michigan
It bounces off the levees, and rides out on the wind
Clear out to California, and back on up to Maine
Don't matter if you're rich or poor, a sinner or a saint
Every night, everybody, everywhere
Is praying their American prayer
They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
Got faith in us, got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen

To every part of your whole world
You think it's unthinkable girl
But somebody's gonna break those walls
Somebody's gonna watch you fall
Gonna give it your all and I hope that I'm around
When you finally find out why you

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two

I just wanna run, I just wanna run away with you

Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
‘Til we find the love we fell into
I just wanna run, I just wanna run away you
Yeah, I just wanna run away with you

And I miss your midnight kiss, loving you all night long

Caught up in the worry and always in a hurry and losing what we’re all about
Let’s slow it down
Take our love and get out of this town

Up on a mountain, down by the beach side

I wanna lay you down
With nothing but the sound of my name on your lips
We can let it all go
Pull real close and find that place again

You should be movin' slow in the neon lights
Held close with a kiss, feelin' right
'Stead of waitin' by the phone
Didn't he hold the door? Didn't he bring ya flowers?

Country,Michael Ray,2018,Amos,Summer Water,"Sometimes that lake got angry, as the lightnin' went and crashed
Sometimes it was so still, it looked like a sheet of glass
But it washed away our beer cans, and it washed away our sins
It talked us out of all our clothes, and begged us to jump in

There was magic in the summer water
Learned to swim in the summer water
All the small town sons and daughters
Were baptized a thousand times
Built fire by it like an altar
Gave it every song we could offer
Memories float on it like a bobber
Out there on the summer water

When a heart was broken, it was better than a church pew sanctuary
A lot of long kiss, rocks skip, sun drenched orange crush bottle caps got buried
It's where you spend your first night with your first love before the mercury starts fallin'
It's where you spend the last with your first love, before somebody goes to college

There was magic in the summer water
Learned to swim in the summer water
All the small town sons and daughters
Were baptized a thousand times
Built fire by it like an altar
Gave it every song we could offer
Memories float on it like a bobber
Out there on the summer water

There was somethin' 'bout the summer water
Every girl that's where you brought her
It's where you slipped that ring you bought her
On her shakin' hand
Built fire by it like an altar
Gave it every song we could offer
Memories float on it like a bobber
Out there on the summer water

Rainy days are just no good for leaving
No need in mixing misery and gin
So it goes for icy days
Heartache and slick highways
No time to wait, you're gonna break if you bend and bend again

But a fresh new start
Will warm your heart
Like the sun breaking through a cloudy sky

If ever was a good day
It's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a red-eye flight
Two tail lights in the night
Gonna spread your wings and fly
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a west-bound train
You're drinking cheap champagne
Got no more tears to cry
You're long gone like a whisper in the wind
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Bye bye
Bye bye

No need in naming names
Players love playing games
And he played your heart like a little violin
It's a brand new rhyme and riddle
It's your turn to play that fiddle
And that same old song and dance is coming to an end

'Cause a fresh new start
Will warm your heart
Like the sun breaking through a cloudy sky

If ever was a good day
It's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a red-eye flight
Two tail lights in the night
Gonna spread your wings and fly
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a west-bound train
You're drinking cheap champagne
Got no more tears to cry
You're long gone like a whisper in the wind
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Bye bye
Bye bye

If he really wants a goodbye kiss
He must be out of his ever-loving mind
Yeah if he really wants a goodbye kiss
You tell him to go kiss it where the sun don't shine

If ever was a good day
It's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a red-eye flight
Two tail lights in the night
Gonna spread your wings and fly
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye
Just like a west-bound train
You're drinking cheap champagne
Got no more tears to cry

You're out like a light, like a red-eye flight
Like two tail lights in the dust of midnight
He's out of mind, you're out of sight
That ship has sailed, that ship don't fly
You're gone like a train, like a west-bound train
With a one-way ticket, drinking cheap champagne
Flush it down the drain 'cause there's no more tears to cry
You're long gone like a whisper in the wind
That boy can kiss that girl goodbye"

Blaring on the speakers of my Monte Carlo
Down FM 109 on my FM Radio

Put it on cruise control
You know it's been a while
We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style singing
Singing ""Rebel Rebel"" at the top of our lungs
Out of town windows down playing those dashboard drums
Everybody said you'd never make it too far
With some poor boy playing on some pawn shop guitar
You know my crazy dreams
Were busting at the seams
Just like these old boots and jeans
We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going, never going outta style
We're never going outta style
I'll pop my collar do my best James Dean
We'll hit the road like a Steve McQueen movie scene
Show me your million dollar Marilyn smile
And I'll show you a love love love

Country,Aaron Watson,2019,Red Bandana,Ghost of Guy Clark,"The old man was sitting on the tailgate of a '62 Ford flatbed
Picking on an old guitar, he looked at me and said ""The engine’s dead""
""It was a good run son"", as he strummed a melancholy chord
""Now I've got nothing but time to kill until the coming of the Lord""

He played me a few songs, one about a Randall knife
One about a train, one about the pain of losing the love of his life
He took a puff of that cigarette, he blew a breath of smoke that could smother
He said ""They always said these would kill me and they did"" then he laughed and he lit another

He said ""I hear that you write songs boy, play me one that I might know""
So I sang him my latest greatest hit, a number one on music row
He stopped me before I could finish the verse, said ""I think I've heard enough of that
When you’ve heard one you've heard em all"", with a grimace of a grin he took his old guitar back

He said ""I guess that's alright if that's all you've got to give
If that's all you've got to say in this one life you've got to live
There’s no meaning in your melody so predictable and weak
Wasted words and shallow rhymes I’d rather hear a woman cuss me a blue streak

You see, the pencil to the pad is like the bullet to the gun
The pen is mightier than the sword if the words are forged from fire from the sun
Yet some do it for the fame, the fun, the money and all the glory
Yet some do it for their weary soul, won't rest until they tell their story

You gotta make ’em feel what you feel, help 'em dream a dream and make 'em wonder
It's like catch lightning in a bottle, make ’em smell the rain and hear the thunder
Let 'em taste the tears of joy or the bittersweet taste of sin
Find the passion in a four letter word or a Sunday morning Amen

And then he flicked his ashes and he pointed at my heart
Said ""if you're searching for solid gold, that'd be a real good place to start
Let the words speak for themselves, tell the truth, right or wrong
And bare your soul for all to see all for the sake of the song"""

Oh, she's got those strings around my heart
Oh, she has my heartstrings

I'm a trailblazer, stargazer, a rainbow rambler born to roam
But she's like no one I've ever known
She reels me in and gently brings me back home

Oh, she's got those strings around my heart, ah
Oh, she's got those strings around my heart
Oh, she has my heartstrings

I know it would break my heart if she broke that velvet line

And beware of those schemes
Stay razor sharp and find your mark
As you go chase your dreams
Watch out for those dangers
Always dancing in the dark
When the shadows of the nights shoot out the lights

Follow your arrow
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow
Be steadfast and steady
Always be ready
Aim for the stars and the sky
Take heart, pull it back and let it fly

Good things come to those who pray
So don't you chalk it up to chance
And never let your arrow be led by arrogance
Fill your quiver full of courage
Show this world you're heaven sent
Keep a good head on your shoulders
Every arrow needs a fine piece of flint

So promise me before you go
Follow your arrow
You will pray to never stray from straight and narrow
Be steadfast and steady
Always be ready
Aim for the stars and the sky
Take heart, pull it back
And let it fly on the wings of an angel
Let it fly with the grace of a dove
Through the lightning and thunder
Never aimlessly wander

He'd grown tired, his health was headed southbound
He was slow climbing in the saddle
But once he was up, he could fly
Lord, he could fly
He told me stories ’bout the California gold
Working with Shorty in that West Texas cold
He was rough as a cop, tougher than nails
But when he talked about her, he would cry
Oh, how he'd cry

And I learned how to rope and I learned how to pray
And how actions speak louder than any words you may say
Like busting bronc's, I’ve hung on for dear life
To everything that he ever said
Oh, and though he's long gone
I'm still out here riding with Red

I never liked or learned too much from school
He taught me the hard knocks and the Golden Rule
How to chew, how to spit, work hard and never quit
He gave me money so I could spend it on the girls

And I learned how to rope and I learned how to pray
And how actions speak louder than any words you may say
Like busting bronc's, I've hung on for dear life
To everything that he ever said
Oh, and though he's long gone
I'm still out here riding with Red
And I learned how to rope and I learned how to pray
And how actions speak louder than any words you may say
And like busting bronc's, I’ve hung on for dear life

A drifter with daredevil dreams
My illusion's delusion has come to conclusion
This world's not what it seems

There's no place like home sweet home
When I'm down on my luck, hungry, hard up and low
You keep the fire burning strong, you're my coat from the cold
Inside those windows and walls, you're the heart and the soul
You wash my worries away whenever I hear you say
""You will never be alone""
Wherever you are, you're never too far from home sweet...

Home is the sound of feet on the ground
Running in as you walk through the door
All the smiles and the laughter, the love that you're after
Is there as you kneel to the floor
When I'm gone for too long, you go leave the light on
Always waiting on me patiently
And time after time, when I'm out of my mind
You refresh my memory

'Cause there's no place like home sweet home

Put on your dancin' boots, slip your red dress on
And I'll pour the wine and play your favorite song
I wanna swing you round the kitchen floor
And leave a trail of clothes all the way through the bedroom door
I turn out the porch light
I want to take you home tonight

I wanna feel your heartbeat next to mine
I wanna feel your desire, then take you higher
Then those stars up in the moon light sky
We're gonna fly, we're gonna fly
I don't wanna leave this house
I wanna take you home
Don't wanna leave this house
I wanna take you home tonight

No, there ain't nothin' like a Sunday mornin' sunrise

There's no kids around, it's been a while
Since I've seen that come an get me smile
No, we don't have to go to Mexico
To find some getaway somewhere along the coast
'Cause right here is just right
I'm gonna take you home tonight

I wanna feel your heartbeat next to mine
I wanna feel your desire, then take you higher

Wanna taste a fine wine, wanna taste those sweet red lips
I wanna dance across your skin using my fingertips
You know I know you, but I wanna know you more

It's where love was born and loved ones are buried
A little church where we got married
Living life like a black and white movie
After all this time you still move me
Years and years of tears and smiles
Good memories go for miles

Tune out the world when it goes wrong
Don't you know that everybody dreams about what we found
A big love in a small town
It's a mom and pop corner shop five and dimer
My granddaddy bought my new old timer
A six pack and a pack of smokes
Peanut patties and cherry cokes
They roll up those sidewalks at night

Country,Aaron Watson,2019,Red Bandana,Blood Brothers,"We were just ten years old when we bonded for life
In that Maple tree, you and me, and my old timer knife
The trade we made with the blade sealed a deal like no others
Yeah, it hurt like hell but not a teardrop fell

We were blood brothers
Same soul with a different shade of skin
Blood is thicker than water
We were thick as thieves through the thick and thin
Growing up in a world calling us different colors
But it was more than black and white
Wish everyone would act like blood brothers

Remember when you busted up my lip and I dotted your right eye?
I liked your sister, so I kissed her behind the bleachers in junior high
Man you were red hot mad, we got suspended from school
And we spend the rest of the day fishing our problems away

'Cause we were blood brothers
Same soul with a different shade of skin
Blood is thicker than water
We were thick as thieves through the thick and thin
Growing up in a world calling us different colors
But it was more than black and white
Wish everyone would act like blood brothers
Blood brothers

When we learn to look through His eyes in heaven above
We'll see with all hate and heartache there's nothing stronger than love
When we learn to look through His eyes in heaven above
We'll see with all hate and heartache there's nothing stronger than love

We were blood brothers
Same soul with a different shade of skin

Country,Aaron Watson,2017,Vaquero,They Don’t Make Em Like They Used To,"Bluebonnets down a long stretch of hill country highway
Windows down, radio up, ride shotgun next to you
You were smoking Camel Lights behind the wheel I can still hear you say
Three hundred thousand miles you can't beat an ol' beat up Chevrolet

Well Granny's in the kitchen, smell of fried chicken frying
She's cooking in her apron singing along with Patsy Cline
Playing ball in the front yard, little sister runs in crying
She climbs up in her arms, I hear her laughing through the old screen door

They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like you anymore
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like you anymore

Well the days have changed since the golden days in some ways we've come so far
But I never dreamed we'd trade the American Dream for a fancy foreign car
Have we sold our souls to save a buck traded hard work for dumb luck
And those old country songs are sounding better than ever before

They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like you anymore
Now they don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like you anymore

So you live the kind of life so long after you're long gone
You'll always be there in their hearts and your love light will shine on
And someday they'll sit around down at John T's Country Store
They'll be laughing over stories you told a thousand times before, saying
Say it, they don't make 'em like you anymore
They don't make 'em like you anymore

They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like you anymore
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like you anymore

Well no news is good news, tell me whose news really tells the truth
The death toll rises high as gas prices shoot straight through the roof
Meanwhile politicians preach while some preachers politic
Well we need is lots of love, yeah, lots of love might do the trick
Instead we criticize, we glamorize who's right or wrong, who's left or right
Missing out on so many beautiful colors fighting over what's black and white
We've gotta forgive, gotta learn to live together, make the world a better place
And just maybe someday somebody somewhere will look back on today
Look back on us and say

They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like you anymore"

He's wearing his jersey with the same last name
A still reminder of the guy that ain't around these days

Saying 'run, baby run', she's his number one fan
Doing the best she can
But wondering why his daddy can't be a better man

He just wants to feel what kids feel
Walking off the football field
After winning, for a minute
In his daddy's pads
The kid should never have to wonder
If his old man even loves him
On a Friday night under Friday lights
Shouldn't be so sad

That should be his hero
That left him and his mama all alone
Barely even calls him on the phone
Every year in March, sends a birthday card
But he just needs a hero, mmm
Yeah, he just needs a hero

There's an old white haired preacher man
With a leather bind good book on the stand
Says 'if you're ready for a change, here's your chance
With every head bow, slip up your hand'

If you wanna feel something real
That this mean old world can't kill
Not even Satan
There's a saviour, he'll wash away your sins

You and me were rockstars

Oh yeah

Yeah, we were runnin' all night
Chasing down a dream
Howling at the moon
Baby, you and me"
Country,Kane Brown,2016,Chapter 1,There Goes My Everything,"Everything, everything, everything...
I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up
That girl comes without a warning
So addicting, I can’t get enough
She gets dressed for work, grabs her keys then she leaves
Yeah that goodbye kiss kills me
There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything
Everything, everything, everything...
Everytime we’re in a party
I still watch her from across the room
I ain’t notice everybody
They can’t even help but watch her too
Dressed up or dressed down
And she can’t help but shine
I can’t believe she’s mine
There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything
There goes my everything
Everything, everything, everything...
I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up
There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything
There goes my everything"
Country,Kane Brown,2016,Kane Brown,Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,"We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand

I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun is starting to peak
Through my window, lettin' me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting
And a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer
And a little something stashed
In the back of the car, so relax
There ain't a beach too far

We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now

Oh tellin', no tellin'
Bet them lips taste like watermelon
Got that Daiquiri kiss
The kind when it hits
Makes you wanna get goin' there
Wherever that is

We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand (hell yeah!)
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
No, there ain't no stopping us now
There ain't no stopping us now

Country,Kane Brown,2018,Experiment,Work,"They say don't go to bed angry
They say always kiss goodnight
Maybe there's somethin' to it
I don't know, but what if they're right
If we're gonna be forever
If it's gonna be just us
If we're gonna ride together
Turn two to one

Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

I've seen the things that happen
One side self destructs
I've seen the beautiful madness
When things erupt

Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

Can't always be there for ya
Can't always be by your side
But I promise that I'm gon' love ya
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take

Oh no, yeah, we can make it work"
Country,Kane Brown,2018,Experiment,American Bad Dream,"Remember when ninth grade was about gettin' laid
Skippin' class tryin' not to get caught?
Now you gotta take a test in a bullet proof vest
Scared to death that you might get shot
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth and I just can't take it no more

So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream

I remember goin' 10 over the limit would just get you a ticket
Just an inconvenience gettin' stopped
Bad cops played the jury, made the good ones worry
About showin' up and doin' their job
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth now I just can't take it no more

So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
Yeah this American bad dream
From this American bad dream, oh

It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
Damn

So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream"
Country,Kane Brown,2016,Kane Brown,Cold Spot,"A cement building
White cinderblocks
And faded red letters
The sign read ""cold spot""
He worked behind the counter
To them he was an old man
When my world was crumbling
My grandpa gave me his hand

It was crickets, minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the southern baptist bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter you saw it all
At the cold spot

It was cool in July, warm in December
If I live a hundred years, I'll always remember
The song and the hum to that old ceiling fan
And his north Georgia voice saying, ""Buddy, you can""
Out here, I'm just a kid trying to make a name
I am who I am because he raised Kane, selling

Crickets and minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the southern baptist bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter you saw it all
At the cold spot
Oh yeah
At the cold spot

It was crickets, minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It was heaven on earth when my world was hell
And the big stores came and the business failed
But all my memories are alive and well
At the cold spot
Oh yeah
At the cold spot
Take me back to the cold spot"
Country,Kane Brown,2016,Chapter 1,Excuses,"Always stayin' out late, get off at 8
But you come to door at 3
Name on your phone says caller unknown
But girl you ain't foolin' me
I can see it in your eyes and all the shh you hide

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

Say you're out with your friends, try to pretend
Like I don't know what you're doing
It's funny to me, the joke is on you
And girl I see through it

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid
Girl you ain't foolin' me
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses"
