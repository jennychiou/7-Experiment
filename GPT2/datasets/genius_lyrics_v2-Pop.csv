Pop,Justin Bieber,2015,Purpose,Love Yourself,"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself

Pop,Justin Bieber,2015,Purpose,Sorry,"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me

You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is"

Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame

I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no

I know you don't wanna talk, right

You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

J Smith and JB, uh huh

Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up

With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that, cause I still believe

I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see

Pop,Justin Bieber,2015,Purpose,Life Is Worth Living,"Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, ""Where you been?""
Love me like you don't want it to end

I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, you're less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be"

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn

Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be

Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

Pop,Justin Bieber,2013,Journals,Memphis,"I love you, need you
Need you here to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
""I love you, need you, need you here to stay""

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
""I love you, need you, need you here to stay""

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' ""Finally Famous!"" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?

Pop,Adele,2015,25 ,Hello,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore

Ooh, anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
Pop,Adele,2015,25 ,When We Were Young,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light

We were sad of getting old, it made us restless

(When we were young)

It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

Pop,Adele,2008,19,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue and
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love


The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"
Pop,Adele,2012,Skyfall (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Skyfall,"This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end

So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)

Pop,Adele,2015,25 ,Million Years Ago,"I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

Means we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only one I never looked for
There is something in your loving that tears down my walls

I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion

All of my life, I've been frozen

You're the right kind of madness
You're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope of everything, everywhere

Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
""I'll be home so soon, I won't be late""

He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own

However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you

Pop,Adele,2008,19,Daydreamer,"Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life"

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?

Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
'Cause, baby, I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through?

I can't decide if I should run and hide

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breathe
Whatever it is, I depend on it
And where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you

I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

You were a shot in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark, and it never will fade
You've ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Why do you love me, do you love me?

Pop,Adele,2008,19,First Love,"So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry
Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire

Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love"
Pop,Adele,2008,19,Crazy for You,"Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you"
Pop,Adele,2011,21,I Found a Boy,"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, ""Will you leave your man?""
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now, but I don't need you"
Pop,Adele,2008,19,Right as Rain,"Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, ""I chose to be alone""
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of (love)

Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
When we were both right, and no one had blame
But now, I give up on this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes, and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned

You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what

Never mind
Said your open arms
I couldn't help believe
The trick me back into them

Sana üzgün olduğumu söylemek için, yaptığım her şey adına
Ama ne zaman arasam evde olmuyorsun

En azından sana söylemeye çalıştığımı söyleyebilirim
Özür dilerim, kalbini kırdığım için
Ama fark etmez, belli ki bu artık seni üzmüyor
Merhaba, nasılsın?
Kendim hakkında konuşmam ne kadar da normal
Özür dilerim, umarım iyisindir

Hani hiçbir şey olmayan yer?
Bu gizli değil

I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga


Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"

I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah

Pop,Drake,2013,Nothing Was the Same,Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2,"Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog

Yellow diamonds in my Jesús

Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia

My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel


Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg"
Pop,Drake,2011,Take Care,Marvin’s Room,"Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say…

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
""Well, I'm sorry.""

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, ""You niggas crazy""
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We really gonna be in some trouble, trouble"

And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name

My heart belongs to you...

Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year

You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says ""I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place; not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misin-terpret
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)

Angels protect you

I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars

Of alcohol and weed addiction

Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure"
Pop,Drake,2011,Take Care,Look What You’ve Done,"It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you..."
Pop,Drake,2018,Scorpion,I’m Upset,"Yeah
I'm working on dying

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (That I know)

Pop,Drake,2013,Nothing Was the Same,The Motion,"It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Pop,Drake,2017,More Life,Teenage Fever,"Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ"
Pop,Drake,2017,More Life,Do Not Disturb,"Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"
Pop,Drake,2011,Take Care,Take Care,"I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll, I'll)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll, I'll)
I've loved and I've lost
Yeah

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll, I'll)
I've loved and I've lost"

Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing

Pop,Drake,2013,Care Package,5 AM in Toronto,"Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?

Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah"

The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star

Pop,The Weeknd,2011,House of Balloons,The Morning,"I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work"

Superstar lines back at the crib

All glass and it's four feet wide

If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience

So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh"

Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough

It's death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall

Pop,Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless (Japanese Edition),Love Story,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling

I had to take them away

There I was, giving you a second chance

Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you

Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?

And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

There was nothing else I could do

But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week

And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it

Pop,Taylor Swift,2017,reputation,Why She Disappeared [Poem],"When she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
""Whatever you say, it is not right.""
""Whatever you do, it is not enough.""
""Your kindness is fake.""
""Your pain is manipulative.""
When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.
When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.
When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
""May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice""
And even louder:
""without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here.""
And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive."
Pop,Taylor Swift,2012,Red,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed"

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight

Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences

Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Pop,Taylor Swift,2012,Red,State of Grace,"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never
(So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same

But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"
Pop,Taylor Swift,2017,reputation,Reputation [Prologue],"Here's something I've learned about people.
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.
This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.
The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.
When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?
Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.
There will be no further explanation.
There will be just reputation."
Pop,Taylor Swift,2012,Red,Red,"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

When you write a report on a book you never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed

Because everything is not what it seems

But you got a quick way to get from A to B
Just be careful of who's aware of your reality
You know what I mean!
There's a whole other world that you only know
When you can make yourself invisible from head to toe
But understand, it's not the status quo
Oh, careful what you show!

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams

When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were

That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on

I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed
And if there is too much on my plate then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice
You gave me what I needed and I gave her everything she wanted
There's something 'bout your cleavage, now I can't put my fingers on it
Been taking me the deepest, I thought that she was gonna vomit
If all women are from Venus then I guess I really got a rocket
You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart, I took some Gaviscon

As you sail from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach
My flesh will flee
So help my lifeless frame to breathe

And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see
As you steal my soul from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

Bite chunks out of me
You’re a shark and I’m swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe-to-toe, back-to-back, let’s go, my love; it’s very late
‘Til morning comes, let’s tessellate

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One’s empty, one’s not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they’ll nosh you up
Yes, they’ll nosh the love away but it’s fair to say
You will still haunt me

Lightning fast, felt the crash
Scared to lose, fear attacks
We only know goodbye

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive
You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better
Because you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive
You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Stumbling out in the dark
You left me with a question mark
You said the bridges had to be burned

And it's a pain that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise

There's a place we try to reach
Impossible as it would seem
I heard you crying out in your sleep
I see that look you save for me
I pull you back upon your feet
I know you always need something more, more

And it's a thing that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own

I look in the mirror
And I try to see myself
My head full of terror
From the games I played so well
I try to see clearer
I try to forget the fires I started
I try to be nearer
To where you are
To where you are

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where do these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
I look in the mirror
'Cause I was the girl who was on fire

I look in the mirror
And I try to understand
And piece it together
Wash the blood from both my hands
I can't see the ending
There are people who know my every secret
I'm tired of pretending
You're in my heart
You're in my heart

Are we star crossed lovers?

Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say?

Drink the sky, meditate
Open eyes, sun roof
Give me miles, give me truth

Sometimes I get low

In a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger
I'm a lone ranger

I'm a lion, I'm a tiger
I'm a caged bird, I'm on fire
Got these paper wings but they hold the air
Get too close to somebody but don't stay there
Much less brave then I admit
Much more scared then they all think
But I'm protecting this organ in my chest
'Cause the blood, sweat and tears
They can make quite a mess

Open eyes, open roof
Give me miles, give me truth

Sometimes I get high
Sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be
In a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger
I'm a lone ranger

I don't want to get broken, baby
I don't want to get broken, baby
I don't want to get broken, baby
Cut open babe, cut open, baby
I don't want to get broken, baby
I don't want to get broken, baby
I don't want to get broken, baby
Cut open babe, cut open, baby

Sometimes I get high
Sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be
In a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger

Pop,Rachel Platten,2017,Waves,Grace,"Is this what I've become?
Someone who gets jealous of someone?
Instead of open arms and honest praise
I'm closing doors and pushing love away
When did I come undone?
When did the colors of my canvas start to run?
I can't control the teardrops on my face
I know this ain't the girl my mother raised

I used to wear love like an army
I used to know nothing could harm me
Now fear got up all in my head, I'm all in my head
And I made a mess, I confess, I'm ashamed

And I need grace
To step inside my mind and help me be a better person
Or at least a better version of me
'Cause right now, all I wanna do is scream
That I need grace
'Cause I'm running low on faith
And I really wanna change my heart
'Cause I'm falling apart these days
And what I really need is grace, grace, grace

I feel like I'm a ghost
I forgot the most important thing I know
That there's nobody else I have to be
There's no one else I have to please
I have the answers that I need

I used to wear love like an army
I used to know nothing could harm me
Now fear got up all in my head, I'm all in my head
And I made a mess, I confess, I'm ashamed

Inhaling and orbiting
Our great planet will fit on the tip of your thumb
You'll say I finally see how time stops
And everything that hurts us drops off

I'll be what you want
When everything is gone
Let the world disappear
There are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find

And no one’s safe from being called out or evaluated
And people change on a whim
So cue the violence
Let's go rescue a planet that's been thrown away (yeah)
You'll name it after me
'Cause after all we're only one triumphant bang away
From resting in infinity or darkness or some brighter place
Let's not waste one more second on caring about
Trying to figure out what looks right
'Cause that can't take away that you're mine

When everything is gone
Let the world disappear
There are places up here we can hide

Pop,Rachel Platten,2019,Wonder Park (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Wonder,"Be the change you wanna see
Build the world that you need
 stuck in stone
Make a world to call your own

So break the rules just because you do
You defy the odds, bring the stars into you

You are the wonder, the light and the thunder
You're the ultimate star
You can't be hurried, broken or worried
No, you see in the dark, you see in the dark
There is wonder in your heart

Who said it can't be done?
You can't shine brighter than the sun
Gravity all around
What goes up must come down

But you break the mould, chase the , just do
You defy the odds, bring the stars into you

You are the wonder, the light and the thunder
You're the ultimate star
You can't be hurried, broken or worried
No, you see in the dark, you see in the dark
There is wonder in your heart

There is wonder in your heart"

I've memorized the cracks that age the road
I couldn't quite grasp what my heart meant
But I think that it was telling me to go

Now I'm going up, down, spinning round
Trying to communicate
But these words aren't quite what I'm trying to say
I'm coming close, close, close
I feel it in my toes, toes, toes

There's a light that shines when I'm on the road
There's a brand new sky that I need to go
I'm reading signs, signs, signs
And I'm, I'm, I'm seeing patterns in the snow
As the road leads me into the great unknown

Seventeen blocks from the station
And forty-eight stops from the coast
I could jump with all my clothes on in the ocean
And let the water rock me in her throws

And go up, down, spin round
Leave it up to fate
Like some sailor finding comfort in the waves
I'm coming close, close, close
I feel it in my toes, toes, toes

There's a light that shines when I'm on the road
There's a brand new sky where I need to go
I'm reading signs, signs, signs
And I'm, I'm, I'm seeing patterns in the snow
As I walk into the great unknown

I feel it in my toes, I know I'm coming close
So I'll leave this old town with her saints and her ghosts
I'm coming close, close, close
The signs say I need to go, go, go

There's a light that shines when I'm on the road
There's a brand new sky where I need to go
I'm reading signs, signs, signs
And I'm, I'm, I'm seeing patterns in the snow
As I walk into the great unknown

Searching each other for the missing parts

Doesn't anybody find somebody in this story
Strangers passing on the subway
I'd give anything to know your name

We are spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Is this all we, all we are?
All we are is spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Does it ever break your heart?
And I wanna know your name, wanna feel your charm
Wanna feel your pain
And I wanna know your name, wanna feel your joy
Wanna feel your pain

Soldiers passing on the sidewalk
Hiding heartache under too much makeup
I remember when we were so brave
And got back all that love we gave away

It doesn't have to be so lonely here for everybody
Doesn't anybody wanna feel a part of something
Soldiers passing on the sidewalk
Can we remember all that we forgot

We are spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Is this all we, all we are?
All we are is spirits dancing on a lonely planet

We are everything we own, right?
And the second that we don't fight
Is the moment that we own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop

We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here
Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips
The only real moment is this
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh, love what we got because love is a lot
Life fools us into thinking that we're broke but we're not
Bring your body in to the beach again
Recognize the moment that you're free again

You are everything you own
And the second that you don't fight
Is the moment that you own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is

The only real moment is this
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

So they lead you to the beach again
Heat is getting to your head you think
Someone pulls you in and the lights are dim
But you recognize the rhythm crawling through your skin and

We are everything we own, right?

But oh you like that, yes you like that

We need some beautiful remarks
Yes, we do

We hang up photographs of people that we love

Seal my voice

How long I have
Waited here for you

Now I'm broken, hoping
You'll glue me up again

And all I seem to do
Hold my breath
Waiting here for you
And all I seem to want
Is the warmth
Of your hands on me
I can't bear to think
Of you leaving me again
And all I seem to want
Is the warmth of your skin

I wait to hear
Your car switch gears
Last night's glasses
Steam like cheap red wine
Your warm face
A thought misplaced
I sink into assorted grace
I pull up my shades
And finally sleep

Now I'm broken, hoping
That you'll glue me up again

While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together, you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake

And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

And the way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
And the way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie

Whoa, girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore

I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth

Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though, you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

You know me and honestly I'm better without ya

My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know, that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely and you didn't want me
Trying to show me, that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no Goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

The month was June
The smoky sun, our fatal run
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

Leave me fucking lonely

Bitch, can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fucking lonely, yeah

Lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely"

Your selfish hands always expecting more
Am I your child, or just a charity ward?

You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless

Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter

It's been five years since we've spoken last
And you can't take back what we never had
Oh, I can be manipulated only so many times
Before even ""I love you"" starts to sound like a lie

You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless

Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter

Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you push me out of your world?
Lied to your flesh and your blood
Put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved
Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you throw me right out of your world?
So young when the pain had begun
Now forever afraid of being loved

Oh, father

Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative

I know you're able, willin’ and able

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight

Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy

So you know just what I like
You know my mind
Even seen boys come and go

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Pop,Ed Sheeran,2017,÷ (Divide),Nancy Mulligan,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border

Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again

And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now

And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon

See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists

See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me

I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia

I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day

Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift

And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

Thought I'd find her in a bottle

Pop,Ed Sheeran,2011,+ (Plus),U.N.I.,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another ""like you""
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh)
And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I

And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"

I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?

I'm sat here, wishing I was sober

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it

Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again

Pop,Alessia Cara,2018,The Pains Of Growing,Growing Pains,"You're on your own, kid
You are

Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, ""Now, don't you overreact""
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Try to mend what's left of my content incomprehension
As I take on the stress of the mess that I've made
Don’t know if I even care for ""grown"" if it's just alone, yeah

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind

And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No band-aids for the growing pains (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

No, no, no band-aids for the growing pains"

And I'm planning my escape
Cause I know I can't stay
In my veins I got the feeling
Like there must be something more
I've never been so sure

All night and day
I dream of a place

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

These streets aren't easy
And I need your hand to hold
So I'm not alone
And I hear all these voices
Though they try to slow me down
I can tune them out

All night and day
I dream of a place

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
So I'm packing my bags
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

Here it goes
I clear my throat
And cue the violins
Making moves
Shout it from the rooftops
I'm trying to live, yeah

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine

Lay in my arms, why won't you?

What you waiting on?
'Cause I've been laying here
Learning what the memories won't do
See, I need you, and baby, I need to
Let down my guard and give you my scars
Open up my heart

We could be stars
We could be stars
We could be stars

Rap on my window, come home
It's been a while, so stick around
Why don't you?
'Til the end of time
Say that you'll be mine

Really wants to do
See, I need you
And sometimes we need to
Shed our facade and be just who we are
All broken and torn, then we could be stars

Oh, we could be stars
We could be stars
We could be stars

Piercing lights in the dark
Make the galaxy ours
Kingdom right where we are
Shining bright as a morning
You'll never be lonely
Just promise you'll love me
I'm never too far
And we'll never part
And we could be stars

Oh, we could be stars
We could be stars
Oh, we could be stars

Just find a way to get home
There's space in my heart
Open arms for you to run to
Baby, close your eyes and take the leap
To make believe in fairytales
I'll meet you there
Oh yeah, I'll fall too
See, I've wanted you here
All along but my fear
Just keeps haunting me, won't let me go

Pop,Alessia Cara,2015,Know-It-All,My Song,"Tune in to find my peace and solitude
These empty rooms spin, and I embrace the flaws of being human
The black and white... and sometimes the greys that stay for days
The in between times
The meantimes that make this song of life sing
Play, rest, repeat, read exactly what is written on the sheet
""Don't deviate,"" they say
But I will play what's best for me
I'll press the keys and pull the strings
Create a symphony that's mine

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

Let go
I let my voice be heard, then listen for the echo
My own reverb is playing
Cause I'm a movement
There's dissonance, sometimes I make mistakes
Oh I'm human after all, I'm not your expectations
But play, rest, repeat, that's what they ask of me
Just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
But I'll play what's best for me
I'll ring the bells and crash the cymbals
My harmonious design

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

In my time here, I wanna be revered and remembered
Oh let them say I came, I conquered
So I won't fear and I can't blend in
You can't replace me and you cannot erase me
Cause my song will live on beyond time

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song

Do you think he's looking down, curled up on his couch right now?
As we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound?
Is he proud? Are we proud?
Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter
Making boring people famous
Let's pretend they're fascinating
Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better
Or that pigment or religion really matters

We're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created could make for some good TV

Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made
Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days

Does he hang his head at all the greed that we possess?
As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess
Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the loose ends
Stressed like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us
God, or is it Mr. G to me?
I hope that through the static, you’ll show us the clarity
'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet
Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep
Do you sleep in peace?

'Cause we're in some trouble

The mayhem is rolling, but it ain't showbiz
Reality's potent, chaotic, I know it
But we're growing, have some hope in us
And were we worth all the time you gave up?

No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?"
Pop,Sam Smith,2015,NOW That’s What I Call Music! 92 [UK],Writing’s on the Wall,"I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all

She said, ""You're dancing in the movies""
I almost started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you

I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, mmm
It's fire on fire

When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won't abide by any rules

I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home

No, I’ll never be no one in my whole life

You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone

See a bird soaring high above the flood

Sitting with the poison takes away the pain

Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon

How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up

Angels in the marble waiting to be freed

The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)

Never would have made it, babe?

Could have given love, now I’m taking love

Hello!
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe ?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Take all of me

The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me

And my torturer became my remedy

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby

Every promise don't work out that way"
Pop,Beyoncé,2016,Lemonade,Love Drought,"Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now

Pop,Beyoncé,2013,BEYONCÉ,Pretty Hurts,"Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

Mama said, ""You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters""

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)"

From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is

That feels different from when I hear yours

And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)

Loving you was easy, once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
And I tried, and I tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I'll always remember feeling like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another, more than my own life
But that part of me I gave you, it was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinking, ""What's up with B?""
I been crying for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie?"

I go back to her and you go back too

You gotta trust me, Ma

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me

You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?

Pop,Nicki Minaj,2014,The Pinkprint,The Crying Game,"Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone, 'cause the tears don't end

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'ma ask on the song

So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
You

Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Two seats in my two seater-er-er
Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You

You

I know you just wanna be heard
I'm a bad bitch, you ain't used to that
You gon' fuck around and make me do you bad
Used to creep, creep, with you through the back
I count up the cash and bring you the bag
I count up the racks like Serena
Plus I got that ass like Selena
And you know nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, not a bitch
That's gon' care, care, hold you down and love you like this
Drop down, turn around, baby show you like this
Won't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you

Baby, now I'm through with you

'Cause you don't even know what you just lost
You don't even know what you just had
You don't even know, and that's what's bad
Money bag long, that bitch bad
Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white
Now you spendin' cold nights
You've been in the wrong so long
You don't even know right
Call my line, call my line, I'm like, ""Please, boy""
You just need to leave, boy
I ain't got time for you
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy

Even though I said I didn’t need you, I lied, I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said don’t touch me, I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said ""Let’s see""
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cutting them brake lines

I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? who knows? So, I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said ""Fuck you"", I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool, I, I'm not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you
So I lied, I lied, I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

I lied, ooh baby
Ooo-ooh
'Cause what if I just let myself go with you?
It’s all good now, goodbye love
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart forever"

These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

Yo, yo, cause I came out
'09, when promoters brought Wayne out
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out
I been bad, like cuttin' school and stayin' out
I been hotter than, vacationin' and layin' out
I sat back and watched how it was playin' out
They diss me, but runnin' and took the same route
Uhn, but no, they not Nicki
Wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky

Go against me, then you made a mistake

So good, so real, so good, yeah
I'ma win again

Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood

Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'

I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise

Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanye's

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly

And everything on you intoxicates

I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste

Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault

It feel good, right?
Listen

I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song to me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song to me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
(I won't let you down, baby)

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl

Ma, whatchu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask ""How the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""Wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a-like
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your... brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)

Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (hey!)

Find out that they have made the final mistake

She told me that she found her perfect bloodmate

Aw, give it to me now

It circulate you start to feel it

Once she starts to evoke the spirit
(Got you on the floor)
Ooh she comes alive when you look killing

Hey, Ithink she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you

It makes me say...
It makes me say...

Her pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad
I don't wanna think
'Cause the others wanna burn with me
But they don't hold a candle
It feels like

When a mother's love is bringin' you home
When you needed, needed, needed a stone
Someone to lean on
Now I know I could never sit in his chair
And that missin' love left you bare, yeah

And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man
And in her face, she knew I wasn't staying

Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make forty-some dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped outta school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See I can't put down the pipe

And it's breaking me down, watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I woulda done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is I'll probably never know
The color of my daughter's eyes

And it is breaking me down, watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
So can you help me find my way?

Oh my God, please forgive me (Father, hear me pray)
Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life
If I could do it all again, have just one more chance
To take all those wrongs and make them right

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?

I'll be a mountain main 'til the day I die

Is the hardest thing for you

Do you like it like this? Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Tell me which way you like that

You can't stop, baby
You can't stop once you've turned me on
And your enemy are your thoughts, baby
So just let 'em go
'Cause all I need is a moment alone
To give you my tongue and put you out of control
And after you let it in, we'll be skin to skin
It's just so natural

Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon

We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we've both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

No fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down

Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
(For real)

Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that

I'll take more love than I'm allowed

I won't hide or cut it off from where it came

This power and the color of my face

I can't help it she's so fine

Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye

We want it again, and we want it again

So we fake it again
I think we're gonna blow it, and we know it
But she's naked again
We get wasted, then I taste it, then I waste it again
I can't invite her again
Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
And I'll fight her again
So it's over, but I told her to come over

Again I'm wasting time
But she's always on my mind
I can't let her go
Oh, she's not the best, but she's all that I know

Can't quite see eye to eye

I'm your national anthem, God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"", he said, ""Yes, yes, yes…""

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?

I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age, for the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up, give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes

Into the blue (Into the blue)

Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)

Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

We were two kids just tryin' to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
But when we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you

Pop,Lana Del Rey,2015,Honeymoon,The Blackest Day,"Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god

Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god

You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again"

Pop,Lana Del Rey,2012,Born to Die,This is What Makes Us Girls,"Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
While she starts to cry
Mascara running down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

And that's where the beginning of the end began
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancing at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night

Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""
(C'mon, take a shot)

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair, and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying 'cause I know I'm never coming back

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen, oh"

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero
Even though you’ve lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

Now there’s gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you’ll always win
Even when I’m right
‘Cause you feed me fables from your head
The violent words and empty threats
And it’s sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I’m a masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
'Till the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who’s counting?
I may have hit you three times, I’m starting to lose count
But together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I’m in my fucking mind, without you, I’m out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing makes me wanna cry

Coulda been somebody's son

Whatchu expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, aye-uh

Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself

Sometimes it helps""

That he’s here, means he’s never lost

That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades
Blacked-out Maybach

As in, going 'til they say stop
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here

Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now
Run through your town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah

Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Mane""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be

Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?

It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons

It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
""'Cause I'm a wandering man,"" he said to me
""And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?""
So, I said...

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be

And then he asked me, he said
""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.""

Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me

For life (see the world with me)

I feel like the money can never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I am influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving her money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'mma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business, but I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs

Oh

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

Love

We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir tout seule

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme

I love you, when it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad, I'll turn away
I'll turn away
I'll turn away

And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyish thoughts

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I love you
And after all it's just another day

Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

We both know
I could learn a thing or two
About behavin'
But I love you
And after all it's just another day
Come on, Mark!

Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Saw you downtown, singing the blues

Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right

There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

The first time, every time when you're touching me
I make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun, we are one buzzing energy
Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science (science), we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower, with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no

Pop,Miley Cyrus,2017,Younger Now,Malibu,"I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu"

They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round here waiting for a man to tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on my speed dial?)

Pop,Miley Cyrus,2015,Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz,BB Talk,"Alright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess

You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it, too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo

You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
I don't really wanna get over you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Baby talk is creeping me out

You finger my heart
And I know just what I need
What I came here to do
What I've been thinking, babe, been most about you

I want you to bang my box

You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face
Want you to eat it, babe"
Pop,Miley Cyrus,2009,Hannah Montana: The Movie,Butterfly Fly Away,"You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could been
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may, and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away

Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
You've been waiting for this day
All along you've known just what to do

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away

And I, I would die for you

Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't know how to choose just so wisely
But I see trees and their colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be

When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?

That you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy and better than any childhood dreams
I am yours and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need a ring
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything

When you're gone, time moves so slow

When you know I'm not one to keep dealin' with the shit
That you put me through

I know that I gave you my heart

You used to make me smile, but now you don't do that anymore
It feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone
But when I think of you gone
I know

I know that I gave you my heart

I should've called you sooner, you loved me for so long
And it's been a while since I've been with someone else
'Cause I got too good at just doing it myself

So much depth, you look for the light

You’ll cry out now and you’ll question why

I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out

I am here and I see your pain
Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain

Pop,Sia,2016,The Hamilton Mixtape,Satisfied,"A toast to the groom!
(To the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
To the bride!
(To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
From your sister
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side, by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide, you provide)
May you always (always)
Be satisfied (Rewind)
Rewind!
Rewind!
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I remember that—

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place
But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,”
I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
This is not a game…

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, you forget yourself
You’re like me, I’ve never been satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied
My name's Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Where’s your fam’ly from?
Unimportant, there’s a million things I haven’t done
Just you wait, just you wait...

So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance
He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give him a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is

Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
Cause I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister
And that elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
(I will never be satisfied)
(I will never be satisfied)

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”
But she’d be lying
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn’t sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

To the groom!
(To the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
To the bride!
(To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
From your sister
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side, by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide, you provide)
May you always
Be satisfied
And I know (yeah)
She’ll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied"

Tied by a juicehead who just took his t shot, and I know
There's a hungry dog tugging at your frayed ends
But he's just playing with you, he just wants to be your friend

So don't worry, don't worry I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)

Eyes stingin' from the black smoke, new hope
Loose rope, risen from the undertow
All is well
We welcome the cry of the dark night sky
Swallow me peacefully, follow my heart back inside

Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game

You terrify me, we've still not kissed and yet I've cried
You got too close and I pushed and pushed hoping you'd bite
So I could run, run and that I did but through the dust
You saw those teeth marks, they weren't all yours
You had been thrust into a history
That had not worked for me
Into a history, from which I could not flee
So go on, shake me, shake until I give it up
Wearin' me down, baby, I know that we could make some love

Hoping you might take it off
Don't know your etiquette but
I'm strapped to my chair, and it ain't 'cause you're pretty
You were charming, until
You saw your chance to kill, your chance to make history

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess
Boy, you and your promises
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss
Now you'll just have memories

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

Boy, you draw me back in
I'm hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word

Pop,Calvin Harris,2012,18 Months,Sweet Nothing,"You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing"

I need your love

I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

All the years, all the times
You were never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time

A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin'
I got more liquor, more ladies, more drugs and no cases
With jobs and no babies
I hope no phone’s taping and if so you gon' hate me

When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couple's counselin'
Open that shit wide

Goin' hard till I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are on me
Wishin' they could X and O me
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off
On the ledge and we danglin' off
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off

Body language speaks louder than verbal

Pop,Calvin Harris,2009,Ready for the Weekend,Ready for the Weekend,"Counterfeit, counterfeit, that's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this end amicably
Lick the blood stain from your finger, say, ""What do you see?""
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be
(You want it to be)

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend

Coming back, coming back to a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view
(You fall out of view)

You get a feeling, that's what you choose

My first mistake was letting you into my life
Yes, it was
My second mistake was allowing you into my bed
Laying in my bed
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Though I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you, it crossed my mind that a heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
('Cause it's the worst day of my life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life

And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

See, yesterday, I called her back
The day before, I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still, it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago, I did my thing
Three o' clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow, I thought we could chill
There won't be us, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see, Cupid, he will stab you in the back like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking me cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said, ""Take two of these
And call me in the morning""
It's the worst day

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
See the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

Woo, woo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana) woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! (Yeah, make that change)
Make that change, Shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change!"

Pop,Michael Jackson,1995,"HIStory: Past, Present And Future - Book 1",You Are Not Alone,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart

Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's
Got a role for me
I'm so confused
Will you show it to me
That you'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me

Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow

I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, then got out, and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down, toward the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I saw a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear
She says this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down in my eyes, and started crying, and grabbed my hand, you've got a friend

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

Take me to a place without no name

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done, it really looked like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl

In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me

To set you on your feet again

Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

He was born a pauper to a pawn
On a Christmas day

Like a gentle cobweb hanging

Would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead

To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns
Oh, great father of the Iroquois

I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?
I take only what is mine, Lord
My pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run
Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead
Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole"

And Michael Heseltine!

So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher

We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...

Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

And they've brought their fascist bootboys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...

But in the moonlight, you just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With a smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty, I'm speechless, and I don't know where to start

And I can't explain

Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe

Pop,Elton John,1975,Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy,We All Fall in Love Sometimes,"Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
It's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we?
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
""Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?""


And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh
We all fall in love sometimes"
Pop,Elton John,1992,The One,The Last Song,"Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son

Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free

Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son"
Pop,Elton John,1973,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,This Song Has No Title,"Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune"
Pop,Whitney Houston,1992,The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album,I Have Nothing,"Share my life, take me for what I am
Because I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm

Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

Pop,Whitney Houston,1986,Whitney Houston,Greatest Love of All,"I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe

Inside of me

That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"

I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands


You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine


I will be
I will be free
I will be
I will be free"

I just do

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional, baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk
I just watch your mouth

I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional, baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
I get so emotional, baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands

I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once"
Pop,Whitney Houston,1991,Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances,The Star Spangled Banner,"Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Over the land of the free and the home of the brave"

When there's nobody else to turn to
Who do I talk to?
When nobody wants to listen
Who do I lean on? Oh
When there is no foundation stable
I go to the rock
I know he is able, I go to the rock

I go to the rock of my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain
And the mountain he stands by me
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter I go to the rock

Where do I go, where do I go
When the storms of life are threatening
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation
Go to the rock, I know he is able
I go to the rock

I go the rock when I need a friend
I can go to the rock
I go to the rock when I need a shelter
You can go to the rock
I can go
I go to the rock
I can go to the rock
I can go, I can go to the rock
I can go when I need some shelter
When I need a friend
I can go

And when the Earth around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand I can stand
When I need a friend
I go to the rock
I can go to the rock

There must be higher love
Down in the heart or
Hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart
I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We will walk the line
And try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love
I keep thinking of

Worlds are turning
And we're just hanging on
Facing our fear
And standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone
Who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We will walk the line
And try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love
I keep thinking of

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
I could light the night up
With my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine
From pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love

Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain

Uh huh
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?
I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me

I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life

Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe

Don't say no more la la la la la la la la la
Uncover you're ears girl
I'm not listening la la la la la la la la la
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me



It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changing now he'll prove you wrong
No you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure, for sure"

Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the war
Paid the hell you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name
(Forget your name) Mmm

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy (Crazy)

Perrear con sus amigas, es lo que le gusta

Es que es la más dura
Sólo utiliza Chanel
Qué bien lo combina con su joya Cartier

And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh-so many times
Those tear drops, they won't fall again
I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said...

Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard
I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on

After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart
But you can't break me down
Not falling apart
Once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top

'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Me and my guitar, tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna leave with more than what I got
'Cause 68 cent just ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops

'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Here come Junior Gong
I'm flying high like Superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I dunno if it's just because
Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I would stand up to de cops
And stand up to de bigga heads
Becaw de whole ah de ah saps
All de talk dem a talk
And dem fly make nah drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape de trap

Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow

Or leaving me feeling used
Would you go and break my heart?

She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skee-os away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker, when we apart it makes her
Want a piece of paper, scribble down ""I hate ya""
But she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does and ugh!

Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down

You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through?
Do you cling to your pride and sing ""I Will Survive""?
Do you lash out and say: ""How dare you leave this way""?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away?

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
(Losing my mind, losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (how dare you leave?)
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
I'm gonna breakdown

Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
(It'll break ya down, only if you let it
Every day crazy situation's rockin' my mind
Tryin' to break me down, but I won't let it, forget it)
I been feeling like your breaking me down
Kicking me around, stressing me out
I think you better go and get out
And let me release some stress, stress
(Don't ever wanna feel no pain, pain
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain, rain, rain, rain
Lord, I just wanna maintain)
Yeah, I'm feeling pressures you all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
(Slowing dying inside in my heart, just cry)
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (How do I feel?)
And I lie convincingly
(I'm losing my mind!)
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering

Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies

Ready to land

Aren't overflowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me

For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be"
Pop,Mariah Carey,1997,Butterfly,The Roof,"(I got you stuck off the realness)
(I got you stuck off the realness)

It wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely a little misty on
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding (pounding)
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet
And started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
(You took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time (And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night, I dreamed that I
Whispered the words ""I love you, boy""
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Pretty baby, how I'm missing you)

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night"

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Where do I go from here?
How do I disappear?
Here beyond the looking glass
Somewhere off the beaten path
Heartache never seems to pass, just lasts
And I'd go

Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay real close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life
La da da da da
La da da da da

Somewhat desensitized
Still the same hopeful child
Haunted by those severed ties
Pushing past the parasites
Down but not demoralized
Unconfined, but don't let go

Yes I know that tomorrow comes
So I'll be here when you rise (Rise)
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life

And for the finale, she can float around effortlessly
And dream away the hours in her mind
And I let go

Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide

How'd our fairytale just end up this way?

We went round for round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again

When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Okay, so it's five AM and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine, but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels, but it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number, got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called
To say you're trying to reach me
Probably because you see that I'm with someone new (what?)

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby, over you and me
(Baby, don't cry)

Sipping Bailey's Cream, by the stereo (Yeah, yeah)
Trying to find relief on the radio (Ah, what's up?)
I'm suppressing the tears
But they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear is the song I wrote
When we first got together early that September
I can't bear to listen, so I might as well drift
In the kitchen pour another glass or two
And try to forget you (Ya know, ya know)

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes (baby, don't cry) so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me
(Baby, don't cry)

Baby, hear me when I say
""Let that man be on his way""
Don't even waste your time
And worry 'bout how he handle things
Baby, hear me when I say
""A playa feeling good today""
You know you're too fly to even waste your time
Watch how I handle things
Man, you's a fool for this
But on the real dog, I'm cool with this
We doing this
D-O double G Z-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry

Late at night like a little child (Dry your eyes)
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know

I'm up awake
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
It could have been so perfect

Oh, I gotta get me some sleep

Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make or break up, can't take this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is, baby, I try and try so hard to keep our love alive

If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it (Hey, hey)

Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do

My friends tell me I ain't the same no more
We still need each other when we stumble and fall
How we gonna act like what we had ain't nothing at all now?

Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down, like we used to
Hit the block, proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes?
I can't last one moment alone
Now go, I know

We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do

Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

See you soon if you got the heart
Meet you outside Rennie Park
Hurry up if it's gettin' dark

Hopped into that old Benz
Drive through where that road ends
Good times with some old friends
I got just the thing if you so tense
Burn one, let's go do some

Zoned out with a blank stare
I'm lookin' into the future

When that 40 end
When that dream team all played out and they hit the bench
I just step back, lemme soak it in
I've seen the ups and downs so I get it now, I was born to win
It's my time, 'bout time, my turn, I can't lie
Waiting for that one spark
My one hope to catch fire
I'm fine, I'm high
Light rain through that sunshine
Tryin' to man this old boat
I'm the captain now and it's crunch time
I don't care if I'm gettin' paid
Need the week but I get the day
Wide awake when I need sleep
I'm knee deep but I set the way
Focused on that one mistake, let it free don't let it break
Fuck it all, I'm turning in
My celly's off, the great escape

You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happening)
Now you've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts

Sue you, take your dog, take your house

Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime, but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word, we make it sting for him

Eye for eye, you piece of sh—
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal
But just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady friends—whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated and I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up, 'cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count, get it? (I hate you)
And then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me, then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
(Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, SLUT!)
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me, while I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember, you cheated on me first (bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war
Fellas, ladies

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (oh-ohh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh-ohh)

Pop,P!nk,2012,The Truth About Love,Try,"Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Eh, eh, eh

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try

Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss “Knowing it's all good”
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean
When you talk
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?

And you wouldn't flinch or even feel a thing
And you've retreated to your silent corner
Like you decided the fight was over for ya

But everyone you know, is trying to smooth it over
Find a way to make the hurt go away
But everyone you know, is trying to smooth it over
Everyone needs a floor they can fall through

But, I won't let you make the great escape
I'm never gonna watch you checking out of this place
I'm not gonna lose you
Cause the passion and the pain
Are gonna keep you alive someday
They're gonna keep you alive someday

Oh, terrified of the dark, but not if you go with me
And I won't need a pill to make me numb
And I wrote the book on running
But that chapter of my life will soon be done, oh

I'm the king of the great escape
You're not gonna watch me checking out of this place
You're not gonna lose me
Cause the passion and pain
Are gonna keep us alive, someday
Yeah the passion and the pain
Are gonna keep us alive someday, someday"

Am I heaven? Am I hell?
I can barely find the proof to save myself
Are you water? Are you fire?
Are you filthy? Are you pure?

But I'm not sure

Well, you're no angel

If you walk away I will suffer tonight

I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you, I am bound to you

So much, so young, I faced on my own
Walls I built up, became my home
I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us
Sweet love, so pure
I catch my breath with just one beating heart
And I brace myself, please, don't tear this apart

I found a man I can trust

I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you, I am bound to you

Suddenly the moments here
I embrace my fears
All that I have been carrying all these years
Do I risk it all?
Come this far just to fall, fall

I can trust

And how am I supposed to face this lonely life I've created?
Is that the price that I'm payin'?
I wanna feel it

All my life, wouldn't give up
Was too young to know the difference
How did I get so low?
When did I turn so cold
Inside of my own mind, I believe my own lies
I'm facing the mirror

Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just need to see ya, Maria

Now do you hear it in my voice?
That I'm tryna make a choice
I don't know which way to go at this crossroads
You duck taped my mouth shut
Make me feel worthless, used up

So tired of painting all this makeup
'Cause it won't hide my deep cuts
Eyes open, but can't see
Mouth open, but can't speak
I'm facing the mirror

Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?

Pop,Christina Aguilera,2003,Stripped,Can’t Hold Us Down,"Hmmm

So, what am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)
Never can, never will

So, what am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)

(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)

Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera gotcha back

You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls

This is for my girls all around the world, oh
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth

When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now
In a world where I have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world what's inside my heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else
For all time?

Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be free, to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why

Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?

Ooh, ah
Hey

He comes from a foreign place, an island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Till I'm breathless, I'm helpless, can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance to the rhythm of the band
I feel his fingertips grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss

Mama used to warn me to beware those Latin lovers
She said, ""I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother""
I said ""Ay mama, you seem to forget I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over""
But I realize big brown eyes can hypnotize when he says

""I am full blood boricua""
Reads the tattoo on his arm (Oh)
He tells me, ""Mami, I need ya""
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (Oh)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers, ""Te quiero, te quiero""
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation

Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within' (Melt within')
Feels so good, it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started, I'm givin' in (Givin' in)
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me (Inside of me)
Finds the words when I cannot speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me

Mama used to warn me not to rush love with another
She said, ""I'm not trying to lecture, I just care about my daughter""
""Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let a man control my emotions""
But when he smiles (When he smiles)
I feel like a little child when he says

""I am full blood boricua""

He tells me, ""Mami, I need ya""
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (So strong)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers, ""Te quiero, te quiero""
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation

Caught between my mama's words and what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world, but part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it? Can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico?
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight

He loves every freckle, every curve
Every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely
Taking all of me in
He's real, he's honest
He's loving me 4 me

Where your horses run free

I wondered if I had enough class

Pop,Prince,1987,Sign O’ the Times,Adore,"Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you
I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you
I was rappin' 'till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?

That's why
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride--
Well maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
All up in the place
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, can compare
To your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening?
I'm just tryin' to say

That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
You own my heart, you own my mind

I truly adore you, darlin'
Adore you

Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you

Can I talk to you?
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
That I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be like no other
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me
Without you there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is too weak to define how much I adore
You child, you child
The last words you hear
""Be with me darlin' til the end of all time
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body
I'll give you my time

Can't you just trust me?

Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there

I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long

""What hotel number is she in?""
Boys and motherfucking girls
""319, 319""
""Cool""
This is your captain with no name speaking
And I'm here to rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman you already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control
Are you ready?

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are trifling?
They just don't know
She said ""Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, you need Pussy Control'""
Are you ready?

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick want to stick her
Uh, talking more shit than a bit
'Bout how he going to make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said ""Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
You can go platinum four times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody want to hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't want to know
Boy, you better act like you understand
When you roll with Pussy Control""
Are you ready?

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

With one more verse to the story
I need another piece of your ear
I want to hip you all to the reason
I'm known as the player of the year
'Cause I met this girl named Pussy
At the Club International Balls
She was rolling four-deep
Three sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl driving her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you're here
I fear you're lonely and you want to know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I want to be
But it's going to be hard as hell
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want to sell, sell, sell
75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!
Can I tell you what I'm thinking that you already know?
You need a motherfucker that respects your name""
Now say it, Pussy Control
Are you ready?

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make'em act like they know
You are, was, and always will be Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Peace and be wild
Aaah, Pussy Control
Say what, huh?
Oh
Oh no, don't you think about calling her a ho

I can see whomever I choose

No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said, ""Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do""
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing


All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away

I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

I heard a voice on the news saying
People want to stop the war
If they had a love as sweet as you
They'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free, somebody lied
They can bug my phone and peep around my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside

I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

I've never seen the moon look so lovely
As the night I saw it with you
Let me know I'd never seen the moon before
So many speak of the moon
As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false
That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law round here
Because your beauty it gives one pause
It slows me down

I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

I love it when you call my name
Call, call my name
Call it, call my name"
Pop,Prince,1987,Sign O’ the Times,The Ballad of Dorothy Parker,"Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room
Fightin' with lover's past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered - ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't too hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said - ""It sound like a real man to me (you're kinda cute)
You're kinda cute, you wanna take a bath?"" (Do you wanna, do you wanna?) ... Bath?
Oh, I said - ""Cool, but I'm leavin' my pants on (What you say?)
Cuz I'm kinda goin' with someone""
She said - ""Sound like a real man to me
Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song,"" she said
And it was Joni singing, ""Help me, I think I'm falling""
(Drring) The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then and there I knew I was through (Dorothy Parker was cool)
Well
My pants were wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie cuz she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha, ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back to the violent room
(Tell us what you did, what you did) Let me tell you what I did
I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker
(Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker)
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Oh"

My main concern is you and me
Your honor, may I call to the stand my one and only witness?

Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want you to pump your hips like you used to

That I loved you with all my heart
But you were untrue
You had another lover and she looked just like you

Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

It's so hard to believe
Maybe it's because you're so young
Or maybe I'm just too naive
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun

Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

All your lovers - they look just like you
But they can only do the things that you do
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand
I'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man

Ain't nobody stoppin' cause we got this party poppin' now

Second things first, we know you got thirst

Tourists, 89 flowers on their back

They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are you listening?
We need a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight, and breed
No child is bad from the beginning
They only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol, and US history
What's to be expected is 3 minus 3
Absolutely nothing

Pop,Stevie Wonder,1976,Songs In the Key of Life,As,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know that you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream-Um (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4

Until the day that you are me and I am you

Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love?

That's so very lovely made from love"

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I

Pop,Stevie Wonder,1980,Hotter Than July,Lately,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask, ""Will you be coming back soon?""
You don't know, never know

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye"

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you
Baby

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love
From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss

Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do

I longed for you since I was born
A woman sensitive and warm
And that you were
With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have feminine finesse
And so much more

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best
Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do

The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go
Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world (Cold, too cold)

You took me riding in a rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped my Black ass
Down to this cold, cold world
...me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down into this cold, cold world
(I would not do that to a dog, baby)

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back

Will it say the love you feel for me?
Will it say that you will be by my side?
To see me through until my life is through

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

'cause in my mind, you will stay here always

When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Pop,Stevie Wonder,1967,I Was Made to Love Her,I Was Made to Love Her,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her""
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee-high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no

Pop,Stevie Wonder,1976,Songs In the Key of Life,If It’s Magic,"If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poet's endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time

If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

So
If it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone"

Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance

She takes another puff and says ""It's a crazy scene""
That red is green
And she's a tangerine

I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high
I'm too high

She's the girl in her life

She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice
She wasn't very nice

I'm too high
I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky
I'm too high
I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die

She's a girl of the past

She passed away
What did her friend say

They said she's too high

Just go have a talk with God

Pop,Stevie Wonder,1972,Music Of My Mind,Evil,"Evil, why have you engulfed so many hearts? Evil
Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds?
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide
Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred?
Evil, why have you stolen so much love?
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free
Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes? Evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be
Evil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world?
Evil, hey, evil, oh, why have you broken so many homes?
Leaving sweet love all alone, an outcast of the world"

I know they're out there, them beautiful men
But you my future, baby, you my right now
If there was a scale from one to ten
My love for you is a million billion

So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)

Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)

One for the lord and take it from the devil

Looking back, they're better than they used to be

And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving

And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
And the story goes on, and gets a little better
Every time we're together

It's funny how we change
And some things stay the same
God, I miss the glory days, always
Daylight getting near
We shed a few more tears

You call the house from time to time

Pop,Rascal Flatts,2004,Feels Like Today,Bless the Broken Road,"I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yeah)

Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you

Pop,Rascal Flatts,2003,Me And My Gang,What Hurts The Most,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

Pop,Rascal Flatts,2017,Back to Us,Yours If You Want It,"There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you

Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

It's yours if you want it

Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much

Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh

You couldn't feel the light

Gathered in our little hometown
This can't be the way

Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were

A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

Now in my mind I'll keep you frozen
As a seventeen-year-old
Rounding third to score the
Winning run
You always played with passion
No matter what the game
When you took the stage
You'd shine just like the sun

Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were

A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

Now the oak trees are swaying
In the early autumn breeze
A golden sun is shining on my face
Through tangled thoughts
I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that
Bad of a place

Oh why, there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to
Judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one
Burning question
Who told you life wasn't
Worth the fight
They were wrong, they lied

Walk away

Swear that I'm not trying to start no trouble
Tell your fiance he can relax
I'll leave you alone for good, I promise
There's a question I just got to ask

I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?

I know what we have is dead and gone
Too many times I made you cry
And I don't mean to interrupt your life
I just wonder, do I ever cross your mind?

I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?

But I don't want it back
I realized that
She don't know how to act
Never been a dumb dude, no, I'm not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking me, Earl James and Jimmy
Yep, she had plenty
But love for me, she didn't have any

I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That I'll be okay
Go on girl

Go on girl

I can't get it back
But I don't want it back
I realized that
She don't know how to act
Tried to settle down and look what I get
Thought it was my time, but I guess not yet
She at the bar getting drinks from many men
I'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends
Just not knowing, truly not knowing
I look back now like, ""Man, I was open""

I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong

The mistake I made is clear
(We never should've been together)
That's the reason you're not here

Not a single salty tear
Not a feeling in my chest
Baby, I'm feeling no stress
I'm too fly to be depressed

Don't you hate a could've would've should've nigga
(oh oh no, oh oh no)
Could've did, would've did, well you should've nigga
(oh oh no, oh oh no)

If I had a dollar for every should be, you know how rich I would be?
Like they say it is what it is, not what it could be
Can't cry, feel guilt over spilt milk
I'm too fly, I'm too cool, word to Versace silk
And my watch be filled with mad diamonds
I got good watches, just bad timing
The chick I met at the club was cute
Still feel like I'm getting brain from the substitute
Cause this ain't you and I ain't me
Claim you happy then why you so mad at me?
Can't hold on to what you had, just what you got
You should be here, but you're not

I'm doing it again
What I told myself I would not do, oh
It's 4:15 AM
I'm sitting here drinking, reminiscing on you, oh
And how I used to let you smoke even though I don't
You get blowed then we both get low
As I lay here with some girl I don't know
In the back of my mind, one millionth time
I tell myself it should be you, should be you
Should be you with me, right now
Said it should be you (should be you)
Should be you (should be you)
Should be you with me, right now, uh

As I watch her sleep, all that I can think
She's beautiful (beautiful), but she's not you
Love for just a night, then out of my life (out of my life)
Damn, why can't I do this right when you told me you wanted to leave? (wanted to leave)
I pretended it didn't hurt me (didn't hurt me)
But as I lay here, I can hardly breathe
Laying next to she, when in reality, it should be...

It should be you (oh), should be you (should be you)
Should be you with me, (with me) right now (right now)
Said it should be you (oh) should be you (oh oh)
Should be you with me (oh with me) right now (aha)
(ooh) should be you, should be you baby (ahh)

Ay yo check this out
My life, lights cameras fame and action
Feeling drained from all this private planes I'm catchin'
Willing to trade all the flashy chains I'm flashin for a night
Back for us, exchangin' pain in passion
Romances, kinda like the phantom doors we used to ride
Cause it's tryin' to open up, it's like suicide (suicide)
God teaches lessons every day
You was all I need in life, Meth and Mary J (come on)
The sun don't shine forever
Anytime that we fall, it just means we climb together (together)
Guess we avoided when we couldn't went through
That don't change the fact that it should'be been you

It should be you (oh), should be you, should be you
Should be you with me, right now, right now
Said it should be you, should be you
Should be you and me, right now (aha)
Uhh uhh, said it should be you, it should be you baby (ahh)"

So I'm chillin'
But I must admit, I'm kind of mad
Ain't every day you find one like that
Beautiful body with a brain to match
Make a fella start feeling attached
No filter fine, body, soul and mind
Any man can't see that, he must be blind
I'm Ray Charles with mine

She wanted me to give her more (to give her more)
But I told her though, ain't long ago
A relationship, I wasn't lookin' for
In and out of town and always on the road
But when I hit that city I called her though
And that's wrong (so wrong)
She waited for me to come around so long (so long)

She got a walk like she stalking prey
Them killer curves and that pretty face
And she gon' make you do just what she says
Licking them lips, swinging them hips as she come your way

You better run, run for your life
Oh oh you better run, run for your life oooh

Hips movin', yo ass pokin', young neck breaker
Dress stretching, eyes sparkling, you a breath taker
Heart stopper, need a chart topper
Groovy Q meets Big Pimpin'
St. Laurent for your Spring clothes
Red bottoms, you need those
All the things I do for you, oh
Got a private jet for two, oh
Yeah, we taking off or we can land in Rome
Pull away without the roof
All these things I do for you
How these bras come out the blue
God built you like a temple
How your body drive me schizo

You better run, run for your life
You better run, run for your life oh oh

Drowning in a sea of groupies, buckets and scallywags. Clinging to sanity by a thread, suffocating
When suddenly he spots her
Sexy and classy attire, very little makeup
Weave on point, buying her own damn drinks
And as the thot waves keep crashing
And attempt to bring my man down, behold sweet salvation
An island, Integrity Jones"

Pop,Sean Paul,2005,The Trinity,Never Gonna Be The Same,"As the reality of the times take hold
We come to terms with the sadness we bear
Missing the times we never get to share
(woh-woh) (woh-woh) (woh-woh)
(woh-woh) (woh-woh)
Just a few words because we care
Still I got all the memories
(woh-woh) (woh-woh) (woh-woh) (woh-woh)

Say, when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout all life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

Wish I could rewind all the hands of time and bring back
Daddigon a great bredren of mine, I...
Sit and remember all the things that we spoke of
All of the serious reasonings an all di tings we make jokes of
Still cannot believe them took your life away
But those who pull the trigger cannot take away
The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah
So I know I'll see you again my brother. (what me think)

Say, when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

Fi all the friends and families that have past on
Leaving impressions and memories that will last on
Giving thanks fi all the time that we know them
Reminisce them legacy that is what we owe them
Because the helped to make us who we are
So let us never forget and talk it near and far
Bless Up Grandpa Lee and Aunt Chris-I
Can't forget you if I try

Say, when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

Father Bogle (keep burnin up all the flame)
Simpleton (never gonna ever gonna be the same)
Peter Cargill (keep burnin up all the flame)
Shorty Malcolm (got memories inna mi brain)
Nicole Wynter (keep burnin up all the flame)
All friends and family....We'll never forget you all
(keep burning up the flame, the flame)
(Till Jah Jah link we again)

From when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout all life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

For all the friends that have passed on before
We pray that you rest in peace
And Jah keep you safe until we meet again"

Been working hard for years
Keep climbing up the stairs
Gotta know that you are ready there
Blood, sweat and the tears now
None of them can take your shares now
Enemies better be aware now
Champions got a lot to bare now
I'ma tell you this I'ma swear now
I are the tiger I got the stair now

But tomorrow will come
Hold on, hold on now now

All that you know seh the road is steep
Pain and trouble and try a long grief
But yuh must soak cah yuh must worry
Hard times never will get you beat
And you never will get defeat

Do the work, 'cause talk is cheap

My love for you was strong enough, you should've known
I never needed you for judgment
I never needed you to question what I spent
I never asked for help, I take care of myself
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me

There isn't anything for you to say

So look at me and listen to me, because

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush, hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say, because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush, hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken

I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words, I never needed hurt
I never needed you to be there every day
I'm sorry for the way I let go
On everything I wanted when you came along
But I ain't never beatin', broken not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong

Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But I spent oh so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
But I grew strong
I learned how to carry on
Hush hush, hush hush, I've already spoken
Our love is broken, baby
Oh no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give, but I will survive

And it ain't got to be no real reason

There's a door that opens
And the moment you walk in it closes

Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help

Pop,James Blunt,2004,Back to Bedlam,High,"Beautiful dawn
Lights up the shore for me
There is nothing else in the world
I'd rather wake up and see with you
Beautiful dawn
I'm just chasing time again
Thought I would die a lonely man
In endless night

But now I'm high
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me

Beautiful dawn (beautiful dawn)
Melt with the stars again
Do you remember the day when my journey began?
Will you remember the end of time?
Beautiful dawn  (beautiful dawn)
You're just blowing my mind again
Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine

High
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me

Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older?
Promise me tomorrow starts with you

Getting high
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
High
Running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me"
Pop,James Blunt,2017,The Afterlove,Someone Singing Along,"Somebody's gonna wave a flag
Somebody's going to attack
Someone will tell you to take a side
Tell you their version of wrong or right
Somebody's gonna let you in
Judged on the color of your skin
Slam a door in the face of your friend
Simply because you don't look like him

And then you gotta find a way that you're walkin'
Everybody's walkin'
You gotta find the words to say when you're talkin'
Everybody's talkin'

So I built the words into a song
I'm hopin' someone's singing along
And even if some notes are wrong
I'm hopin' someone's singing along
'cause just one voice is not enough
I need to hear from everyone
And even when I'm dead and gone
I'm hopin' someone's singing along

Somebody's gonna build a wall
Then smash it with a cannon ball
Someone who somehow has got a gun
Will tell you who you can't and you can love
Some people keeping all the cash
They're gonna get away with that
Just 'cause some people don't think like me
Does that really make them the enemy?

And then you gotta find a way that you're walkin'

Make a noise, I can hear you now
Won't you raise your voice just a little louder
Make a noise, I can hear you now
Won't you raise your voice just a little louder

So I built the words into a song
I'm hopin' someone's singing along

You would wait by the phone
Every time I was gone, but all along

I want you to make me better

You made me laugh out loud, you do
You give me memories like time is frozen
You gave me a child and he's got your smile

About all the dreams I'm chasing
And I have been wrong
With the things that I've done 'cause all along

Didn't come with a warning
But fame is unkind
Put me on top of the world
Couple of girls and then
Left me behind

Sure, let's take a photograph
You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'd tell you what I'm doing now
But you don't really wanna know

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Tell me how to write one better

I'm not gonna lie
Say it didn't work out
'cause I live in a big house
Made a few pounds
Nice car on the drive
And I went round the world once or twice
Saw the sunset and sunrise
But for big highs, there's a big price
When all you do is criticise

It’s 72 degrees
Zero chance of rain
It’s been a perfect day
We’re all spinning on our heels
So far away from real
In California
We watched the sunset from our car
We all took it in
And by the time that it was dark
You and me had something, yeah!

And if this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night
You'll stay the night

We’ve been singing Billie Jean
Mixin’ vodka with caffeine
We’ve got strangers stopping by
And though you’re out of tune
Girl you blow my mind, you do
And I’ll say I don’t wanna say good night
There’s no quiet corner to get to know each other
And there’s no hurry I’m a patient man
As your discover

And if this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night
You'll stay the night

Just like the song on our radio set
We’ll share the shelter of my single bed
But it’s a different tune that’s stuck in my head
And it goes…

And if this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know

We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know

But in time all the flowers
Yes, in time all the flowers turn to face the sun

Yeah, you say what you say
Then you do it to me anyway
You do what you do
Then you walk away, you walk away
You say what you say
Then you do it to me anyway
You do what you do
Yeah, I know, it's true

And God knows that it’s hard to find the one

Pop,James Blunt,2004,Back to Bedlam,Cry,"I have seen peace
I have seen pain
Resting on the shoulders of your name
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?

And if you want to talk about it anymore
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder
I'm a friend

I have seen birth
I have seen death
Lived to see a lover's final breath
Do you see my guilt?
Should I feel a fright?
Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?

And if you want to talk about it once again
On you I depend
I'll cry on your shoulder
You're a friend

You and I have lived through many things
I'll hold on to your heart
I wouldn't cry for anything
But don't go tearing your life apart

I have seen fear
I have seen faith
Seen the look of anger on your face
And if you want to talk about what will be
Come and sit with me and cry on my shoulder
I'm a friend

And if you want to talk about it anymore
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder
Once again
Cry on my shoulder
I'm a friend"
Pop,James Blunt,2007,All the Lost Souls,I’ll Take Everything,"Oooh, these feet carry me far
Oh, my body, oh so tired
Mouth is dry, hardly speak
Holy Spirit, rise in me

Here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

And I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone
When I die

Have my body
Have my mind
Have my coat
Take my time
These I borrow
Borrow so far
Turn to dust
Fall apart

Here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

And I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone
And understand
'Cause all men die
'Cause all men die

And I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone
Since I'm gonna die

I'll take everything
In this life
I'll join everyone

Pop,James Blunt,2013,Moon Landing,Miss America,"Did someone give you something to help you ease the pain?
Like the liquor in the bottle, we watched you slip away
And I feel as if I know you through the bars of a song
Always surrounded but alone

But no goodbyes, you’ll always be Miss America
We watched you fly, but nothing’s free Miss America
And as you fall apart, we just call it art
Was it so hard to breathe?

Was the picture in the paper not the face you recognise?
Did the make up never make up for the pain behind your eyes?
Cos I feel as if I know when you’re on my silver screen
But I don’t know the dark places that you’ve been

But no goodbyes, you’ll always be Miss America
We watched you fly, but nothing’s free Miss America
And as you fall apart, we just call it art
Was it so hard to breathe?

Does another voice sing in Heaven’s choir tonight
To fill the silence left behind?
And I don’t know what goes on in your mind
I’m sure it’s enough to make me cry
Someday we’ll find you lived forever

But no goodbyes, you’ll always be Miss America
We watched you fly, but nothing’s free Miss America
And as you fall apart, we just call it art
Was it so hard to breathe?"
Pop,James Blunt,2004,Back to Bedlam,Billy,"Billy's leaving today
Don't know where he's going
Holds his head in disgrace
He can't escape the truth
He knows the price that he's paid
He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid

Tomorrow comes
Sorrow becomes his soul mate
The damage is done
The prodigal son is too late
Old doors are closed but he's always open
To relive time in his mind
Oh Billy

Billy's leaving today
Don't know where he's going
He's got lines on his face
They tell the story of his pain
He accepts it's his fate
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong


Once he was a lover sleeping with another
Now he's just known as a cheat
And he wish he'd had a mirror
Looked a little clearer
Seen into the eyes of the weak (2x)"

All the things that do seem
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I wanna be
So no tears, no tears for me

Yeah I've bathed in sunshine
But cherished the fading light
And I heard my heartbeat falter
On a winters night
I loved a woman
But she didn't hear my prayers
So lord, oh lord, I'm yours
No tears

For the life that you lead
You had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the air?
All the things that do seem
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I wanna be

Because someone somewhere's going home tonight
Try to understand the sacrifice
So save your tears for those left behind

Will you go down on me?

Cause Annie you're a star, that's just not going very far
And all the world will know your name
And you'll be famous as you are
Cause I'll sing for you

Annie, would it be nice to be recognised?
And did you practise your autograph but now no one's asked and it's such a shame
That the dreams are crumbling?
Annie, why aren't you bathed in the limelight?
Cause I thought that you said you'd be a celebrity several years ago
Did it all come tumbling down, down

In your eyes

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out
But it paid for the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
Cause they're all just slaves to the gods they made
But you and I just shone
Just shone

And when silence greets my last goodbye
The words I need are in your eyes, and I'll sing"

She's another victim of life, we've come to know
Technology, celebrity, all the things you cannot hold
She's from a long lost tribe looking for the light
Or a friend to hold her hand
She's doing the best she can

Seems that everyone we knows is
Out there waiting by a phone
Wondering why they feel alone
In this life

Are we all just satellites?
Where's the love? Show me tonight
Here's the moment we unite
All we know - life's just a dream
Who the hell knows what it means?
Stop the world and sing with me

All her memories have been
Experienced through
High speed on a video screen
That's all she ever knew
Did you know none of it's real if you can't feel
The beating of someone's heart
Don't leave yourself in the dark



Are we satellites?"

Out on a dance to the moon
Too soon

And they'll say told you so
We were the ones who saw you first of all
We always knew that you were one of the brightest stars

One day they'll tell you that you've changed
Though they're the ones who seem to stop and stare
One day you'll hope to make the grave
Before the papers choose to send you there

Turn your radio on
And you'll hear this simple song
That I made up
That I made up for you
When you're driving
Turn the radio up
'Cause I can't sing loud enough
Hard these days
To get my message through

If time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

When you marry
And you look around
I'll be somewhere in that crowd
Torn up, that it isn't me
When you're older
And the memories fade
I know I'll still feel the same
For as long as I live

If time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

Won't you say my name, one time
Please just say my name

If time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping awake
If time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you

They're gonna push until you give in or say when

Now we're here, and it turns to chaos

Every plan turns another century
Around again, another nation has fallen

Maybe God can be on both sides
Of the gun, never understood why
Some of us never get it so good, so good
Some of this was here before us
All of this will go after us

But you are gone, not for good, but for now
And gone for now feels a lot like gone for good

Happiness is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
Happiness was never mine to hold
Careful child, light the fuse and get away
'Cause happiness throws a shower of sparks
Yeah, yeah

Happiness damn near destroys you
Breaks your faith to pieces on the floor
So you tell yourself that's enough for now

Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything

If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same

I know the memory is rushing into your mind
I want to kiss your scars tonight
You got to try, you got to let me in
Let me in

It washed us out to sea

Of our broken plans

We're gonna get it back

We were built to last

Changin' tides
Baby, that's the hardest part of life
Hold me tight

There's no doubt the beauty that we see
Followin' the path, so much older than we

Above the ragin' waters and the darkness underneath

Changin' tides
Baby, that's the hardest part of life
Hold me tight

Pop,The Fray,2005,How to Save a Life,Heaven Forbid,"Twenty years, it's breaking you down
Now that you understand there's no one around
Take a breath, just take a seat
You're falling apart and tearing at the seams

Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight, wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright

It's on your face, is it on your mind?
Would you care to build a house of your own?
How much longer, how long can you wait?

Pop,The Fray,2009,The Fray,Enough for Now,"The daughter's father watches, quietly we assume
He's no longer with us, but he left this dusty room
In your name and it's an honor, it's a shame, but it's your honor
Take it on your shoulder 'til you can find another

That's enough for now, he should've never left you broken
He should've held you, things your father never could do
That's enough for now, he would've never left you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you

The century before you never could turn 21
Years and years he waited just watching for a son
For someone to go ahead, take the name he said
Years and years he waited and a daughter came instead

But that's enough for now, he should've never left you broken
He should've held you, things your father never could do
That's enough for now, he would've never left you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you

Breathing comes in pairs
Except for twice
One begins and one's goodbye
Sixty years of sorrow, he got five or six of bliss
Left my mother's mother without so much as a kiss
As a kiss

But that's enough for now, never wanted to leave you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you
That's enough for now, I would've never left you broken
I would've held you, things your father never could do
Words your father never told you

Sixty years of sorrow, he got five or six of bliss
Left my mother's mother without so much as a kiss"
Pop,The Fray,2012,Scars & Stories,Run for Your Life,"Seventeen years by her side, broke the same bread
Wore the same clothes and you said
""We're sisters with nothing between, if one of us fall
The other will soon be following""

Both of you fell the same day and you don't know why
But one of you never woke up
You lay your body down on the floor, you're desperate to hear
Her footsteps again, but this house is on fire
And we need to go

Oh, you don't have to go it alone, go it alone

Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
I will be close behind, run for your life

She had a fire inside and that terrified you
You swore that you'd never lose your control
Baby, let yourself go, 'cause part of you hides
And I know the hunger inside of you is strong
You can only hold back the river so long

Oh, you don't have to go it alone
Oh, you don't have to go it alone, go it alone

Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how
I'll come back with you and take all that's true
And leave all that's burned behind
Run for your life

Oh, you don't have to go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone

Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how

Pop,The Fray,2012,Scars & Stories,The Fighter,"The lover held her love
She begged him not to go
The fighter wrapped his gloves
The fighter said I know, I know, I know
Just this one last time
I swear you'll still be mine
But he can't promise much
He goes for one last touch, one last touch

Maybe we were meant to be lonely, lonely
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
Loneliness has always been with me, with me
But maybe we don't have to be all alone

The fighter goes inside
The doubt is creeping in
He swings with all his might
At all that might have been
And she's in love with him
But lovers don't always win
He never even saw the swing
She calls out his name, calls his name

Maybe we were meant to be lonely, lonely
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
Loneliness has always been with me, with me
But maybe we don't have to be all alone

What breaks your bones
Is not the load you're carrying
What breaks you down
Is all in how you carry it

The lover held her love
She begged him not to go
She unwrapped his gloves
The lover said I know, I know, I know
Kissed his trembling lips
She touched his fingertips
But somehow they both know
He's not coming home, coming home

Loneliness has always been with me, with me
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
But I got to try or it will destroy me
'Cause maybe we don't have to be all alone"

I'll keep you warm
Dancing in a downpour
And I will hold
Your body slowly turning
I'll keep you warm
Dancing in a downpour
Breathe it in, take it off
And soak our skin
She's in a town that holds a lonely road
And the night is falling
There's a road that follows to a home
And the sky is heavy
In the home she's in a lonely room
With music playing
Can she hear my heart coming through
On the door between
I'll keep you warm
Dancing in a downpour
And I will hold
Your body slowly turning
I'll keep you warm
Dancing in a downpour
Breathe it in, take it off
And soak our skin
Maybe I'll find you
Maybe I won't
Baby, I'll try to
Even if I don't
You are what I never knew I needed
What I never knew I needed
What I never knew I needed
We're almost there

Help me stand

Pop,The Fray,2009,The Fray,Be the One,"They're two lovers in the night waiting on the sun to rise
Passing ships into the night under different skies
Would you just whisper what you said one last time
I could have sworn I heard you say that you are mine

Fading flowers in your hand, the best that I could do
It's the only way I've had of reaching you
Never saw it like you did, didn't know that it was there
You don't see it in your head, it's in the air

Be the one and only
Wait for me, will you be the only one
Will you be, be the one and only
Wait for me, will you be the only one

What if I knew how to yell, what would I pray
What if I knew how to tell, what would I say
I will be the only one if you say you'll never go
I'll be screaming out your name from the back road

Be the one and only
Wait for me, will you be the only one
Will you be, be the one and only
Wait for me, will you be the only one

Pop,The Fray,2014,Helios,Wherever This Goes,"We could slow down, waste away in this town
Standing on the sidewalk, watching this parade
Or we could get out, pack our suitcase right now
Find ourselves a bus stop, make our own way

'Cause it feels like I've been here forever
Afraid to be my father and afraid to leave him too
But it's my name painted on the doorway
Tells me where I came from and what I've got to do

Wherever this goes, no matter how far
Baby, you are the song that's written on my heart
Wherever we stand, wherever we fall
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
From this moment 'til the day the curtains close
Wherever this goes

So we're here now, finally found our way out
On the road to someplace, someplace that we don't know
But it's alright, we'll keep on driving all night
Straight on through 'til morning, I know which way to go

'Cause it feels like we've been here forever
Don't know how much farther or where we're going to
But it's our name painted on the doorway
Tells us where we came from and what we got to do

Wherever this goes, no matter how far
Baby, you are the song that's written on my heart
Wherever we stand, wherever we fall
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
From this moment 'til the day the curtains close
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours

And so they move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown

I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door

If I could trade his life for mine

The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time

I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side

When love is true

Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I finally see

Short and stubby, and, my gosh, look how much you weigh
You're pinkish red, got this thing on your head, and woah
Girl, you couldn't look better
Shake the sleep off and kick into the morning drill
It's another awesome day here in Uglyville
Grab your shoes, time to spread the good news, woah
Things just couldn't be better

Call it hope or faith, whatever
I just know in my heart, it's the day I've waited forever

'Cause there's a scrambled sun in a tangled sky
And the moon couldn't be any brighter
And as the slam big city goes rocketing by
Oh, my head couldn't feel any lighter
It's like a funhouse ride, the kind you just can't miss
Call it crazy, and yet, is there anything better than this?
Life just couldn't be better than this

Nevermind that, I'll tell you what the day'll bring
First a shindig, then a bash, then more partying
Top it all with a rave, then a ball (oh, woah-oh)
Yeah, you know it couldn't be better
Morning Loxy, got something new you wanna try?
It's a brownie cupcake fudge berry ice cream pie
Just one bite, who these kids? Am I right? Babo
It just couldn't taste better

And soon, you-know-what is coming
But until it arrives, might as well keep the party humming, yeehaw

Yes, it's a square peg life in a round hole town
But the folks couldn't be any sweeter (Sweeter)
It may be upside backwards and wrong side down
But it just couldn't feel more completer

And there's so much to do
And it's all such bliss
There's no reason to fret
What could ever be better than this?
No, it couldn't get better than

Stop the press, ugly dog is here
Story of the day, of the month, of the year
Here's a little scoop on the way down low
Check-check-check out the flow
The cats are rapping, lobster snapping
But only the dog makes the party happen
So put in your paper, seal it with a kiss
It couldn't bet better than this

Another madhouse night in a crazy quilt world
And our hearts couldn't soar any higher
We've got our freak flags flying, completely unfurled
And we just couldn't be more fire
And life's a nonstop blast, it's utter awesomeness
Yeah, it's crazy, you bet, but it couldn't get better than this
It's crazy, you bet, it could never get better than this
Could never be better than this
Could it be better than this?

Guess another sun has set
And another moon has smiled
I'm still just one more doll
Still waiting for her child
I'm sure it's gonna happen
Just like the story says
There's a new day 'round the corner
And it just might be the day"

All we want is to keep it together

And all these tears are from the dust in our eyes
And all these years just keep on passin' us by
And all this misery makes it hard to deny
We all know that we're just born to die
That's the way it goes when you're just born to die

I hear the voice of a whip-poor-will singin'
She don't know all the comfort she's bringin'
We all know the sound of when the truth is ringin'
Yeah, it hurts your soul just like a bumblebee stingin'

All these tears are from the dust in our eyes

Pop,Kelly Clarkson,2015,Piece by Piece,Someone,"So this is my apology
For saying all those shitty things
I wish I didn't really mean
I'm sorry, I'm not sorry
You had your red flags up and raised
More traffic than East L.A
But I drove in anyway
My common sense on holiday
People fall outta phase
We were a crash course
We will just be a place
Stuck on your passport
You traveled to sometime
But I hope you will find

Someone to cry for
Someone to try for
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets
Someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be
The reason you breathe
The reason you breathe

You stay in love like vacation homes
You like summers on the sunny coast
But when the cold needs a winter coat
You say you will until you don't
You wore a compass around your neck
A different North than we’d ever read
Well, did you get where you're going yet?
Wish you the worst, wish you the best
I don't know how I fell into your rear-view
Paralyzed lullabies, I couldn't hear you
So I hope you were right
And next to you tonight

Someone to cry for
Someone to try for
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets
Someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be

Pop,Kelly Clarkson,2003,Thankful,The Trouble With Love Is,"Mmm, ooh, yeah
Mmmm

Love can be a many splendored thing
Can't deny the joy it brings
A dozen roses, diamond rings
Dreams for sale and fairy tales
It'll make you hear a symphony
And you just want the world to see
But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool you every time

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See, you've got no say at all, oh

Now I was once a fool, it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sad, but I'm wiser too
I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See, you've got no say at all

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps calling and I keep on falling
Over and over again
This sad story always ends the same
Me standing in the pouring rain
It seems no matter what I do
It tears my heart in two

(The trouble with love is) The trouble with love, yeah
(It can tear you up inside) It can tear you up inside
(Make your heart believe a lie) Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride

(The trouble with love is)
It's in your heart
It's in your soul (Doesn't care how fast you fall)
You won't get no control (And you can't refuse the call)
See, you've got no say at all

Pop,The Black Eyed Peas,2003,Elephunk,Where Is the Love?,"What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Then why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (one world, one world)
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)
And something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with the w-w-world
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)"

Know thyself and you can do anything
Know thyself and you could shine like bling
Know thyself and you the king of the ring, ha
But they don't teach kids nothing
All they know is iPad, sugar in their muffin
They don't know division, don't add to nothing
Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing
He in the streets cause he always cuttin'
The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'
All they do was stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em with stuff he can't use
So he sell crack, that's what he know to do
His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too
And that's why you see the lil' killer in the news
It's kinda like they got us in a trap
It's kinda like they knowin' how we act
I'll be like ""fuck your fuckin' laboratory, I am not a rat""
I am light, I am God body, wise to the fact
Wake up!

Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Wake up!

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Pt.2
Shh
Wake up!
Wake up!

Eyes open, who's watching the watchers?
Clock ticking like we're running out of options
Villains in the White House, heroes in their coffins
Leaders double cross while we kneeling to our crosses
Whose policing the police, why they stalking?
All lives matter 'til your color is the target
Fox running up the sheep for the slaughter
Money over people while they reaching for that dollar
All I see's lies on the screen
Land of the free, but what the fuck's free?
What does it cost to let a nigga breathe?
King had a dream but we all still asleep, huh
They robbed you blind and knowledge is a crime
The shit's designed to keep you on a grind
Rise and shine 'cause now it's the time
We all God body if you open up your mind
Wake up!

Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Pt.3
Ain't nothing impossible, I tell myself
That I am possible, I know that devil
Is out there and plotting those plans
To stop me and put me in hospital bed
I said ""Yo, I will not be toppled
I'm down with Jesus and I roll with apostles""
We got that big love, that love that's colossal
We meditate, ain't no need to get hostile
You cannot penetrate me with the hate
We got that good vibration on vibrate
Stay on that way up 'cause we elevate
We got that big love, that love heavyweight

Wait, wait, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Ha, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel

I tell them, yo
The movement's unstoppable
Pausing the flow, that is not optional
I let 'em know, everything's solvable
When you know science, everything is plausible
I am defiant, I'm also logical
Politicians be tripping, they comical
So I sit back and listen to audio
Spiritual hip-hop, I call that hypnoticals
We Budda-Boy, B-Boy phenomenals
We Zulu-kill zombies in chronicles
We ain't falling 'cause we ain't dominoes
That revolution is on go, go

Go, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Yup, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel

Pop,The Black Eyed Peas,2018,MASTERS OF THE SUN VOL. 1,STREET LIVIN’,"Streets, streets
Livin' in the streets

Street livin', caught in the trap
Guns or books, sell crack or rap
Be like kings or be like pawns
They called us coons, now they call us cons
Street niggas be packing pistols
Terrorists be blasting missiles
Crips and Bloods and retail thugs
CIA planes bring Colombian drugs in
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to hell
The teachers in my neighborhood can hardly spell
And compare to them, prison guards get paid well
Ten years no bail is 4 years at Yale
So, forget about the statue of General Lee
Because the status of blacks are generally
Gonna end up in some penitentiary
Systematically, that's how they made it to be
Listen, they derailed the soul train
And put a nightmare in every Martin Luther King
And privatized prisons are owned by the same
Slave masters that owned the slave trade game
And racists no longer have to be racist
'Cause niggas kill more niggas than the KKK did
Now, every time I hear a new def jam
Niggas killing niggas like they Ku Klux Klan
I understand what's a nigga to choose?
Be the killer or be the dead dude in the news
I get it, what's a nigga to do?
No education in the hood got a nigga confused

Street livin', tough conditions
Brainwashed by the television
We lost in the world we live in
Double cross love lost no religion
Street livin', oh my gosh
Another brother got shot by the searg'
Another cop got off with no charge
If you black in the hood, you at large
You're guilty until you prove you're innocent
If you're ivory, they treat you different
If you're ebony, they assume your temperament
Will be vigilant and they call you militant
And you'll get shot and they'll say the incident
Is 'cause you're belligerent, what a coincidence?
Born and bred but you're still an immigrant
And if you ain't dead, you can see imprisonment

There's more niggas in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
There's more niggas that's rotting in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
So, how we gon' get up out the trap?
Guns or books, sell crack or rap
Street livin', hustle or hoops
Guns or books, get shot or shoot

Street livin', ain't no rules
Break the law, make the breakin' news
The life you choose could be the life you lose
Niggas getting stuck for the Nike shoes
Street livin', ain't no joke
It's a cold world, better bring your coat
Revoke 'cause the streets are broke
And now they wanna take away our dreams and hopes
Street livin', no economics
No way out of the Reaganomics
Infected by the black plague, new bubonic
No comprende, we speak ebonics
Street livin', what's your position?
You can take action or take a dick and listen
You can get fucked by the system
Or you can say ""fuck the system"""
Pop,The Black Eyed Peas,2005,Monkey Business,Don’t Lie,"Yeah, uh-uh
La, da, da, da, da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I been tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after what you did, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie ('cause)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try (Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)

She said ""I'm leavin'""
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

Oh, when I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
(And now our emotions are drained)
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (no, don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try (got to, got to try)

When I really see you and what you all are about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie

Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one that make me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it

Oh, when I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
Till there's not turning back
I don't know why and I lie and I lie
Till I don't know who I am
Let me tell myself

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try (you know, you know you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you and what you all are about?

And do it to 'em right away

We should just pow-wow, and all of us meet up
And fight for each other, not one another
And when we talk, be nice to each other
Be cordial, be glad, be happy, not sad
Stay in your bag
And all of my banger that bang with they flag
Whether Crip or Blood, be good to each other
Be hood to each other in the house-a, mi casa su casa
On and on, love that we givin' keeps rollin' on, rollin' on

In my mind's eye had a Maybach then
Fast forward now, Maybach's what I'm in
Getting out the project was the project
Momma said ""progress is the process""
I was paid less shopped at the Payless
Now my ass is living in a nice address
Feeling like a champ living up in Los Feliz
Way back when I just wanted dope feelings
A Kangol and a tracksuit from Adidas
Now we over here selling 80,000 seaters
Yeah they wanna see us when we coming to the town
'Cause we number one with the champion sound
We be falling up, ne-never falling down

From Angeles to Los Angeles
No handouts, they don't wanna hand me shit
Now they analyze me calling all the analysts
Now they realize that I'm the catalyst
On the Bob Marley shit, I'm the activist
And no I ain't talking 'bout no cannabis
Born Filipino, born philanthropist
I know I wouldn't be the guy 'bout the bullshit
Know wise from the dumb all about the school shit

Bridging the gap, close all the wedges

(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

We don't want war- can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need an antidote and a cure
Cause do you really think Muhammad got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Cause the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, differences and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonise together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilising all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
(One for all, one for all)

Pop,Natasha Bedingfield,2010,Strip Me,Touch,"I was tryna cross the street when I tripped and spilled my coffee
On a man who yelled at me, then he walked off in a hurry
Now he's gonna be late for work, so he called his secretary
Said to cancel his appointment with the guy in the lobby

Who's been waiting for a while and talking on the phone
Got invited to a party and thought he couldn't go
But he's here right now, standing in my house
And someone turns the music loud

So we dance and we laugh, and we touch (Touch, touch, touch)
Yeah, we dance and we laugh, and we touch (Touch, touch, touch)
Gonna party all night 'til the sun comes up
'Cause it feels like the world disappears around us
When we dance, when we laugh, when we touch

I was planning out my party, running errands 'round the city
Grocery bags full of alcohol and chocolate chip cookies
Saw a dress that was amazing in the window of a boutique
So I went to across the street, then my heel broke and it threw me

I tried to catch my balance, but I was supposed to fall
It seems that spilling coffee was no accident at all
'Cause you're here right now, sitting on my couch
Funny how it all works out

So we dance and we laugh, and we touch (Touch, touch, touch)
Yeah, we dance and we laugh, and we touch (Touch, touch, touch)
Gonna party all night 'til the sun comes up
'Cause it feels like the world disappears around us
When we dance, when we laugh, when we touch

Every choice we make, and every road we take
Every interaction starts a chain reaction
We're both affected when we least expected it
And when we touched, then it all connected
Every choice we make, and every road we take
Every interaction starts a chain reaction
We're both affected when we least expected it
And when we...

When we dance, and we laugh, and we touch

When we dance, when we laugh, when we touch

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, no!)

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This ""love sick"" thing
I like serious relationships and, uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me
And I'm back!

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (In love!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, God!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love!)
Can't help it (Ooh, whoo, ooh!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now, baby!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now!)
She can't help it (And now you got me)

You got me trippin' (Oh), stumblin' (Oh), flippin' (Oh), fumblin'

The first time impressions, your truest expression

This feeling, can't lose it, it's better to use it
To find out, discover how we like each other
The mystery, not knowing
Why can't we be showing our secrets, the magic?

New memories, new faces, subplotted, embrace it
With kisses, ""I love you's,"" below and above you

Pop,Fergie,2008,The Dutchess,Finally,"Mmm, mmm

Ever since I was a baby girl, I had a dream
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day
But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes
I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold
This classic story told, I left it in the cold
Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth

I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know, I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally, now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally, now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him, finally
Mmm

I remember the beginning, you already knew
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool
Fronting like it didn't matter, I just ran away
But on another phase, was lost in my own space
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
Scared to give up me, afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the mess that I had made

I finally got out of my own way
I finally started living for today
I finally know, I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally, now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally, now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him, finally

Mmm
Finally, finally

Finally, now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something beautiful is happening, is happening
Finally, now my life doesn't seem so bad

I already know what my addiction is
(I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love)
I shop for purses while love walks out the door
(Don't cry, buy a bag and get over it)
And, I'm not concerned with all the politics
(It's a lot of men, I know I could find another)
What I know is that I'm always happy
When I walk out the store, store
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Tryna to walk a mile in my kicks

Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?

Buying things is hard to say
Rocking Christian Audigier

Pop,Fergie,2017,Double Dutchess,A Little Work [Visual Experience Transcript],"I got to a point where I was seeing devils everywhere. Devil faces. Creatures that would appear to me in which they'd fly, fly, fly, and not even maybe saying it, but just looking at me and flying around. I would constantly be in this state of listening to the messages that all these characters and these demons or creatures, what, what they were going to tell me and what their messages were, and what I should do, and life became almost like this, this whole game. I was just gonna lose it, I was about to start screaming at everybody on the street. I ended up on Wilshire and I saw this church and I was, you know, there's nobody in there. I started going through the different aisles and started to pray. I saw the altar, and panicked. I, I, I thought, ""This is it. They're all out there. That's it. This is it. This is the moment.""
Got a lot of answers I'm looking for in these meds
'Bout time I talk to somebody, shrink my head
A lot of promises, broken things that were said
And I can't get out of this bed
Got bruises on my heart, plenty scars on my mind
Got blisters under the band-aid over my life
Gonna rip it open and show the world what's there
Lord knows I'm not perfect

When everything around me starts to fall
I rise up again to the call

We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little work
I, I have journals of it all, and I, I remember writing to myself throughout, you know, the periods of my life. That's how I can divulge my true feelings because it's been difficult to trust for me in my life. So the paper was always where I could emotionally get to those, those, those crevices, those little corners of feelings. I'm so glad I did it because at least I was checking in with myself. At least I knew that I was becoming a fuck-up.
Gotta wait, first of the month to pick up that check
He bounced, left, it was over, never came back
Had a lot of questions 'bout daddy after he left
Now it's just momma and them kids, and she said
""I'll hold her down, don't you worry, we'll find a way
No matter how, I'll make sure the bills get paid""
She gave it all and thank God their mouths got fed
She prayed the cycle would end

When everything around me starts to fall
I rise up again to the call

We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little work
I had to really work hard at telling the spirit, the vision, to go away. I had to say it out loud: ""Leave me alone, I choose the good."" It was just this epiphany I had in the, in the war, that I believe in the holy war, the war between good against evil and that good will always be more powerful.

My grandfather, I always thought he was my guardian angel. My, my Grandpa Gore on my, uh, mom's side. And so I thought that he was leading me, telling me where to go, in the good direction. You gotta honor that part of yourself and let yourself fly, let yourself soar. And that's really taking those steps and getting there are those steps, and that battle, that fight in your mind, it's all here, and it's all internal, and it's making those little, those choices that are the hardest choices to make because they're not comfortable. They don't feel good all the time, making those choices, because they're the right ones to make.
I rise up again to the call

I was living in an alternate, parallel universe to what was really going on in the world. I kept feeling like this weird kinetic energy through my body. Feel it around me, it was all encompassing. It was like this crazy laser camera that was following me. They're watching, everybody's watching. They're all gonna get me, the SWAT team, everything. This was real fear, serious fear.
Sometimes when you feel like you need it
They send in the medic, woah
But if it's your soul that is bleeding
That slow drip won't help it, no
It's time to get up to the front of the line
The guards of the battle and straight for the mind
Well, well, well, well
There's nothing that's holding you down
Stuck on the ground, far from the crown
'Cause you are a warrior more than you know

We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little work
That walk out of there, all of that, that demon that was there, it all of a sudden felt like it just lifted, and it was almost like walking into the light. And I've realized that I finally needed to honor myself and that, uh, is really a, a, still a, a challenging place, that I, that I often have to work on to this day. But when I honor my true self, and I honor that part of me that is that magic, that's when I am at that place that I can call happy. I can feed that love outward, not only to friends and to my parents and to my sister, and now to my husband and to my little boy."

Dissolve the nerves that just begun
Listening to Marvin (all night long)

Ya I like the way your soul sounds to me
Ain't nobody do me the way you do me
I got the stamina for L-O-V-E
Whip out the camera lets make a movie
In the future we could look back at what we done did
We'll be makin love til we like a hundred

Cause you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne that you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition, it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you

So who am I to judge you on the past girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothin' like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me
Down right now, it's too late
I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

Uh, yeah, uh, look
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl quit playin' you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall

I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?

That took place not long ago
Bout an angel up in heaven
They say she up and ran away from home
Word is she had unfinished business
So back on earth she had to flee
Well you know I'm so elated
Because she's laying right here next to me
And when God woke up that morning
And he called out her name
And when she did not answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the same
 Heaven will never be the same 
Always dreamed that it would happen
I just didn't know exactly where
All my life I'd been waiting for something amazing
Said it took a while but now I know
So tell me can I get a witness
If you believe in miracles
And the proof I have is living
And my life will never ever be
And your life don't to be the...
At times it seems we take for granted
How precious life can be
Just hold on and I'm sure you'll understand it
Bringing into this world
A precious boy or a girl...And when God woke up that morning
Said where has my little angel gone
And when she didn't an...answer
Heaven will never ever ever be
Heaven will never be the....same

Saw you looking at me, saw you peaking out from under moon beams
Through the palm trees
Swaying in the breeze

And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do
Don't know how it happened, don't know why, but you don't really need a reason
When the stars shine
Just to fall in love
Made to love each other, made to be together for a life time
In the sunshine
Flying in the sky

We're both to blame for it, I'm sure
But tell me one thing, if another man said your name
Would it still sound poetic?
If so fuck it then, don't really wanna live
Just call the cops on me

And tell 'em I'm jumping out of the window with my heart on fire
Flying fast as the wind goes as I chase the moonlight
Love grows like a crescendo and it take me high
So I'm jumping out of the window with my heart on fire, tonight

Way up, way up
Way up, way up

These past 2 years we could fill up a room with tears
From the floor to the ceiling
We could feel the sun even through a thunderstorm
The floods won't reach the gates, I'm sure
The climb did changed now I'm carrying
Always rains but you still love the weather
If so fuck it then, don't really wanna leave
Just call the press on me

Now I'm jumping and falling and calling and screaming your name
Glasses and pieces I'm clearing it off of your veins
How many stories have fallen, where do I begin?
The damage is done, you can tell by the cuts in my skin
Ain't no running away from all of the painful things
If my heart is to  you know it'll leave a stain
I see your foot on the ledge, I know that you feel the same

Kiss you right below your navel then rub you with oil
Bite on your ear
Till you stand up make you turn around and touch your toes
The next thing girl, you already know


Better yet, enough of the talking
Cause the Patron says it's time to get it popping
Bartender swipe the black card I'm walking

Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

Como tú me tientas, cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé por qué me tienes en lista de espera
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no, y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera

Oh, here we go
You a part of me now
You a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you

Ohh, ohh

I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go

S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet

Vuelan los ángeles sobre Berlín
Van entonando junto a mí un aleluya
Mientras la lluvia cae dentro de mí

Extraño tu voz
Estoy en tierra de nadie
Me falta hasta el aire
De espaldas al sol
Pasa otro día sin tí

No sirve de nada llegar aún más lejos
Ni toda la fama, ni todo el dinero
No sirve de nada si no estás conmigo
Y la soledad se me clava en los huesos
No sirve de na ah-ah nada
Na ah-ah nada
Oh oh Na-a-a-da no oh
Na-a-a-da
No, no, no, no

Nadie adivina que depara el destino
Nuestro camino aún esta a medio hacer
Tiro mi bolso Chanel del barrio chino
Al suelo mojado y me lanzo a correr

Extraño tu voz
Me hace falta tocarte
Olerte, mirarte
De espaldas al sol
Acaba otro día sin ti

No sirve de nada llegar aún más lejos
Ni toda la fama, ni todo el dinero
No sirve de nada si no estás conmigo
Y la soledad se me clava en los huesos
No sirve de na ah-ah nada
Ah ah-ah nada
Oh oh na-a-a-da no oh

16
Lo que empieza no termina
Del mini bar al edén
Y en muy mala compañía
Era ese sabor en tu piel
A azufre revuelto con miel
Así que me llené de coraje y me fui a caminar por el lado salvaje
Pensé ""no me mires así""
Ya sé lo que quieres de mí
Que no hay que ser vidente aquí
Para un mal como tú no hay cuerpo que aguante

Lo hecho está hecho
Volví a tropezar con la misma piedra que hubo siempre
Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
Y contigo nunca es suficiente

¿Cómo fue?
¿Qué pasó?
Esa noche
Impaciente
Fueron a llamar
La de recepción
Cuando se quejaban de la 17
No puede ser nada normal
Acabar eligiendo tan mal
En materia de hombres soy toda una experta siempre en repetir mis errores
No hay ceguera peor
Que no querer mirar
Cuando te guardabas el anillo dentro del bolsillo y dejarlo pasar

Lo hecho está hecho
Volví a tropezar con la misma piedra que hubo siempre
Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
Y contigo nunca es suficiente

Nunca me sentí tan fuera de lugar
Nunca tanto se escapó de mi control
Pero todo en este mundo es temporal
Lo eres tú y lo soy yo
Nunca me sentí tan fuera de lugar
Nunca tanto se escapó de mi control
Pero todo en este mundo es temporal
En eso no decido yo

Lo hecho está hecho
Volví a tropezar
Con la misma piedra que hubo siempre
Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
Y contigo nunca es suficiente

Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal"

Con la luna en mi nariz
Y como ví que eras sincero
En tus ojos me perdí

Que torpe distracción
Y que dulce sensación

Y ahora que andamos por el mundo
Como Eneas y Benitin
Ya te encontre varios rasguños
Que te hicieron por ahí
Pero mi loco amor
Es tu mejor doctor

Voy a curarte el alma en duelo
Voy a dejarte como nuevo
Y todo va a pasar
Pronto verás el sol brillar
Tú más que nadie mereces ser feliz

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra en el mar

Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
Hasta en tu propio país
Si yo te digo ¿Como dices tu?
Tu aún dices ¿Que decis?
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón

Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado
Conozco la razón que hace doler tu corazón
Por eso quise hacerte esta canción

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar"

Cada vez que se aparece frente a mí tu anatomía
Porque este amor ya no entiende de consejos, ni razones
Se alimenta de pretextos y le faltan pantalones

Este amor no me permite estar en pie
Porque ya hasta me ha quebrado los talones
Aunque me levante volveré a caer
Si te acercas nada es útil para esta inútil

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa más que amarte
Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no sé cómo olvidarte

Cuántas veces he intentado enterrarte en mi memoria
Y aunque diga ""Ya no más"" es otra vez la misma historia
Porque este amor siempre sabe hacerme respirar profundo
Ya me trae por la izquierda y de pelea con el mundo

Si pudiera exorcizarme de tu voz
Si pudiera escaparme de tu nombre
Si pudiera arrancarme el corazón
Y esconderme para no sentirme nuevamente

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa más que amarte
Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no sé cómo olvidarte

Ojerosa, flaca, fea, desgreñada
Torpe, tonta, lenta, necia, desquiciada
Completamente descontrolada
Tú te das cuenta y no me dices nada
Ves que se me ha vuelto la cabeza un nido
Donde solamente tú tienes asilo
Y no me escuchas lo que te digo
Mira bien lo que vas a hacer conmigo

Torpe, traste y testaruda

I feel it deep

'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh-oh

No need to hear my apologies
For being so damn complicated
The ups and downs, the outs and ins
It's what it is

'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh-oh

And even when you won't admit
You know you're gonna need
To be next to the only woman who can make you feel that kind of fire
No, you won't get tired
And when you think it's all I got
I'll bring it up a notch
I'll take you on a crazy ride, you'll never get enough
Baby, I'm your girl
And this is how I show my love

'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

When a woman, when a woman loves

Sigilosa al pasar
Esa loba es especial
Mirala, caminar, caminar

Quién no ha querido a una diosa licántropa
En el ardor de una noche romántica
Mis aullidos son el llamado
Yo quiero un lobo domesticado

Por fin he encontrado un remedio infalible
Que borre del todo la culpa
No pienso quedarme a tu lado mirando la tele
Y oyendo disculpas
La vida me ha dado un hambre voraz
Y tú apenas me das caramelos (Ah)
Me voy con mis piernas y mi juventud por ahí
Aunque te maten los celos

Una loba en el armario
Tiene ganas de salir (Ah-ooh)
Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir

Tengo tacones de aguja magnética
Para dejar la manada frenética
La luna llena como una fruta
No da consejos, ni los escucha

Llevo conmigo un radar especial para localizar solteros
Si acaso me meto en aprietos también
Llevo el número de los bomberos
Ni tipos muy lindos ni divos ni niños ricos yo sé lo que quiero (Ay)
Pasarla muy bien y portarme muy mal
En los brazos de algún caballero

Una loba en el armario
Tiene ganas de salir (Ah-ooh)
Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir

Cuando son casi la una la loba en celo saluda a la luna
Duda si andar por la calle o entrar en un bar a probar fortuna
Ya está sentada en su mesa y pone la mira en su próxima presa
Pobre del desprevenido que no se esperaba una de esas

Sigilosa al pasar
Sigilosa al pasar
Esa loba es especial
Mirala, caminar, caminar

Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir"

Lo que nos pasó no repetirá jamás
Mil años no me alcanzarán para borrarte y olvidar

Y ahora estoy aquí queriendo convertir
Los campos en ciudad, mezclando el cielo con el mar
Sé que te dejé escapar, sé que te perdí
Nada podrá ser igual
Mil años pueden alcanzar (Mil años pueden alcanzar)
Para que puedas perdonar

Estoy aquí queriéndote, ahogándome
Entre fotos y cuadernos, entre cosas y recuerdos
Que no puedo comprender
Estoy enloqueciendome
Cambiándome un pie por la cara mía
Esta noche por el día, ¿y qué?
Nada le puedo yo hacer

Las cartas que escribí, nunca los envié
No querrás saber de mí
No puedo entender la tonta que fui
Es cuestión de tiempo y fe
Mil años con otros mil más (Mil años con otros mil más)
Son suficientes para amar

Estoy aquí queriéndote, ahogándome
Entre fotos y cuadernos, entre cosas y recuerdos
Que no puedo comprender
Estoy enloqueciendome
Cambiándome un pie por la cara mía

Con lo mucho que odio la televisión
Que se vuelvan anticuadas las sonrisas
Y se extingan todas las puestas de sol
Que se supriman las doctrinas y deberes
Que se terminen las peliculas de acción
Que se destruyan en el mundo los placeres
Y que se escriba hoy una última canción

Pero que me quedes tú
Y me quede tu abrazo
Y el beso que inventas cada día
Y que me quede aquí después del ocaso
Para siempre tu melancolía
Por que yo, sí, que dependo de tí
Y si me quedas tú
Me queda la vida

Que desaparezcan todos los vecinos
Y se coman las sobras de mi inocencia
Que se vayan uno a uno los amigos
Y acribillen mi pedazo de conciencia
Que se consuman las palabras en los lábios
Que contaminen todo el agua del planeta
O que renuncien los filántropos y sábios
Y que se muera hoy hasta el último poeta

Pero que me quedes tú
Y me quede tu abrazo
Y el beso que inventas cada día
Y que me quede aquí después del ocaso
Para siempre tu melancolía
Por que yo, yo, sí, sí, que dependo de tí
Y si me quedas tú

Spent the weekends sewing the pieces back on
Crayons and dolls pass me by
Walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly
Not the homecoming kind
Take the top off, and who knows what you might find
Won't confess all my sins
You can bet all trying, but you can't always win

‘Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements just like a gypsy
And I won't back down ‘cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me
‘Cause I'm a gypsy

‘Cause I'm a gypsy

I can't hide what I've done
Scars remind me of just how far that I've come
To whom it may concern
Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt

‘Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
I don't make agreements, just like a gypsy
And I won't back down ‘cause life's already bit me

Debe ser el perfume que usas
O el agua con la que te bañas
Pero cada cosita que haces
A mí me parece una hazaña
Me besaste esa noche
Cual si fuera el último día de tu boca
Cada vez que yo me acuerdo
Yo siento en mi pecho el peso de una roca

Son tus ojos marrones
Esa veta verdosa
Es tu cara de niño
Y esa risa nerviosa

I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer
I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer

Por el puro placer de flotar
Ahora si me llevó la corriente
Ya no puedo dormir ni comer
Como lo hace la gente decente
Un recuerdo ha quedado
Así como un broche prendido en mi almohada
Y tú en cambio que tienes memoria de pez
No te acuerdas de nada

Son tus manos de hombre
El olor de tu espalda
Lo que no tiene nombre
Lo logró tu mirada

I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer
I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer"

And my agnosticism turned into dust

How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no ohh
Oh-oh-oh and as long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways
There were nights that I stayed up crying
Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh-oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh-oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

Y de sus propios instintos
No escaparon con suerte
Con el fuego por dentro
Y las hormonas presentes
Por la ley del magneto
Se acercaron los cuerpos

Pero el susto se dio unas semanas después
Cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
Un niño nacería y ya sabías la fecha

Y antes de que el vecino y la familia supieran
Fuiste donde el doctor a acabar con el problema
Hoy tu vecino esta en casa dándose un buen duchazo
Y tu 2 metros bajo tierra viendo crecer gusanos

Desde ese entonces hay quienes lo han visto
Solo en las calles transitar
Anda esperando paciente por alguien
Con quien al menos tranquilo pueda conversar

Mientras tanto, este mundo gira y gira
Sin poderlo detener
Y aquí abajo unos cuantos nos manejan
Como fichas de ajedréz
No soy la clase de idiota que se deja convencer
Pero digo la verdad
Y hasta un ciego lo puede ver

Si a falta de ocupación o de excesiva soledad
Dios no resistiera más y se marchara a otro lugar
Sería nuestra perdición
No habría otro remedio más
Que adorar a Michael Jackson, a Bill Clinton o a Tarzán
Es más dificil ser rey sin corona
Que una persona más normal
Pobre de Dios, que no sale en revistas
Que no es modelo, ni artista o de familia real

Mientras tanto, este mundo gira y gira
Sin poderlo detener
Y aquí abajo unos cuantos nos manejan
Como fichas de ajedréz
No soy la clase de idiota que se deja convencer
Pero digo la verdad
Y hasta un ciego lo puede ver

Mientras tanto, este mundo gira y gira
Sin poderlo detener
Y aquí abajo unos cuantos nos manejan
Como fichas de ajedréz
No soy la clase de idiota que se deja convencer
Pero digo la verdad

Pop,Shakira,2014,Shakira.,You Don’t Care About Me,"I fold your t-shirts
And I strip your bed
I loved you perfect
But there's no, appreciation
I listen sweetly to your sour tongue
I loved you only
But there's no, reciprocation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left in my heart, in my soul
Should have never helped you become
So powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did you would let me go
You will eventually
Cause you just don't care about me
You don't care if I die
If you did you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me

You say you're thirsty so I pour the wine
The bottle's empty
But there's no, consummation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left in my heart, in my soul
Should have never helped you become
So powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did you would let me go
You will eventually
Cause you just don't care about me
You don't care if I die
If you did you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me

Oh baby how we used to dance
I couldn't separate from your hands
Now they don't even play that song anymore

You don't care about me (No)
Don't care about me (No)
Don't care about me
You don't care about me (No)
Don't care about me (No)
You don't care about me

Cause you just don't care about me
You don't care if I die

Ayo ma, how you doin'? It's your son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of every time I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me?
Knowin' that everything that you said would never fail me
Like they got plans for ya, ain't nothin' I can do
When them laws get they hands on you, but I ain't listenin'
Even payin' attention, I'm just tryna get mine
Takin' advantage, you workin' two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin' about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both your cars, stole money from your drawers
Sold dope out your yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want

You hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin' me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason girl you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me
Livin' at your granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money? My boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to

Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now.. please rise for the singing of our national anthem

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god livin; like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand, baby, what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today?
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed

See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles
Hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri

Mur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'm a sixteen-year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
Money, money, money, money what's happenin'
I'm comin' up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with, you know how we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do

DID YOU HEAR THAT ELIZABETH? HERE COME THE BIG ONE!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a General Custard
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Super Bowl with Julius Peppers
I got that can't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they can't stop, won't stop, screamin the name
NELLY! NELLY! Go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'mma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win
Up, or down ten, I'mma fight to the end

Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin
I'mma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a..) in me

I'm the first pick, the first round, signing bonus profound
Playin for his hometown, reppin for the home ground
And gettin Bucks like Michael Redd, tell 'em again
I gets Bucks like Michael Redd, heard what I said?
The MVP of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shootin out from my reign, with Peyton Manning-type aim
Can't stop me from scorin so they results are just hackin
So there's, three of us now - me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been Raven about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin or if I'm sittin and readin
Waitin for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a pick, man
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW


It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin
I've been dogfightin, scratchin and clawin on every hike
Tryin to make you remember me like you Remember the Titans
Cause I'm a WARR-IOR, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young, black, and rich
As good as it gets, and givin your point guard fits
He think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh...

Switching up your hair, got your freaky dress on
Said that you were fresh, like you were 'bout to perform
And I’ma fucking mess I had you on my own
Wake up - you was gone, I can’t even blame you
Now you in the arms of a stranger
And now I’m all alone with this anger
You used to feel safe now I’m danger
So when you had to leave without a warning
Such a whirlwind, I want my girlfriend
Got me on ten, I can’t even pretend
You used to love me, but now you ain't here

And I hope you’re happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I no longer want it
I guess, I walk away

I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanting
All the things that you wanting
But the presence I’m holding
I guess I walk away

Girl you got me all this stressing and this manic depressing
I’m switching up how I'm feeling and listening to suggestions
Hey your expression is new, thought you knows all up in her IQ
And I could write a book on how to
Ruin a good thing, living without you
Thought I paid for my wrongs ‘cause I ain’t have enough
Told me I’m living, I had to call you bluff
Now I’m calling your phone, but you ain’t picking up
I should have gave you love, I should have gave you trust
And now you moved on, and you’re forgetting us
I’m singing this sad song, but you don’t give a fuck


There’s nothing that hurts more than heartbreak
No one wants to take that fault
You’re thinking about her all day
Nothing else matters at all
And the only thing worse than her living
Is knowing it’s your fault
And now I’m going through hard times"

Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me

Now I see you're lookin' at my body, babe
And now you wanna come and put it on me
If I gave it to you could you promise me
That you could make it feel like it never did
Cause I see you (I see you) and you see me (You see me)
Now if I please you (I please you) could you please me
(You please me)
Now I ain't the one in no relationship
And I ain't tryna be the other chick
I know you want it

The way that you're walkin, the way that you're talkin' - talkin
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin' - the morning
(Ah) I can already tell you want it
Cause you're shakin' it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me"

You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick

So basically I'm a joke right?
Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When I use that, shoes untied before you know it, method:
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's gettin' hectic, wreck it just like a hooptie with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles twistin' and pullin'
I'm like shorty help me (come on)
Help me (please) don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile...
So I take advantage
Kisses in gentle places tryin' to get myself established
I'm comfortable, wanna be in that moe with no control
Concentrating on my every lick her every blow
Yep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below
And how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know
IT'S ON, put my penis in accurate, just relax a bit
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-set

Now I comes first like the front porch, in a Polo Sport shirt
Skirts, there they are, gots to flirt cause I'm far
From Average Lame with that ""What's your name?"" game
I'm stormin' on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if you can, watch me wrap like Saran
All up in these sheets, now you on me like a tan
Leavin me like a van in reverse, that's the worse
Playa curse put up on me now, we spreadin' on my homies
Like a germ, watch me turn into captain kill a ho
Fill a ho strong watch me last long like a penny broke
Many motels I got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on futons, comin' out like Keyuan
I'm ill like ceramic in a hammock, goddamit
That's my words, ooh's and aah's slurred like a verb
Showin' action like an ass like a metaphor

I spit mo' shit off into they ears than dialtones and telephones
Just to get their ass back home
Come watch the Bed-rock like Flintstones
But son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa (y'know)
Drive me nuts like Planters, hawkin' a nigga like offalana (swish)
I ban ya from the smoke house, trick, who you think you fuckin with?
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show (grab hold) then I let go
(Flows) split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat, to hit any one of you niggas rattin'
Spit some game and get a bird, come watch us tag team like free bird
Say the word, I be at rest with all my partners
Straight loungin' with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin'
Go make the announcement, spark more Dynamite than ""Good Times""
Want both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs
Take pride in my stabbin', headboards you be grabbin'
Got 'em bangin' the walls so hard the neighbors callin'

Asking you, ""What happened? What's goin' on over there even?
Sounds like you guys are goin' crazy""

Pop,Nelly,2008,Brass Knuckles,Stepped On My J’z,"Uhh... (ooooooh)
Uhh, ha ha (uh, uh, listen)
Y'all know what this is! (let's go)

We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall (mall)
Just so we could be the first ones with 'em on (c'mon)
Returned to school by lunchtime like, ""Nigga, what now?""
And today we in the club like, ""Nigga, what now?""
You better look down 'cause uhh, I know you see 'em (say what?)
I know you see 'em (say what?) I know you see 'em
I paid a thousand for the jeans, I paid 200 for the shoes
And uhh, fuck a shirt, I'mma rock these tattoos (and uh)
You see my fitted man, I represent the crib
'Cause even at the crib, I represent the crib
I, might pop my grill in - and I, might let my chain hang
And I, might wrap my wrist dang (go on, derrty, do the damn thang)
I get 'em free (say what) but I pay
And if I want I rock a different year of J's every day (uhh)
A different style, different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
These just came out! He done stepped on my J's (uhh)
Hell naw, ain't no way (what's wrong?)
Man, he done stepped on my J's (what?)
Stepped on my J's, he done stepped on my J's
I can't believe this shit! He done stepped on my J's

Uhh, I-I-I got 'em all (got 'em all) but they don't get no run
Like them 13's, 7's, number fo' and the 1's
I like, how they look with Dickies, how do Levi lay on 'em?
If you ain't got 'em when you see me you definitely gon' want 'em
If they knew I gotta get 'em first, old as a copper box
Hook 'em with a shirt, and the matchin' color socks
I think the coldest was the black on black 11's with the red bottom
Or the number 9's, you shoulda seen me when I got 'em
I was in my house (in my house) dancin' in the mirror
Straight thinkin' 'bout gettin out and how I'm 'bout to kill 'em
When you know you got a pair that ain't nobody got (body got)
You can't hold 'em back, homie, you gotta rock (you gotta rock)
I'm a addict, a Jordan fanatic, little Mars Blackmon
I know when they comin'; number, color, everything that's happenin'
You know, a different style, a different color is a must
But uhh, it's all good until I get my first scuff and I'm like

I-I-I, I see you lil' daddy you look sexy with them J's on
I pull up in the drop, and step out, with them things on
I got me the black and pink - patent leather with the grey
Matchin' with the skinny jeans - off with the shades
I know you see me (I know you see me) my jeans be never slippin' (slippin')
The paparazzi, I might stop and take a picture in 'em
Yeahhhhh, we be fresh every day
And if you lookin' for me lil' daddy you can find me in the A! A! A! A!

I got the Retro 1's, uhh
(Then I bought the) 2's (and the) 3's (and the) 4's (uhh)
I had to order these, you can't find them in the store (nope)
Called up my stylist like, ""Shorty, send more""
And if you would please send 'em to me out on tour
(Uh-uh, uh-uh) They be here in a minute, man
See, I got that connect where I can damn near get like anythang
Plus all my hoes on 'em, then I'mma stroll on 'em
I call my hook-up at the store like ""Put a hold on 'em""
Them Carolina number 9's matchin' patent leather wristbands
Patent leather number 11's, we call 'em Space Jams
You in my space man, I'mma make you jump man
I'll make you jump, the jump, the jump, jump man
See on my weekends, my J's play a part
I'm rockin' these to the club and these to the park
I'm puttin' these on now and these here tomorrow
A spare off in my car, just in case I catch a scar

Pop,Nelly,2002,Nellyville,Nellyville,"Welcome to Nellyville, where all newborns get a half-a-mill'
Sons, get sedan DeVilles, soon as they can reach the wheel
And daughters, get diamonds the size of their age - I'm talkin'
One year get one carat, two years get two carats
Three years get three carats, and so on into marriage
Nobody livin average, everybody jang-a-lang
Nobody livin savage, e'rybody got change
Even the paperboy deliver out the back of a Range
It's not a game, it's a beautiful thang
Imagine blocks and blocks of no cocaine, blocks with no gunplay
Ain't nobody shot, so ain't no news that day
Ain't nobody snitchin, they refuse to say
Every month - we take a vote on what the weather should be
And if we vote it rains - know how wet we want it to be
And if we vote it snow - know how deep we want it to get
But the sun gon' shine 99 percent, in Nellyville

There's no.. way.. I.. I could explaiiiiin..
The way I feel right now
There's no.. way.. I.. I could explaiiiiin..
The way I feel about livin in Nellyville

I got that good at e'ry gas station, pull on up
Give me a half a ounce of that shit, fill it up
We got straws for the bottles, outlaw the cups
And we gon' make it happen, ain't no need for no luck
Ain't no lotteries, no pick 3's or pick 2's
Keep the money in your family, gamble amongst your crew
Cause the dice gon' do what the dice gon' do
And if you take a life, you gon' lose yours too
Ain't no trials, it's automatic, you drop 'em right where it happen
You do unto others if you don't want it don't do the cappin
Think that's cool? 40 acres and a mule
Fuck that! Nellyville - 40 acres and a pool
Six bedrooms, full bath with a jacuzz'
Six-car garage, pavement smooth
Both front and back deck 'nough room to land a jet
And you ain't reached the city, that's just the projects

 Everybody, uh, now everybody say

Well I want to go, please let me go
I need to go - down to Nellyville
I need to see, what I can see
Won't you and me - go to Nellyville
I want to go, so bad
I just want to go and look
Won't you please take me on in
I just know I gotta be there

No unexpectancy, like teenage pregnancy
And physical mental attraction your only ecstasy
Your own destiny, create your own recipe
If you ain't livin accordin to dirty then you stressin me
""And who are you?"" Who me? I'm the mayor
And any problems you got, I live up thurr
""Where's that?"" The house on the hill, welcome mat of fur
When you pass by that thang, be polite and don't sturr


Yeah
There's no.. way.. yeah
There's no.. way.. yeah
There's no.. way.. yeah

Pop,Nelly,2000,Country Grammar,Wrap Sumden,"Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh

You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y

You see Biggie be like, ""What's Beef?""
Me I'm like what's weed?
Weed is actually a medicine for me, you know
Every 4 hours, like a prescription I'm smoking
And I'm thanking my reefer chief for making me choke
I'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love
Then after that roll cool ""J's"" I mean bud
'Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds
I spit residue smoke on my way to buy weed
Wrap Sumden, always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong
My best friend's a bong and my homies is smokers only
I know one day, I'm gone stop
But that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick
But on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget
Shit, I'm still stuck at point ""A"" ya dig
And my momma think that I should quit

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh

Yeah, I get high, you might see me stroll by
In the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye
I'm sick now, I think I'm catching glaucoma
Standing on the corner, looking for weed donors
You know how we do it kid. We get that good herb and swerve
Till the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd
That's my word, Wrap Sumden (Wrap Sumden)
Make a nigga clap something, get all mad and slap something
Yo, grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors
See I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers
Say dutch time, roll up it's clutch time
And I burn mine, don't you ever, ever touch mine
Fire it up, dog, but watch out for 5-0
Eyes low from plenty Henny and hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich
Go platinum and do some shows, and get blowed

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y

All I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo
If I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more
But since I don't some might consider me slow
Don't worry though
I keep the pants sag, bubble eye hands rag
Eyes glassed smoking fill from the hash
Choking after that but don't the blunt pass
""What we doin' today?"" Same shit we did last week
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up
Bag up and make some runs and roll up
5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up
Okay, made a left so continue to roll up
Don't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them
But guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y

Pop,T-Pain,2014,Stoicville: The Phoenix,Stoicville,"Whoever thought a young'un' from a city full of rattlesnakes
Was ever gon' make it out the grass patch
Seven heels had me looking for a better deal
A hood nigga; I couldn't count on the NASDAQ
Coming home from school, I had tears in my eyes
They was picking on me and wouldn't give me my hat back
Now, I got enough hats to give away
It's better days, I refuse to have flashbacks
Nobody thought I knew what I was doing
Nobody believed, so nobody would walk me through it
But nobody achieved what I achieved
If only somebody could have just seen what I seen
Said they praying for me, don't we all got needs?
'Til I walk in the room, and they all just freeze
And they all look relieved, like, ""Shit
If Faheem made it, now, we all got cheese""
Nah, homie, that ain't the way it work
Especially if you ain't even put in a day of work
Now, they going crazy 'cause I made it first
See, homie, I just made it work
It's a cold world, ask my old girl
She feel my pain, and I ain't even tryin' to make it hurt
And my daddy proud of me
But he got too much pride to say it out loud for me
Got that keyboard off the road, brought in the house for me
He coming to my shows, hanging in the crowd for me
Man, I still love my niggas
The only thing that I ask is that they hold it down for me
I still rep the 850, yeah
I got it tatted on my arm, it ain't goin' nowhere
But motherfuckers will say that you changed
And they the ones that wouldn't last a day in this game
Don't get me wrong, I ain't saying I stayed the same
But I guarantee that I will never succumb to the fame
That's some bullshit, and y'all know that ain't me
But I'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
Life goes on and hopefully only great things
Traveling the world and seeing shit that I ain't seen
Then, one day, I look at my reflection
And realize how I been actin' and how I been dressing
I realize I can make an impression
But good Lord, this is fuckin' depressin'
And good Lord, I got some fuckin' questions
I think it's time for some motherfucking confessions
Wake up call, wake up call
My answer to every question was ""Fuck y'all""
All I need is this 9-11 to fuck broads
I just need to find a seven with enough flaws
My last album ain't do numbers like I wanted to
But that was God tryna ask me what I'm gonna do
He said ""I hate to put obstacles right in front of you
But you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through""
Hurdles got jumped, mountains got climbed
Til' Molly came and put a fuckin' wall up in my mind
Now I'm in the crib trippin', complainin' and bitchin'
That liqour go to hittin', I'm in here reminiscing
How many niggas told me I was gonna fail?
'Cause I got a list of niggas that can go to Hell
They feel like I owe 'em something 'cause they know me well
Calling me a sellout cause I won't come back and smoke a L
The same nigga that told me I had a hit
Charged me $300 to put it up in his mix
Now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
'Cause the whole time they knew that I was livin' out my whip
But now I see 'em, and I can't even take iit
Cause he walk up to me and say:
""Boy, I knew you was gon' make it""
And like, ""Motherfucker, do you not just recall?
I needed help, and you just left me sittin' on my balls""
That just wasn't the right life
So I told him bullshit, to have a nice life
And all them girls yellin' at me from in front of the moon
Like nigga, how you just gonna go and get a white wife?
Fuck you bitches, I did what I did
Now, I'm running round my mansion doing shit with my kids
But now, maybe my life is too sweet
Like I woke up in that Bugatti and went right back to sleep
Deep, I was dreaming, y'all niggas was scheming
Like crabs up in the bucket, but y'all just got defeated
And all these bitches, all just want my semen
The star collecting checks and ball up in the season
But ain't nobody give a fuck when ain't nobody give a fuck
Now, they got they hand out, asking me to give it up
And every time they ask me for something
They say, ""Now, you know that I ain't never asked you for nothin'""
I got loss, I got loss
Credit cards got swiped, money got tossed
Hundred after hundred, dollar after dollar
Drinking every kind of liquor, then that Molly got swallowed
I know I fucked up 'cause I'm a grown man
So now, I'm thinking like my old man
He said ""You wanna make God laugh?
Then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan""
Now, I see my niggas just want me to win
But I won't have 'em if I keep disrespecting my friends
They been through it, say they know the feel
So all I need is a trip up to Stoicville"

Go ‘head, turn around so I can smack you on the ass with it
Look good, smell good, sweeter than a candy

So much money you could probably feed all of your family
When you’re finished maybe we could get a little nasty
If you think your shorty drop-dead gorgeous
Better know my shorty drop-bread gorgeous
Small waist, ass bigger than a walrus

Get my top and socks off by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we don't buy bottles, we bring 'em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave 'em
And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy

Pop,Kesha,2017,Rainbow,Old Flames (Can’t Hold a Candle to You),"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who
I used to take comfort from long before I met you
I caught a spark in his eyes of forgotten desire
With a word, or a touch, I could've rekindled that fire

But old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Oh, yeah, ooh

But sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known
And I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
(feel so alone)
Then I feel you beside me, and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night, lost in the sweet light of dawn

Oh, but old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickerin' embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you

Pop,Kesha,2017,Rainbow,Emotional,"God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional

It started in November, I started losing my mind
I ended up in rehab, I don't want to cry
But people can be so mean, and I don't understand why
And when they say I can't sing, I just want to die

Trying to keep my shit together
When will this get any better?
I'm trying so hard not to break down

God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional

I didn't mean to do this, didn't mean to sell out
Got everything I ever thought I wanted, now I can't get out
I saw the love of my life leave me for his new wife
Stab me right in the heart with a fucking knife

Trying to keep my shit together
When will this get any better?
I'm trying so hard not to break down

God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional

I'm driving back home through the canyon
There's only so much that I can handle
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
I never show it, I never show it
I'm supposed to be the girl that never does this
I'm supposed to be some party girl that stands for nothing
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
I'm about to lose it, I'm about to lose it

Pop,Kesha,2020,High Road,Cowboy Blues,"Sing it with me, you shithead

They say you know when you know, ooh
What do you do when you don't?
They say in love, it'll happen if it's meant to happen
But what do you do if it don't?

Do you ever lie in bed with your three cats
And get obsessed with some boy you met
One time, three years ago in Nashville?
And you can't remember his last name
And think

Did I fuck my whole life up?
Did I miss my one true love?
Was he right in front of me at the dive bar?
Was that you with the cowboy blues?
You ask me, ""Babe, take a chance, come on, just stay""
Why'd I leave you standing there at the dive bar?
I miss you with the cowboy blue suit

Sha-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, ooh

My therapist said, ""Listen, girl, it's a love addiction""
She gave me a book on that (Did you read it? No)
My tarot cards read there's a dead man clinging to my aura
And to let go of the past

I can't help that I'm in bed with my three cats
I'm still obsessed with some boy
I shot whiskey with for one night
And I don't remember if he remembers me
While I sit here thinking about him

Did I fuck my whole life up?
Did I miss my one true love?
Was he right in front of me at the dive bar?
Was that you with the cowboy blues?
You ask me, ""Babe, take a chance, come on, just stay""
Why'd I leave you standing there at the dive bar?

I miss you with the cowboy blue suit
Sha-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, ooh
I miss you with the cowboy blue

Some days, it's easy, some days, it's hard
Sunday's the night that we met at the bar
Laughing and dancing and shooting the shit
What would've happened if I'd had your kids?

Did I fuck my whole life up?
Did I miss my one true love?
Was he right in front of me at the dive bar?
Was that you with the cowboy blues?
You ask me, ""Babe, take a chance, come on, just stay""
Why'd I leave you standing there at the dive bar?
I miss you in the cowboy blue nudie suit"

All the psycho voices always yelling at me in my head

I'm over the drama
I'm moving to a distant island
Where I'll sleep all day
If I want to

I'll grow some potatoes and flowers
Then I'll make sandcastles, then I'll eat some cake
'Cause I want to
La-di-da-di-da
'Cause I want to

Living in this world's like watching one big infomercial
There's useless information clogging up my little brain
I used to think my Gucci bag meant my shit was together
But now I see growing up's a game that I don't wanna play
No, no

I'm over adulthood
I'm throwing all my big girl panties
In the garbage can
'Cause I can

I'll be out riding my pony until it's time for candy
And I'll be naked because I want to

'Cause I want to

Anything in the world that you wanted to?
What makes you happy? Do what you wanna do

Even if you cannot hear my voice

Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives

Why you can't raise your voice to say

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Slower slower

All I want's to find an easy way
To get out of our little heads
Have heart, my dear

Making up for all this mess

The first winter of my life

The first dance
Well, the first one that counted
Felt like my blood was built from crackling lights

All this ancient wildness
That we don't understand
The first sound of a heartbeat
To riots roaring on

This is not the love you've've had before
This is something else
This is something else
This is not the same as other days
This is something else
This is something else
It shouldn't need to be so fucking hard
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It doesn't need to be the end of you, or me
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth

The first light
First light on the silent shore
Just the ships that anchor me and you
The way home
This is always the way home
So you can rip that map to shreds, my dear

But all we ever wanted
Seemed miles and miles from here
And the first days in a strange new land
Awaken beasts in us

This is not the love you've've had before
This is something else
This is something else
This is not the same as other days

Are played in loops 'till it's madness in my head
Is it too late to remind you how we were?
But not our last days of silence, screaming, blurred
Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door
You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far
Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
Do the things that you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
More than anything I want to see you, girl
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world"

Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories
Well, we do not need to be told

Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

I was called out in the dark
By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets

Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

Healed in the blinking of an eye

And then when the dawn cracked over us

We could ride the morning into night again
We knew the days were there to waste

But these days
That light hit so heavy
And those days
Feel like another life

This isn't like the first time anymore
And I've been chasing that too long
Digging for the lost memories
Of a youth written in fire
You've always said it's not too late for me
Well I sure am listening to you now
Believe in me so I can trust myself
'Cause there's a first time for that too

Remember the first time that we kissed - It felt like a planet forming
Though we were just novices at this - It felt like an ancient wisdom
There was lightning then and those songs were all proved true
No wonder I still think so much about you

But these days
My heart feels too heavy
And those days
Are someone else's life

It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch
Cold water, cleaning my wounds
A side parade, with a single balloon
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
Blue as seas, running to them
I feel like I am watching everything from space
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want"
Pop,Snow Patrol,2008,A Hundred Million Suns,Set Down Your Glass,"Just close your eyes
And count to five
Let's craft the only thing we know into surprise
Set down your glass
I painted this
To look like you and me forever as we're now
And I'm shaken then I'm still
When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills
Like to tell you all I want is now
You sing and I'm killed
I'm just not the same
As I was a year ago and each minute since then
My jumper tears
As we take it off
And you say you'll sew me good as new and I know you will
And I'm shaken then I'm still
When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills
Like to tell you all I want is now"
Pop,Snow Patrol,2018,Wildness,What If This Is All the Love You Ever Get? (Alternate Version),"Woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah, you'd do a couple things so differently, I bet
Woah, what if this is all the love I ever know
Woah, I'd say the words that were so hard to say: don't go

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart

What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here

Woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah, you'd not worry so much about counting your regrets
Woah, what if this is all the love I'm ever shown
Woah, I'd not be so scared to run into the unknown

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart

What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here
What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get?"
Pop,Snow Patrol,2004,Final Straw,Grazed Knees,"I'm trying not to stare, it's too late
The blanket's over there, if you like
I'm broken and I'm colder than hell
I should've said I'd not come back here
Your breakfast will get cold
I really have to go
It's easier to lie and be safe
Time and time again I'm half stalled
One giant leap of faith is easy
When everyone you ask is so sure
Just give a second thought
What if we don't get caught
Just say you love me now
And forget this whole row
Just save your energy
For making up with me"
Pop,Snow Patrol,2006,Eyes Open,Headlights On Dark Roads,"For once I want to be the car crash
Not always just the traffic jam
Hit me hard enough to wake me
And lead me wild to your dark roads
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear
My tongue is lost so I can't tell you
Please just see it in my eyes
I pull up thorns from our ripped bodies
And let the blood fall in my mouth
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear

Pop,Snow Patrol,2003,Final Straw,Ways & Means,"Getting too busy to make amends
I should try to make it right
Are you ready for the shit to hit?
I think you say you are, but aren't
Doctor, make it better instantly
And you're the only one who can
I've been waiting here my whole damn life
And I've forgotten what I wanted

Maybe I can do it if I put my back into it
I can leave here if I wanted
But there's nowhere else that I can go
Maybe I won't suffer if I find a way to love her
I'd be lying to myself
But there is no way out that I can see

If I lied you'd know it instantly
So I just had to look away
All the honesty I've ever lost
I can't begin to even curse
I never knew the taste of blood 'til now
It's clear I never should've known
Breathing fire was never this much fun
So there's a dark side in us all

Maybe I can do it if I put my back into it
I can leave here if I wanted
But there's nowhere else I can go
Maybe I won't suffer, if I find a way to love her
I'd be lying to myself
But there is no way out that I can see"
Pop,Snow Patrol,2008,A Hundred Million Suns,Lifeboats,"Hold on hold on, let me get the words out before I burst
There's no truth at all poking at the giant eyes of ancient gods
Cool heads have failed now it's time for me to have my turn
Kiss me kiss me, life is way too short to scream and shout
Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streams
Stretching out like vast cracked ice
The veins of you the veins of me like great forest trees
Pushing through and on and in
Gliding like a satellite in the broken night
And when I wake you're there I'm saved
Your love is life piled tight and high set against the sky
That seems to balance on its own
Sing out sing out, the silence only eats us from the inside up
I meant no harm but I only get to say these words too late
Wake up wake up, dreaming only leads to more and more nightmares
Snap out of it you said it in a way that showed you really cared
Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streams
Stretching out like vast cracked ice
The veins of you the veins of me like great forest trees
Pushing through and on and in
Gliding like a satellite in the broken night
And when I wake you're there I'm saved
Your love is life piled tight and high set against the sky
That seems to balance on its own
Send your lifeboats out for me
Send your lifeboat out"
Pop,Daniel Powter,2005,Daniel Powter,Bad Day,"Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day

You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride

Come on

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

Cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (yeah that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)

Never once you looked at me

Run free to a place no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed
Excited over you?
I've closed my eyes and thought of us
A hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times
I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like, if you like I'll go
Down, down, down, down, da, down, down

Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I’m wishing, thinking, dreaming
Bout you, and the love
How’d I ever let you get away

Joni Mitchell never lies
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone

If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games
Got until it's gone
Got until it's gone
Joni Mitchel never lies

Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s

That you don’t know what you’ve got til...

One two, one two, yo
Let me just fuck with it for a minute, what
(that you don't what you've got til it's gone)
Now you realizing when them nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I’m gone, right
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was working round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide but my love you impeach
Now you looking at the walls, head in hands, cold jonezin
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing

And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that

Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Joni Mitchell never lies
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone

In fact is was a third Monday
You came along to be the one for me
And now I'm alone
I'm sittin' here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I have

Do believe cause you know you cannot win

Spent most your life pretending not to be
The one you are but who you choose to see
Learned to survive in your fictitious world
Does what they think of you determine your worth?
If special's what you feel when you're with them
Taken away you feel 'less than' again

No you cannot change it right away
Gotta make a try
And with time it'll start to go away
I'll be here when you need
That one to sit and cry to
Cause I'm the you you forgot
The only one you know you cannot lie to

Bitter you'll be if you don't change your ways
When you hate you you hate everyone that day
Unleash this scared child that you've grown into
You cannot run for you can't hide from you
Can't hide from you

Won't need no compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday

Pop,Janet Jackson,2015,Unbreakable,The Great Forever,"Not too pleased with what you're diggin'
I'm just busy livin' my life
""Sources say,"" but where ya gettin' it?
Don't create the truth you like

It might sound strange to you
But what you think it don't mean nothing at all
Doesn't change who I am
Doesn't change who I love

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth

If you wrong would you admit it?
And take the heat up under the lights
Use your expert criticism
Then maybe you could get a life
Don't like seeing people happy
Is it jealousy or personal?
Cause I don't see why loving someone
Or what I do seem so radical to you

Still it might sound strange to you
But what you think it don't mean nothing at all
Doesn't change who I am
Doesn't change who I love

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth

Once you know why you're here
It becomes crystal clear
To love someone is divine
That empty hole in your heart
It will tear you apart
Because hate will only divide
(Bless you)

Hey hey hey hey
Nah nah nah nah nah
Hey
Nah nah
It's sad when you take such a beautiful thing
Blow it up and call it the news
It's not ok still I hope that one day
You'll find the great forever too
(L.U.T.F.A.)

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going

And harmonized while we all did our part
Danced and sang our way through most anything
Always felt safe in each others' love

The fall and winter never felt so cold
And Lord knows words can never express it
Life feels so empty I miss you much
Painful tears like never before
We can't laugh together till we cry
But our love's ain't no material thing

Stronger
Broken hearts last
Longer

Free to imagine the future you like
Soaring above all of your boundaries
Yes the day will come
Just remember when you're overwhelmed
Dream and take some time to love yourself
Believe you're free to do whatever you want
No no more room number four
You never know
Unless you've been there
I'm singing this love song to show my support
To the beautiful people who have been ignored
With blind eyes and cold shoulders attacking them
Invisible people they won't let fit in
Let's open our eyes to the true barriers
Stereotypical things are the worst
Stand face to face with the real ugly truth
How would you feel if that was you?
Because every life matters
(We all need to do better)
So we all should try
(We all need to do better)
A smile
A kind word
Or extending a hand
Helping someone to feel human again
If we never start
It could be you on the other end
You never know

Pop,Janet Jackson,1989,Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814,Lonely,"Todos necesitamos
Un amigo en la soledad

Feeling so alone and deserted
With people standing all around you
Should I trust someone?
Should I stay off to myself?
Alone with no one to talk to
It's such a helpless feeling, so

Anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
'Cause everybody needs a friend
To be there when you're lonely

So don't isolate yourself
Every time that I come around
A person all alone is an unhappy one
We need somebody near to love us
Someone who cares
Living life all by yourselves
Impossible to do
And I'll be there for you

Anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
'Cause everybody needs a friend
And I'll be yours if you're lonely

If you're all alone and a friend, you need
Like a river flows, you hurt, I'll bleed
If you trust in me, we can find a way
Take away the pain, time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind
'Cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find
If you're lonely, I will be there
When you call for me, be there for you

So anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Everybody needs a friend
To be there when you lonely

Don't be shy call on me
When you need a friend, you can call on me
Never let you down, never let you down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Be there always through the night
If you're all alone and a friend, you need
Be there for you, be there for you, oh baby
If you're all alone and a friend, you need
Like a river flows, you hurt, I'll bleed
If you trust in me, we can find a way
Take away the pain, time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind
'Cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find
Una persona solitaria es una persona muy triste
Te quiero tanto"

Pop,Céline Dion,2017,Beauty and the Beast: 2017 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),How Does a Moment Last Forever,"How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

Maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We’ll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on

How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres
And makes us whole

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

How does a moment last forever
When our song lives on"

For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I would be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark, shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies, you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (When I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach

Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back to me

And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago

It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind

All coming back to me

All coming back to me

If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget

From this fear I will break free
And I'll live again with love

I never thought that love would come back to me
When I closed my eyes and tried to dream
Darkness was the only thing I could see

I had run out of hope
Reached the end of the road
Hit the rocks at the bottom with no farther to go
But just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

I can’t believe I'm falling in love once again
I can't believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love once again

When you take my hand you hold my heart
And I know everything will be alright
When you touch me there I feel it everywhere
I'm loving things I never thought I would like

I can't believe I'm falling in love once again
I can’t believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can’t believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love

I been chasing,  chasing
Chasing all these highs so I could crash the ceiling
I been restless, tempted to follow every devil way down
I took it so low and at the time, it looked like no way out

I had to see
Try to believe
I write my story and this ain't how it's ending
Said to myself, said to myself
""This ain't how I'm gonna go down""

To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home you gotta go
The hard way, hard way

Turnin', turnin', turnin'
Turnin' every corner 'cause my heart was yearning
For something more than 4 AM
Messed up in bed, no, I don't miss that feeling
I don't see a reason
Chasing love down a dead end
But see the truth is
I wouldn't know that unless I did

Pop,R. Kelly,2005,TP.3: Reloaded,Trapped in the Closet Chapter 1,"Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretching and yawning
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darling"" from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face like what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here 'til the morning sun?
Must have lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, ""Woman, move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs
""Shh, shh, quiet, hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound, or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the fifth floor""
""Shit, think, shit, think, shit, quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
And he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says ""Honey I'm in the room""
He walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him and says ""I've cooked and ran your bathwater""
I'm telling you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed and starts to snatching her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it, but things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, ""There’s a mystery going on
And I'm going to solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet""
He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch, say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed (bed)
Then under the dresser (dresser)
He looks at the closet (closet)
I pull out my Beretta (Beretta)
He walks up to the closet (closet)
Get closer to the closet (closet)
Now he's at the closet (closet)

Pop,R. Kelly,2005,Trapped in the Closet: Chapters 1-12,Trapped in the Closet Chapter 6,"Believe it or not
I just started laughin'
Shaking my head
And just kept on laughin'
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then she cries, ""What? Why do you have that smile upon your face?""
Then I laughed out said, ""Thinking about the things that I've been through""
She wipes her nose and she sniggles and laughs out, ""I've been through it too""
Then I start laughing again
And she start laughing more
Then next thing you know we both are
Cracking up on the floor
And she laughs out, ""I can't believe this idiot really answered my phone""
Now meanwhile 'Twan just got out of prison and he's on his way home
Then she laughs, ""Baby I'm sorry for all the lies and all the bullshit""
Then I say girl, ""Just wait till I tell you all the drama that I've been dealing wit'""
She laughs, ""I wanna hear it all""
Then I laugh and say, ""Baby first of all
I got a hangover, been trapped in the closet, slept wit who knows, threatened to kill a pastor""
She says, ""What?""
""Baby this is no lie, he had a lover, turns out to be a gay guy""
She says, ""Damn you've been through a lot of shit""
""Plus I got a ticket""
Meanwhile the policeman he turns around
Just out of concern comes back to the house
Then he pulls up in the driveway
My car's parked crooked with the lights on
Then he goes around the back way
He hear the dogs barking like something's wrong
He gets to the backdoor and discover it's been broken in
He looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in
Meanwhile we're laughing and laughing and laughing
But from his perspective he thinks somebody's crying
He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear that somebody was coughing and sighing
Meanwhile we're in the bedroom laughing as I'm trying to continue to explain
She yells out, ""Sylvester, you're killing me""
I said, ""I swear that it went that way""
Then next thing you know, he bust up in the room said, ""Muthafucka freeze!""
And then I looked back up at him and said, ""Wait, you're that damn police!""
Then she screams, ""Baby, I mean James."" She says, ""Everything is cool""
And then he yells, ""Gwendolyn, I got this
I know you're sick and tired of this fool!""
Then I stood up, start walking toward him screaming, ""Man, get out my house!""
Then he yells, ""Freeze!"" She screams, ""Please!"" And I pulled my Beretta out
She cried out ""Sylvester, please don't!""
Visions of him making love to her
He said, ""Man, put the gun on the floor""
I can't stop thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun down and then I put my hands up
He winked at me and smiled
And that is when I went nuts
Hopped all over him grabbed the gun
She screaming, ""Settle down!""
Going all around both handling the gun then all of a sudden, POW"

Back in the days I used to say
'Can I get with you today?'
And you told me 'No Rob, no way, no how, not today'
I used to say 'Do you mind if we spend a little time?'
And you told me 'No Rob (No, Robert), no way, no how, not today'
I used to walk up to the girls, I said, 'Can I rock your world?'
And they told me 'No Rob (No, Robert), no way, no how, not today'
And I used to say, 'Can I knock your boots today?'
And you told me 'No Rob, no way, no how, not today'
But now that I'm all that, you see they used to call me wack
But now they say 'Yes Rob, come on, right now, you go, boy'
You see they used to call me stank

Yet you're telling me that everything is cool

Just go along and see things your way

And keep it on the down low

We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Secret lovers is what you wanna be
While making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this?
I feel there is something that I, I don't wanna miss

And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Coming by my way driving his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

And keep it on the down low

We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Listen, babe, I won't whisper a word
How could you go, so low, so low
Nobody, nobody, nobody

Pop,R. Kelly,2003,Chocolate Factory,Heaven I Need A Hug,"I'm just bein' real, you know
I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Ever since you left, your baby boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me, what am I supposed to do?
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high
I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like, if Jesus loved me, why He leave my side, mama?
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth
(For real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(For real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(For real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(For real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be yappin' off
Somebody out there please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me, and lift me up, oh yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin' ('Cause...)
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the ghetto with his paper and pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo, we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memories
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors, be careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine
(For real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(For real tho') It hurts to know you wanna see me fail
(For real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(For real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held
They turned they backs on you, who was there believin'?
Who said your troubles were only for a season?
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me, and lift me up (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and two brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another?
Instead of hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna I see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dine and me
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are higher
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fire
Frankly, y'all, to keep it real, I'm just tired
Dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is a liar
(For real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(For real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(For real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(For real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me
And as for Robert, here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
And media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
(Embrace me)
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
(Shower down on me now)
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah, yeah
(Said I'm callin' on...)
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
(Embrace me, yeah)
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me, and lift me up (Lift me up)
Yeah, yeah (Heaven, I need)
Heaven, I need a hug (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Said I'm feelin' like a change of heart (Hey)
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God (Ooh, yeah)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, yeah, yeah"

Why are you walking back and forth, pacing?""

""What am I to say?""
Because the truth of the matter is
That she just slept with another man today
And he started calling her name

Because the truth on her face
He will see it

Then he continues to rough up the midget as if the midget was under attack
Then Bridget runs up to her room, goes in her purse and pulls a number out
The police puts him on the table and yells, ""Man, what the hell you doin' in my house?!""
He wipes cherry pie crust off his mouth and says, ""Man I was paid not to tell you""
Then the police pulls his gun out and yells, ""Trespassin' man I've got the right to shoot you""
The midget says, ""Mister, the man that pay me to this would kill me if I tell""
He points the gun in his face, the midget says ""God I think I just shitted on myself""
Now at Sylvester's house, 'Twan got a patch on his shoulder playin' cards gettin' along
They're laughing and talking when Sylvester says, ""Gwendolyn, baby, get the phone""
Then she walks away from the table picks it up and says, ""Hello""
There's a lady on the other line, panicking, crying and talking all off the wall
Gwen says, ""Wait, slow down, tell me, who am I talkin' to?""
""My name's Bridget and I found your number in my husband's pocket, I had to call you""
Two minutes later Gwendolyn's shakin' her head sayin', ""Girl I understand""
Sylvester says, ""Who is it, baby?"" She hangs up and gives him the address
Now meanwhile back at the policeman's house, the midget is cryin' his ass off
While he lyin' through his teeth bout to get his little ass tore off
Then Bridget bust in the kitchen with a double barrel sayin', ""James I can't let you do this""
Then he looks at her and says, ""What? You'll shoot me for this fuckin' midget?""
She says, ""I love him"". The midget says, ""No Bridget""
And then James points his gun says, ""We all gonna die up in this kitchen""
Now Bridget and James are starin' each other down slowly backin' apart
Then the midget takes his inhaler out and says, ""This is not good for my heart""
Then James says, ""Bridget, don't make me do this, baby put the gun down""
That's when Sylvester and 'Twan bust up in the house and said, ""You put the gun down""
Woo, while 'Twan and Sylvester are sniffin' around
Tryna figure out what's that smell
As they turn and look at each other like, what the hell?"

True stories (what)

True blessings (what)
All because of love
I was riding in my car one day (oh)
In the express lane rolling down the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt, on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now
The doctor said I don't think he's gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
And for 10 years I've been straight
Chorus:
You saved me(woah) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
Now I've been sitting in the chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening
Cause its been so hard for me month to month
Struggling to eat but still there was no answer(no answer)
I stopped believing in his word And got so mad at him
When somebody say Gods good I just laugh at them(oh yeah)
And in the nick of time his blessing rained on me
By his grace the phone ring a lady says were hiring
And that's when I knew
Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
Now I was 18 out on the block selling drugs
With a gun at my waist And for people had no love
See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone
Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before I knew it I was on my knees
(Blood gushing out my body my hearts beatin fast
I don't know what I'm a do I don't think I'm gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the thing I've done in my past
(Then I heard a small voice that said to me I'll give you peace if u believe)
I accepted Christ that day hallelujah now I'm free
Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering where did it come from
(I got tested)and the results came back and the doctor said I'm sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it so I called up my mama to calm my nerve
(mama)she got down on her knees (mama)she said a prayer for me
(mama) said just keep on thanking Jesus (mama)he'll give you all you need
That was five years ago don't have that pain no mo
Doc says you can go home cause all your caners gone
Chorus:
You saved me (said you saved me) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me"
Pop,R. Kelly,1999,R.,If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time,"How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine

Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine
Oh I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you (If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you (If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you (If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back)
Oh oh, that would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darling I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)
I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands) Oh oh oh
(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

Now, usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron man, I'm just tryna take it straight
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
Sweetest girl in the world on me and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child
Telling myself I'm a player so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothing like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm bout to handle my business, the put that girl in my kitchen

Good intentions
I ain’t hard to please, I don’t need a lot

Someone who is patient and consistent
I need good sex and commitment
From somebody loyal, understanding, who won’t change up
Take advantage of my emotions or my feelings
I need good sex and commitment

I don’t want money
I'd rather effort somebody real
I can be myself around who makes me mad, don't make me cry
Who knows what it means to sacrifice
If I’m havin’ a bad day, you know just what to say
I can show you all my thoughts and where my demons play
And you won’t use them against me
You rather use them to lift me

Can you be there when I need you most?
Make me feel beautiful, give reassurance, forever

And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered up in your love

Even my skin is changing
I'm feeling warmer
No more icy blue hearts for me
You put the color back in my life
And now where there was black and white
You're becoming iridescent

And I got love all over me
Baby, you touch every part of me
Oh, I, I got love all over me
And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered up in your love

Before your love, baby, I was muddy
So deep with pain 'til you took it from me
You showered me with a new beginning, now I'm clean
Took me by surprise when you ran up on me
I came to life, baby, in that moment
You put your hands on my heart
And baby, now it beats

Now I got love all over me
And baby, you touch every part of me
Oh, I got love all over me
And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered up in your love
In your love, in your love
And I don't wanna get it off
I'm completely covered in your love
Oh, I ...in your love"

Give you more than little bit, give you everything I've got
Do you think of me like I think of you?
Hoping that what I feel is what you're feeling too
And I wanna go through a few things to describe
Just what's in my heart
There is no height that I won't climb
There is no light that I won't shine
There is no time that I won't find
And I'm so glad I found the time tonight
There is no other place that I'd rather be
There is no other face that I'd rather see
The way that you do me is somethin' like a movie
Waking up to you is just like waking up to Superman
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman
I can be your Lois Lane, Superman
There ain't nothing you can't do
I just wanna be with you
And I hope you feel it too
You're my Superman
It's beating in my heart, it's the shaking in my soul
Every time I touch you, baby I go
It's the power of your love, it's the passion in your kiss
That I'm always lookin' for
There ain't no sea that I won't swim
There ain't no void that I can't fill
And there's no time that I won't find
And I'm so glad I found this time tonight

Let me touch the sky, please don't hit the brakes
Fly me to the moon, I wanna see heaven's gates
I want to feel what it's like to be with superman
I'll stay by your side and if you take my hand
Then there's no dreams that we can't see
And there's nothing that we can't be
And there's no time that I won't find
And I'm so glad I found the time tonight

I may have done the things they say I did
But I'm not who they say I am
Try to throw my name in the dirt
But I really don't give a damn
I'm still standing like the statue of liberty
And I put my name in the history books
So you'll forever remember me
Remember me as the toughest warrior
Or the ultimate fighter
Cuz I'm the truth and nothing but

A week before the day you were born
I've been making big plans just for over a month
Trying to make this the best birthday
You ever had, show you that you're my baby
Damn, all this rain got me feelin something's wrong
Pullin up to my gate, they keep saying he's gone
An envelope's in between my door
Biggest day, got me panicking
What the hell's this letter gonna read?

Hell, no! You say you don't want it no more
Hell, no! You say you can't gimme what I want
Hell, no! How you just gonna leave
When I stayed with you through hard times and you cheated?
Hell, no! I hate to say it but I need it
Hell, no! Oh, God please talk to me
Hell, no! Your so-called love was so deep
When it told you you should run far
And not give a damn about me

How could you leave me
When you see me desperately in need of what we were before?
How could you leave home?
I cried so many times
But never did it cross my mind to ever let it go
How could you leave home?
Didn't even see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road
How could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby
Please my heart is beating for the beat we had before
How could you leave home?

Damn, I need you, wanna laugh, wanna stand
Wanna get just one more chance to see you
All my friends, all my kin say ""Mo, just let that end""
But I breathe you in the driveway
I found pictures on the ground of our first date
I never in a million years
Thought this would be me
I'm trapped in love with somebody
That no longer thinks I'm somebody special, look at me

Hell, no! You say you don't want it no more
Hell, no! You say you can't gimme what I want

Twista's Rap:
Monica and Twista y'all!
I remember when you said I couldn't get none of that
Then I remember when you let me hit it from the back
I remember we was young and sprung and steady talking on the phone
And we both kept running back to each other we was lovers together forever till the end
I don't really know why I froze up
Planning for a wedding but getting married is scary
Now I got you crying 'cause a nigga didn't show up
I can't really tell you why but I'm Twista from the CHI and I'm dying inside 'cause I know I really want you
So for leaving one day I'ma have to give you the answer girl
But right now I can't tell you why I left girl
Sweet personality and good sex girl
Fear will take a man's life. You supposed to be my wife. Goodbye, hope to see you in the next world
Monica's Rap:
You was all up under me
Acting like you was so in love
Always talking 'bout you a thug
Nigga what you running for?
Copped you a new Benz
You the first one seen on the block with it
Took you to the club
Showed you how to lean with it, rock with it
You was bold when you wanna get some of that
When you wanna hit the hole like running back
Now you actin like you wanna come running back
Hell No! Nigga I don't wanna hear none of that
I know you quick, but I spit that shit too so all I really wanna say to you is...how could you leave me baby how could you leave me baby

How could you leave me
When you see me desperately in need of what we were before?
How could you leave home?

That there's somethin' you want to say to me
'Cause usually right now
You'd be holdin' on to me
But instead you're tellin' me

And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go

Comin' in and takin' my place
Doin' the things that we used to do
And makin' love to you

It's killin' me 'cause I want you
And you should have known my love was true

Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of getting in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinking

I should make a move but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

We were chillin, watching your TV
I thought you were coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Try to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's getting too late
I'm thinking
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
(If) If you want me
You got to know me
And if you want my love
You gotta win my love
Hey baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me, get to know me
So we can do this
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

And I be losing my mind everytime I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you, baby
Caught up in somehting that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing
Something like R. Kelly singing 'bout a Jeep
Boy, you're everything to me
And you're my, you're my, you're my property

Boy, you remind me remind me of the ice on my ring
Boy, you remind me of this
These are the makings of you and it's true
These are, these are the makings of you

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time
We made love just like the 25th day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Clause to show up
You got a heart of gold, baby, you should know
Baby, you remind me of so much
And baby, you always stay on my mind
You're just like my rims, you shine

Boy, you remind me of 26s on my ride
The way you're spinning around looking like a superstar
Boy, you remind me of how life's supposed to be
How life's supposed to be
This is what you remind me
And you're my, you're my, you're my property
Looking at you look at another
Baby, I don't need another brother
Sex time around you I feel the same my body
There no pressure, baby
You know I keep it so real and
I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal? Tell me how you feel
Could it be me, me for eternity?

Like the ice on my wrist it's like kick on my hip
Mac on my lips, Armor oil on my whip butta on my shirmp
I'm the Gladys, you the Pip
I Keep my hair flip the way you like to see
Me strip keep a money clip
You remind me of a tip like a pair of jeans
From Abercrombie when they rip like a glass of wine
Everytime I take a sip it's you, you, you, you, you (Aw, baby)

You said forget about me and you
From now on, all you wanna do is hustle
You gotta choose, whatcha gonna do
What am I worth to you, baby

Never thought I'd be afraid to trust
Somebody that I love so much
If I can get him out of the streets
Then he can come back to me
Now I see that it ain't no rush
Baby, to me that's a definite plus
If I can't get you outta the streets
Then you don't need to be with me
Do you love me like you say
Then maybe you could get away

Pop,Monica,2002,All Eyez on Me ,I Wrote This Song,"I can't believe he's gone
Why'd you leave?
Sometimes it hurts so bad

He's the kind of guy that runs the street
But he treats me good
And he makes his dough illegally
That's how he's taking care of me
And I respect the fact
That he's chosen that life
But it keeps me up late at night
And I just can't spend my time
Wondering: Where he's at? Is he okay?
Wanna be by his side
But I commit a crime, Bonnie to his Clyde
And I don't wanna live that way

I love my baby so
But he's not here no more (no more)
Hard for me to understand (understand)
So I wrote him this song (wrote him this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm saying sweet goodbye

Though he promised that
He could never put me in harm's way
That it is something that he can't control
'Cause the game remains the same
And now he says he wants out of it
But he's in too deep
And the only way that he would go
Is killing him or leaving me
So this is where I'm at
And it hurts so bad
That I had to choose
If I wanna live or die with you

I love my baby so
But he's not here no more (not here, babe)
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song (I wrote you this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm saying sweet goodbye
I love my baby so
But he's not here no more (why did you go?)
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song (wrote him this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm saying sweet goodbye

I tried to give him hope
And promised him my life
But I don't know
What made him want to leave this life
And as he went away
A tear fell from my eye
And there's no turning back
There's only goodbye

I love my baby so (oh, baby)
But he's not here no more
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song (I wrote you this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind (oh, he cried)

When I look him in his eyes

Pop,Monica,2006,The Makings of Me,Getaway,"Started as a little girl
Singing soul changed my world
Flipped my world upside down
I got lost and I couldn't be found
So much on my shoulders
And so much on my mind
Seems no one can help me
I think i just need some time

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

Sometimes I wish I was invisible
'Cause then no one would know where I am
To ask me for anything
'Cause I've given so much of me
When is it time for me to receive?
'Cause Monica has her needs
Who's gonna look out for me?

Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

You know, I'm not superwoman
And I'm not made of steel
I try my best to handle
All I have to deal with
Not as easy as it seems
And to think this was my dream
Now for everything I have I'm grateful
But sometimes I wanna getaway

Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't stand my ground

That they can getaway"

Inseparable, that's how we were
Through anything, you were my world
I gave to you, you shared with me
For the love of you, i'd give anything
I would chill with you
You and your crew
Never complained 'bout the things you do
But it see it now, how it all went down
Can't take no more
Don't want you around

Never told me the whole truth
Now i'm wishing that i knew
The real you...
How could you do this to me?
Never hurt so much
I see, plans i made for you and me
They can't be...
These are the last tears that you'll see from me

Cause i ain't gonna cry no more
Cause i'm sick of you hurting me
I ain't gonna cry no more

I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause i'm tired of you, me and she

All your secret trips, just to see your kids
What about the crib that i've never been?
Is that the one that she lives in?

That the man he's not
The ""un-love"" affair will soon be forgot
And you will miss me, but i won't miss you

Is this my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't want to be

Just another name in your little black book
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook
I've got to mean a little more to you
Than a space in your list of things to do
Another g-shock gun in your Benz
Another dime piece
That you can show all your friends
You can call me crazy
Say I'm insecure
But I don't wanna be just another girl
Ooooh
Ohhhh
Ohhh
Mmm, hhmmm

Strange how you claim to tell all the truth
When the passenger seat
In your car has been moved
And you swore that there was no one else but you
And something else you can't explain
Why'd you called me by somebody else's name?

You say it's history
Your player days are through
Or so you say
Is this my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't want to be


Tell me how you lie
Or is it my suspicious mind
I've gotta know the truth
If I am just another girl you treated wrong
Another one you string along
Is it you and me?
Is it two or three?
'Cause I don't want to be"

Never thought that you would exist

To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away
And I can't stop caring about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doing without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you outta my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again

If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear I love you now and then
Will I never make love to you once again
Please understand if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you
That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again
Breathe again

And I can't stop thinking about
About the way my life would be
No I can't stop thinking about
How could your love be leavin' me
And I can't get you outta my mind
God knows how hard I tried
And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doing without
Without the rhythm of my heart
No I can't stop doing without
For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you outta my mind
Cause I know I can't deny it
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again

If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear I love you now and then
Will I never make love to you once again
Please understand if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you
That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again

'Til you showed me what you were about
Your true colors came out, oh
And your words couldn't hide the sin
'Cause the truth about where you been
Is in a fragrance I can't recognize

Just standing there, scratching your head
Bloodshot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
I'm done with this, feeling like an idiot
Loving you, I'm over it
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

There's no more you and I
I couldn't get it right on yesterday
So kiss our tomorrows goodbye
Baby, love should brought me home
Should've just been a man about it
But now I'm crying like a baby
Girl, your love was like my blanket
Don't know what to do without it

I'm standing here, pleading my case
You don't care to hear what I say
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge, oh no, baby
My promises don't mean nothing
The end is so disgusting

A silly game I stupidly played
I should’ve known from the start, I was bound to lose
But guess instead I kept running, running back to you
I let you win, now nobody wins

I’m sorry that I met you
I just should’ve walked away
I’m sorry that I let you
In my life and made you stay
I should’ve never loved you
You just showed me who you are
If none of this affects you
You’re sorrier than me by far
You’re so sorry

I…did plead
When you said to me
You wouldn’t do it again
Ooh, but you did
And now I see they were right, I was oh so wrong
And now I’m home alone singing sad love songs
I let you win, ooh, stupid again

And I’m sorry that I met you
I just should’ve walked away

In my life and made you stay
I should’ve never loved you

A solitary glance
And I could hear the voice of rapture call
I've loved you from a distance
Afraid to take a chance
But now it seems I can't help but to fall

Imagine my surprise
To open up my eyes
And find that you were looking back

And suddenly, I can not remember who I used to be
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms

I longed to awake beside you
And bathe in love's abyss
Washing all that comes before away
And in this frozen moment as I receive your kiss
There will not be words enough to say

I wanna make you melt, touch you like no one else
And do it all again a thousand times

And suddenly, I can not remember who I used to be
And like the rain this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms

I wanna make you melt, touch you like no one else
And do it all again a thousand times

And suddenly, I can not remember who I used to be
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea

You had to be tough
You told your friends
You had me wrapped around your finger
You were talking kinda cocky

That things were kinda shaky

Dead wrong to be

You threw my heart away
Told your friends
That you were running things
Why'd it have to be that way?

Why should I care
Why should I care

Back in the day
I shoulda been wiser
But what can I say
I shoulda been onto you
But I was afraid
That you'd break my heart in two
Fate would have it that you broke it anyway baby
And every time I close my eyes
I just remind myself
You told about a million lies
You put my heart through hell
And now you wanna get with me
Just for old time sake
Well I am not about to make that same mistake

Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care

You see a girl that you gave all your love
I see a girl you took advantage of
You see a girl that you cannot forget
I see a man that I cannot forgive
Tell me why

Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care

Back in the day when I was young
I wasn't afraid to love
Back in the day
You were the one what was I thinking of
Back in the day
Shoulda been wiser
Shoulda been onto you
But I was afraid I made a mistake
No one know"

'Bout the very first time that I saw you
And the first time that we kissed
I still recall the days of good old love we made
Without taking off our clothes
You spoke a language to my body baby
So universal, you and me talking baby

Ooh ahhh, oh my, ooh la la la la
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
Talk to me baby
Speaking in tongues babe with you

Maybe we could exchange
A little conversation
315-37 69 call me boy anytime
Don't nee no caller id, 'cause I won't have anybody
Interrupting our call
Talk dirty to me baby without talking at all
You got me singin' baby

Ooh ahhh, oh my, ooh la la la la
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
Speaking in tongues babe with you

How do we play pretend
How do we do not sin
And be together making love forever
Then I will fantasize
Make you up in my mind
And intimately I will cry

Ooh ahhh, oh my, ooh la la la la
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
Speaking in tongues babe with you"

Pop,Toni Braxton,1996,Secrets,In The Late Of Night,"Always thought your promise was for life
I did not think that I
Would hear you say goodbye
And I always heard you led another life
I doubted every time
I guess my love was blind
But in my eyes
Love was always something magical
But the feeling is so tragical
And all I know is in love
The thing I want most
I can't possess
There's only emptiness

In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
You lied
As you kissed me goodnight
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
I cried
As you kissed my lips good-bye, good-bye

In my eyes
You will always be the lucky one
'Cause you know you'll always have my love
For all times
Until I die
Through the end I give to you my best
You gave, you gave me loneliness

In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
You lied
As you kissed me goodnight
In the late of night
Just before I closed my eyes
I cried
As you kissed my lips good-bye"

The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
It's more to this than what you say
Cause in your sleep you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then cause the rain began, oh oh

Who was she foolin'? I had a clue, what she was doin'
Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention
I fell in her game and I'm so lost
Please stop the rain

Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you

And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again
And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again

An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you

I love you
I will never do the things she did
Take your heart and run away with it, no no
Cause I really really love you

I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end is here, and you can't change it

The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was workin' on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds

The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

Endin', endin', no
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
Yeah"

Pop,Brandy,2004,Afrodisiac,Talk About Our Love,"What ya hear this time
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lying
It's always somethin
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And now the whole hoods buzzin
He said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, we ain't gon stop
They just want what we got

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon show and prove

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

Heres a couple of things I can't honor man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Man
I'm wonderin why she ret ta go like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I trade in my cash
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around, giggled, said ""You so nuts!""
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get that new number
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out
I don't wanna hear it no more"

The way you used to love me
The way you used to hold me

Wish I could hold you just for a little while
Let me
I wish I could see you right now, but you're so far away
It's driving me crazy
I'm missing you, baby
And the way you touch me
It's unlike anything I've ever felt before
That's how I know I am yours

Let go and unwind

I wanna give into you

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
I can't hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
Will you please touch me?

I'm coming to see you
I'm wearing the dress that you like
I'll be on the first plane
I'll call when I get there, I promise
I haven't been sleeping, no
I've been thinking about the way you touch me
I'm losing all self-control
Feels like I'm letting go
And I'm loving every minute

Let go and unwind

I'm still here
I'm still waiting
What time are you coming?

Day and night I'm yearning for you to touch me
I'm thinking of you only, you are my everything
Said I gotta be your lady
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
I can't hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
Will you please touch me?
Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
And I love it when you're lovin' me
And you're kissin' me
And you're huggin' me
And you're touchin' me
Driving me out of my mind
Yes you are, yes you are
And soon as I see my baby love
He will touch me

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me"

I hurt when you hurt
I make mistakes, but I can't turn back time

I'm only human, forgive me
I'm only human, love me
I'm only human, save me, save me from myself
I'm no super woman, embrace me
I'm fragile and broken, you're just like me, oh
I'm perfectly human
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human
But I'm an angel in disguise

I'm staring in the mirror and a stranger's looking back
What are you afraid of, girl? The future or the past?
If you wanna see inside of me all you have to do is ask

I cry when you cry
I hurt when you hurt
I've made mistakes but I can't turn back time

I'm only human, forgive me
I'm only human, love me
I'm only human, save me, save me from myself
I'm no super woman, embrace me

I might just tell a lie

And everything that makes us different really brings us closer

Life's not over, I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over

I'm young but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right

But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was sayin' to love, ""Goodbye""
But I guess I'm only brokenhearted
Life's not over, I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over

No more empty conversation
Next time I will be totally sure
Don't want the pain of fallin' in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should know

So, I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cried
But I guess I'm only brokenhearted

Pop,Rod Stewart,1971,Every Picture Tells a Story,Maggie May,"Wake up, Maggie
I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and
I really should be back at school

I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face
Really shows your age
That don't worry me none
In my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother what a lover!
You wore me out

All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried


I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool

Or find myself a rock & roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway


Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Pop,Rod Stewart,2015,Another Country,Love Is,"And so you come to me with your questions
On a subject on which I'm well-versed
Though I'm still as dumbfounded as the first time I found her
It's either a blessing or a curse
Although I cannot offer solutions
It would be reckless of me to try
Cause it's mystified man ever since time began
But hold on to your hat and I'll try

Love is like a burning arrow
It can pierce the coldest heart
Love is warm, love is patient
And the craziest thing you'll ever start
All right

I recall when I was a young man
A day I'm never allowed to forget
There was a girl that I met who I dreamed I would wed
Forever our lives entwined
She said ""you gotta stop worrying about the future""
""You know we're far too young for that""
""I wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring""
I never saw her pretty face again

Love is life, love is yearning
It does not boast, but speaks the truth
Love is fair and knows no boundaries
And the craziest thing you'll ever do
Oh, yeah

I wish you well in all of your travels
And may you find what you're searching for
It'll hit you like thunder when you find one another
And stay in your heart forevermore

Love is like a four-leaf clover
Hard to find and hold onto
Love is blind, love is tender
And the craziest thing you'll ever do
So crazy"

Like a bird 'cross the sky
I am flying, passing high clouds
To be with you, to be free

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Thro' the dark night, far away
I am dying, forever trying
To be with you, who can say
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Thro' the dark night far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

We are sailing, we are sailing
Home again 'cross the sea
We are sailing stormy waters
To be near you, to be free

Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free

Are only winds of change

And I've been through the rain

And didn't I try to guide you to a baptism of fire?
Oh, didn't I?
And didn't I try to warn ya 'bout that folk in California?
Oh, didn't I?
But you said 'daddy, please don't worry, I got friends out there who love me'

Oh baby, come back home, we can work this out
There is no blame
I wanna hold you close and stroke your hair and share your pain

Didn't I do the best for you, try to make you stay in school?
Didn't I?
Once I was your hero but I went from ten to zero
Oh, didn't I? Now listen
For a roll on the dice you nearly paid the ultimate price
Oh, didn't ya?
Now I stand by your bedside, watching you fight for you life

When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience
The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were, well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance
You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey, what do you see in me?

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

You're an essay in glamour
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team, I've ever seen
And there have been, many affairs
Many times I've, thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
Cause you're the warmest thing, I've ever found

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose

On a downtown train

I know your window and I know its late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train

Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine just for Auld Lang Syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now in my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark

And we'll drink a toast to the blood red rose
Cheer a while the Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights and the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up! Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby

Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him?""

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way
Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George
Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of '75
He said he was in love, I said I'm pleased
George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell
Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm, they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down Fifth Avenue

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone
A leather kid, a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night
The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered, the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on Fifty-Third and Third

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote
He said, ""Never wait or hesitate
Get in kid, before it's too late
You may never get another chance
'Cause youth's a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast""
Georgie was a friend of mine
Oh yeah

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Oh Georgie stay, don't go away
Georgie, please stay you take our breath away
Oh Georgie stay, don't go away
Georgie, please stay you take our breath away
Oh Georgie stay, don't go away
Georgie, Georgie please stay you take our breath away
Oh Georgie stay"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1972,Never a Dull Moment,You Wear It Well,"I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
I've been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right
Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine
Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you, you wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind
But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get a letter through
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you
Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect
'cos I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out tryin' to get back to you
I love you, I love you, I love you
After all the years I hope it's the same address
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1971,Every Picture Tells a Story,Mandolin Wind,"When the rain came I thought you'd leave
'Cause I knew how much you loved the sun
But you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm
Through the darkest nights I've ever known
If the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Then I know I love ya

Oh, the snow fell without a break
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
I couldn't believe you kept a smile
Now I can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst
And I know I love ya

Oh, I never was good with romantic words
So the next few lines come really hard
Don't have much but what I've got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play
But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya


I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
La-da-da, la-la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da

The coldest winter in almost 14 years
Could never, never change your mind, ooh
And I love ya
Yes indeed, and I love ya
And I love ya
Lordy I love ya, woohoo
And I love ya
Lord, I love ya"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1978,Blondes Have More Fun,The Best Days of My Life,"You always said living with me was impossible
Try it I said just like the wind I'm changeable
We ain't got money but we sure got laughs
Lots of loving too
So I confess on my behalf
You're giving me honestly
The best days of my life

Your whispering girls said don't be a fool
Don't give into him
He's an animal treat you like dirt
Then he'll turn you in
You two are not compatible
It'll never never last
They said I wasn't even suitable
But you're giving me honestly
The best days of my life


Sometimes I wonder
Why does she bother with me at all
So staid in my ways
Let's face it, my dear, I'm insufferable
The crazy nights spilling into days
With all my noisy friends
But they all love you as much as i
Giving me constantly
The best days of my life

And a day without you at this point my dear
Seems unthinkable
A night without you more often
Than not is unbearable
But if it all can't work out
One can never never tell
In my heart there is no doubt
You gave to me unselfishly
The best days of my life


But if it all can't work out one can never never tell"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1984,Camouflage (Bonus Track Version),Some Guys Have All the Luck,"Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain

Alone in a crowd on a bus after work and I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
It seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain

Someone to take on a walk by the lake, Lord, let it be me
Someone who's shy, someone who'll cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was fooling me
You're just a dream and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain

All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone
Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one
The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way
I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain

But if you were here with me
I'd feel so happy I could cry
You are so dear to me
I just can't let you say goodbye"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1983,Body Wishes (Bonus Track Version),That’s What Friends Are For,"Oh, I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I've got a chance to say

And if I, I should ever go away
Well then, close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smilin' (Smilin')

Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For the good times (Good times)
And the bad times (Bad times)

And now, though you heard it all before
Well, I tell you one more time

Pop,Rod Stewart,1970,Gasoline Alley ,Gasoline Alley,"I think I know now what's making me sad
It's a yearnin' for my own back yard
I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride

Going home, running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home, and I'm running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born

When the weather's better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind don't whistle 'round my knees
I'll put on my weddin' suit and catch the evening train
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door

Going home, running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home, and I'm running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born


But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in my alley if I could
And if I'm called away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'll be asking of you
Don't bury me here, it's too cold

Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, won't you carry me home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Woohoo!"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1983,Body Wishes (Bonus Track Version),What Am I Gonna Do (I’m So in Love with You),"Can I tell you what you mean to me?
You're as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe that you're mine
You're like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
Yes, you are

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

One in a million, oh, so rare
A nightingale in Berkeley Square
And baby, I ain't goin' nowhere without you
You are the goal that wins the game
The very last bus home in the rain
You're like rock and roll and champagne
All in one

Something you've got is something I need right now
Let's not mess around anymore
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?
What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

I'll be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you any time
The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrow's fashion and now I've found you
I'm complete

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

I'm like a schoolboy in your hands
I wanna get up and sing and dance
You see one hell of a happy man standing here
Individually quite unique
You really swept me off my feet
And baby, you look, oh, so neat
With nothing on"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1996,If We Fall in Love Tonight,For the First Time,"Are those your eyes? Is that your smile?
I been looking at you forever
Yet I never saw you before
Are these your hands holding mine?
Now I wonder how I could have been so blind

And for the first time, I am looking in your eyes
For the first time, I'm seeing who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're looking back at me
Now I understand what love is, love is
For the first time
Oh yeah

Can this be real? Can this be true?
Am I the person I was this morning?
And are you the same you?
It's all so strange, how can it be?
All along this love was right in front of me

And for the first time, I am looking in your eyes
For the first time, I am seeing who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're looking back at me
Now I understand what love is, love is
For the first time

Such a long time ago
I had given up on finding this emotion
Ever again
But you're here with me now
Yes I found you somehow
And I've never been so sure

For the first time, I am looking in your eyes
For the first time, I'm seeing who you are
Can't believe how much I see
When you're looking back at me
Now I understand what love is, love is
For the first time
For the first time"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1991,Vagabond Heart (Bonus Track Version),Broken Arrow,"Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Can we make it so that's part of the deal
I've gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line, this time
I wanna breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that, hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didn't you show me a sign this time

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
Can you see what I see
Can you cut behind the mystery
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind
I wanna come when you call
I'll get to you if I have to crawl
They can't hold me with these iron walls
We got mountains to climb, to climb

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1972,Never a Dull Moment,I’d Rather Go Blind,"Something told me it was over
When I saw you and him talking
Something deep down in my soul said, ""Cry boy""
When I saw you and him out walking

I would rather, I would rather go blind, girl
Than to see you walk away from me, child
So you see I love you so much
I don't want to see you leave me, baby
Most of all I just don't, I just don't want to be free

I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace child
When the reflection in the glass
That I been held to my lips now baby
Revealed the tears I had on my face

I would rather, I would rather be blind, child
Than to see you walk away from me
Baby, baby, baby I would rather go blind
Than to see you walk away from me
Baby, baby, baby I would rather go blind"
Pop,Rod Stewart,1992,Unplugged... and Seated,Tom Traubert’s Blues (Waltzing Matilda),"Wasted and wounded
And it ain't what the moon did
I got what I paid for now
See you tomorrow
Hey Frank, can I borrow
A couple of bucks from you to go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
I'm an innocent victim
Of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English
And everything is broken
And my strength is soaking away to go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
Now the dogs they are barking
And the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me
You tore my shirt open
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old bushills I staggered
You buried the dagger
Your silhouette window light, to go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
Now I've lost my St. Christopher
Now that I kissed her
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinaman
With the cold-blooded smile
And the girls down by the striptease shows go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
No, I don't want your sympathy
Fugitives say
That the streets ain't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnet
And the ghost that sells memories
Want a piece of the action anyhow, go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
And you can ask any sailor
And the keys from the jailor
And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Matilda's the defendant
She killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
And it's a battered old suitcase
In a hotel someplace
And a wound that would never heal
No prima donnas, the perfume is on
An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street-sweepers
The night watchmen, flame-keepers
And goodnight, Matilda, too
Goodnight Matilda, too"

But it's from the heart baby
So please, please don't analyse the words

And on you baby I am sold

Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge

Oh no, not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation

Heartbeats silly like a big bass drum
Losing all equilibrium

But ain't love a bitch
I been in fights, locked away for nights
But ain't love a bitch
I been tailed, impaled, strung up
And nailed and left without a stitch
I been scratched and taxed and finally axed
But ain't love a bitch

Oh, I didn't understand 'til I was 17
She took me way upstairs and she wiped me clean
Oh, I didn't realise she made a first class fool out of me
Oh Maggie, if you're still out there the rest is history

You're all alone in the freezing cold
By the underground
Your hands are numb and you're feeling dumb
'Cause you been let down
You thought you were rough and kinda tough
And maybe out of reach
You're acting chic, playing hide and seek
But ain't love a bitch

Oh, I must state right here I been there before
My eyes were closed and so my friends
I still don't know the score
Oh, don't underestimate the strength of it
It may be unwise to analyse even the cause of it

You're driving home late one night and on the radio
Comes an old familiar song you used to know so well (You know a lot about that)
Oh, I can't comprehend this thing called love
Maybe it's a matter of fact I just can't grow up
Deep down ain't we all a little juvenile
All I really wanna know is there one sweet angel
That can make me smile
Ain't love a bitch

Torrential rains, wars and hurricanes
I wouldn't budge an inch
Your rent's unpaid and your team lose again
But ain't love a bitch
You can lose your job, your home and your health
But ain't love a bitch
Take it or leave it some day you'll feel it

Como en la vida, el amor es así
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imaginé enamorarme así
No tenías previsto sentir amor

El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Nada de lo que hagamos ahora es inmoral porque Cupido ya flechó
Si el amor es inmortal entonces la inmortalidad nos eligió
Tus labios son agua pura y mi mirada ya refleja el Kamasutra
Me gusta mi cama, pero prefiero la tuya

El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera
Porque a mi me da lo mismo
Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Que sea lo que Dios quiera (¡Motif! Yo te lo dije)
Lo hacemos a tu manera (Magnus, pero esta vez es con JLo)
Que sea lo que Dios quiera (lo mejor que suena ahora)
Lo hacemos a tu manera (desde Cuba, vamos a ver hasta que suba)"

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh

De ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?

Los poderes

Dos cuerpos entregados
Un par de enamorados
Flechados, cansados
Sudor desenfrenado
Cuando tú y yo nos juntamos
Sin piedad (Aquí no aguantamos)
Nos damos

Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

La la la eh, el sudor en tu piel
A mí me vuelves loco
Tus besos saben a miel
Ahora, eh!
Quiero tu desnudez
A mí si tú te vuelves lo hacemos otra vez
Cuando se pone el babydoll ¡Uf, arrasa!
Una copa de vino y tumba la casa
No sé qué me pasa
Pero cuando me abrasa
Con su fuego me traspasa
Y en el medio de la cama se entrega
Siempre pa' alante
Sabe como se breva
Y se pega, se pega

Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

Amor toda la noche
Bañados en sudor
Tenemos la fortuna
De perder el control
Se oculta la luna
Cuando sale el sol
Se pierde mi blusa
Y tu pantalón
Suma la cama
Resta la ropa
Bésame rico
Vuélveme loca
Así, así, así
Así, así, así
Sabes a cielo
Hueles a gloria
Dame la vida y la victoria
Así, así, así
Así
Yo quiero hacértelo lento
Tu cuerpo
Fluyendo así como el viento
Sin mezclar los sentimientos

Bien lento, muy lento (muy lento)
Para aprovechar el tiempo, contigo bebé (¡JLo!)

Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

Hay emociones que no puedes controlar
Y gente que te vuelve loca

Pop,Jennifer Lopez,2007,Como Ama una Mujer,Qué Hiciste,"Ayer los dos soñábamos con un mundo perfecto
Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espiábamos el alma
Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
Ayer tú me juraste que este amor seria eterno
Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

Mañana que amanezca un día nuevo en mi universo
Mañana no veré tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
Ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
Mañana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
Mañana ni siquiera habrá razones para odiarte
Yo borrare todos tus sueños de mis sueños
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

Qué Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para así romperme el alma

Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para así romperme el alma

Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa"

And the price to pay is my life
Give me the sword, bring all the knives
Hand me the gun, I will not run
And when they spare everything but my pride
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry
But when they ask who was the one
Who did you love?
Let it be me

If you ever meet your last breath
Let me be the last word you say
And if right comes, but you choose left
I will be the first to forgive

Oh, if Heaven is a beautiful place
But those gates don't have enough space
And they lock you out, spare you no flame
I will come down there on my wings
And when the angels call me a fool
For giving all my grace up for you
I won't look back, but when they ask
Who did you love?
Let it be me

Let it be me that you think of
When everything tells you to give it up
Let it be me that will anchor your soul

Until the clouds fall out of the sky
And the snow falls down in July
Let it be me that you think of
Let it be me, the one that you love
Until the flowers don't bloom in May
And forever runs out of days
Let it be me, let it be me

This love is so dangerous
But I kind of like the thrill
It's like a sugar rush
It's all in the way you make me feel
I didn't see you coming, but you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh

I gotta admit you're fly
And I love it how you talk, babe
Getting all in my mind
Running it like a field play
I didn't see you coming
But you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Don't you walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, and

This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux

I, deep down know I should be good
I ain't blind, you're the kind of guy
That always got all these girls running after you
Do I entertain or play with you? Or just be cool?
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh
Don't sleep, I think I'ma burn too fast
So close, wrapped up in the heat of love
I'm having fantasies of how it's gonna be
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, still

This ain't no ordinary boy

Yo, got Henny in the cup, Jenny knows what's up
She with a real one, not pretending to be tough
Got three cases, might have a warrant I don't know about
Beef I don't know about, weed I can't go without
My money used to pile up every beginning of the month
Unconditional love, in the beginning it was lust
Hustler, shooter, was a dealer on the block
Now my future's on top, no longer dealing with the thots
I don't go nowhere without the handle
Like I heard Lil' Boosie was out in Louisiana
Got friends in the feds, some dead over drugs
Fucking with me is high-risk but she still in love (We in love, baby)
Benny Medina might wanna pay me to leave ya
I'm bad for your image, the ghetto menacing diva
'Cause some say Nas is trouble
We all in, just ignore them nice guys is boring, I got you

This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do

I decided we should be friends, hey

And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there

A-won't you sing it with me?

If you put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation then
I'll guess I'll have to show you the door

Not sharing secrets with any old fool

Pop,Spice Girls,1999,Elton John and Tim Rice’s Aida,My Strongest Suit,"Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Now I believe in looking
Like my time on earth is cooking
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fibre of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect
From your cradle via trousseau
To your death bed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
Because dress has always been my strongest suit
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Staying in or hitting townwards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime
And the few who are invited
To my wardrobe are delighted
As they wander through my things to find en route
That in negligee or formal
I am anything but normal
Because dress has always been my strongest suit
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Now you don't need a recital
Of the reasons why it's vital
That tonight my trappings will not be subdued
That from coronet to sandal
No one else is worth a candle
That I couldn't make more impact in the nude
So bring me all my finest
Most audacious, mi divine-ist
Most revealing, most expensive and taboo
Most arresting, most heart-stopping
Most free flowing, most eye popping
Because dress has always been my strongest suit
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere"

And all you want to do is to cry out loud
But you don't know how
No way, no one, no one understands
The hand that strikes when just a touch of love is all the problem needed
And when you hurt someone so much that still they die loving you
And all you want to do is to cry out loud

I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl, I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? (let me in)
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely beating
You will see a different man

But baby here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you (come on)
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? (let me in)
I was running from the truth
Now I'm crawling back to you
Banging on your front door (darling)

I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you, want you tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh oh
No I can't resist and I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love

Thought I could fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh oh, oh oh
Hear the sound of a love so loud
I just can't
I just can't ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me, wants me tonight

The roses you left me slowly fading to grey
Your coat on the chair
And the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall
It reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park
And we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried

And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

Where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings
And someone said
""Hey we're locking the door, no time to play""

What happened when you shut down
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine

'Member when
You used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out?
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you'd put it in a movie
Maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

So hold on, don't let go
Hold on, and you'll know
Help is on its way

If you want to talk you can call
And no, it's not your fault
I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something I've just got to know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in
Yeah yeah, in my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been, oh

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head
When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
(So dark and mysterious)
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta' think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Baby I know you're askin' me to stay
Say ""Please, please, please don't go away""
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for somethin' more

Yes I gotta' have faith
Ooh, I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta' have faith, faith, faith

Made me cry

Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me ""No""
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

I'm blessed I know
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again
But now I know

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed and no one tried
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath you saved my soul
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all these tears
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began he took your love away
But I still say

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me
You will always be my love
Well I've been loved so I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side
Oh the lover I still miss... was Jesus to a child"

Every other kiss
That you ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you like I always do

Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears

Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for
If you ever should see him again
Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more
Someone who will protect you
Love and respect you
All those things
That he never could bring to you
Like I do
Or rather I would
Won't you show me your heart
Like you should
How can I help you
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain
That you're feeling inside
Whenever you want me
You know that I will be
Waiting for the day
That you say you'll be mine
Won't you let me in
Let this love begin
Won't you show me your heart now
I'll be good to you
I can make this thing true
And get to your heart somehow"

Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey (monkey)
With a monkey? (monkey)
Oh I count to ten
But I don't know how and I don't know when
To open my eyes
If you kiss me again
Like you did just now, like you did just then (just do it again)
I've had the rest
Now it's time I had the best
So you tell me that you won't do anymore
Well I'd write your heart a letter
But I think you know me better
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe
I'll get what I'm askin' for
(Chorus)
Oh I hate your friends
But I don't know how and I don't know when
To open your eyes
Yes the monkey's back again
Do you want him now like you did back then? (don't do it again)
I tried my best
But your head is such a mess
So I guess that I don't want you anymore
Well you say you care about me
That you just can't do without me
But you keep on dancin' baby
'Til that monkey has you on the floor
(Chorus)
(Monkey, monkey...)
Don't look now
There's a monkey on your back
Don't look now
There's a monkey on you

Keep on askin' baby, maybe
I'll get what I'm askin' for

Thinking to myself
You're a fool boy
Why don't you go down
Find somebody
Find somebody else

It's not as though it was yesterday
But something I just can't explain
Something in me needs this pain
I know I'll never see your face again
C'mon now
I've got to be strong now
Now everybody's talking about this
New decade
Like you say the magic numbers
Then just say goodbye to
The stupid mistakes you made
Oh my memory serves me far too well
Don't you know that
The years will come and go
Some of us will change their lives
Some of us still have nothing to show
Nothing baby
But memories
And if these wounds
They are self inflicted
I don't really know
How my poor heart could have
Protected me
But if I have to carry this pain
If you will not share the blame
I deserve to see your face again
C'mon now
You don't have to be strong now
Come back
Come back to me darling
I will make it worth your while
Come on back to your baby
I miss your kiss
I miss your smile
Seems to me the peace I search to find
Ain't gonna be mine
Until you say you will
Don't you keep me waiting for that day

You can't always get what you want"

Please just be there for me
The things that I know
Nobody told me
The seeds that are sown
They still control me
There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open
Take my hand
Lead me to some peaceful land
That I cannot find
Inside my head
Wake me with love
It's all I need
But in all this time
Still no one said
If I had not asked
Would you have told me
If you call this love
Why don't you hold me?
There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open
Give me something I can hold
Give me something to believe in
I am frightened for my soul

Make love to me, send love through me
Heal me with your crime

She is just some worried daddy's girl
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And she'll grow up in time
In her strawberry eyes
The way she sees you signifies
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies
But if you must lay her down
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
Please do not lead her on when, on when, you leave town
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
She's a woman now
With a daughter to make her proud
In her crayon world of paper clouds
She still remembers you
The first boy that she gave it to
And she laughs at how little then she knew
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy

Pop,Amy Grant,2010,Somewhere Down the Road,Better Than a Hallelujah,"God loves a lullaby
In a mother's tears in the dead of night
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes

God loves the drunkard's cry
The soldier's plea not to let him die
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes

We pour out our miseries
God just hears a melody
Beautiful, the mess we are
The honest cries of breaking hearts
Are better than a Hallelujah

The woman holding on for life
The dying man giving up the fight
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes

The tears of shame for what's been done
The silence when the words won't come
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes

We pour out our miseries
God just hears a melody
Beautiful, the mess we are
The honest cries of breaking hearts
Are better than a Hallelujah

Better than a church bell ringing
Better than a choir singing out, singing out

We pour out our miseries
God just hears a melody
Beautiful, the mess we are
The honest cries of breaking hearts
Are better than a Hallelujah

We pour out our miseries
God just hears a melody
Beautiful, the mess we are
The honest cries of breaking hearts
Are better than a Hallelujah

Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets

Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Wasted days, dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track
Looking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey

Felt somebody looking at me
With a powder white complexion, feeling the connection

Dragged me out the bar to the back seat of her car

When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
I can't forget

I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of a king size bed
Means I can't forget
My English love affair

A hideaway in Mayfair, all the great and good there
Drinking all the way to third base
Princes getting naked, falling on their faces

Every single step had me begging for the next

Dragged me up the stairs and it wasn't ending there

We're sitting there and you said you love me
What's that about?
You're moving too fast, I don't understand you
I'm not ready yet, baby I can't pretend
No I can't
The best I can do is tell you to talk to me
It's possible, eventual
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time
Here's how I play, here's where you stand
Here's what to prove to get any further than where it's been
I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice
Take it slow, you keep pushing me
You're pushing me away
Pushing me away

She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need

So much time
So much pain
But there's one thing
That still remains
The the way she cared
The love we shared
And through it all
She's always been there

Antes de ti no fui un santo
He pecado como no
Pero eso es cosa del pasado

Desde que llegaste tú
Lanzaste al aire la moneda
Fuera cara o fuera cruz
Ganabas como quieras

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causo
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto amor con un disparo al corazón

Cuantas noches de pasión
Cuantas mañanas tan vacías
Y un error tras otro error
Con estas sábanas tan frías

Desde que llegaste tú
Lanzaste al aire la moneda
Fuera cara o fuera cruz
Ganabas como quieras

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causó
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto amor con un disparo al corazón

No entendí cómo pasó
Con la destreza de un buen francotirador
Cada una de tus balas en el alma me pegó

Conocerte fue un disparo al corazón
Me atacaste con un beso a sangre fría
Y yo sabía
Que era tan letal la herida que causó
Que este loco aventurero se moría
Y ese día comenzó
Tanto amor con un disparo al corazón"

You want to rock the bop and take it home'

Why oh why am i gonna play
So many times it goes this way

These eyes are blown away

Do you remember how were were
Do you remember summer days
Sometimes i feel like going down down
Walk like a loaded man (down down)
Get the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul (down down)
Move like a thing, swing line a thong
And do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn
Load the rocket, shock it and rock it til you drop
Do the bump to the bump and don't stop
Loaded up from dusk til dawn
I wonder how she feels
Dancing around with my love
While i'm sitting waiting for the huh huh
Fired up that smoke screen
Red lipstick and high heels
Look at her now
She wants to rock the bop and take it home

Why oh why am i gonna play
So many times it goes this way
My heart gets blown away
These eyes are born again


Walk like a loaded man (talk like a gazombadam)
Get the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul

Tal vez fui yo que no te dio una noche entera
Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas
Y no estaba cuando me necesitabas
Tal vez no te escuche,Tal vez me descuide
Tal vez se me olvido que yo te amaba

Tal vez será que por ahora ya no hay nada que hablar
Tal vez esta vez necesitamos tiempo para pensar

Que por más que lo pienso no encuentro una sola razón para seguir sin tí

Y tú, me calientas cuando siento frío-oh! (Oh, oh)
Frío-oh! (Oh, oh) Frío-oh! (Oh, oh)
Me calientas cuando siento frío-oh! (Oh, oh)
Frío-oh! (Oh, oh) Frío-oh! (Oh, oh)
Me calientas cuando siento frío-oh!

Qué bella eres, me recuerdas las olas y el mar
Yo nunca olvido, como aquel día los dos empezamos a amar
Si pudiera pedir un deseo, quisiera que no fuera así
Eres la que nunca olvido, tan especial para mí
Qué bella eres, me recuerdas las olas y el mar
Yo nunca olvido, como aquel día los dos empezamos a amar
Si pudiera pedir un deseo, quisiera que no fuera así
Eres la que nunca olvido, tan especial para mí

Me calientas cuando siento frío-oh! (Oh, oh)
Frío-oh! (Oh, oh) Frío-oh! (Oh, oh)
Me calientas cuando siento frío-oh!"
Pop,Ricky Martin,2015,A Quien Quiera Escuchar,A Quien Quiera Escuchar,"Otro giro en la historia
Otra vuelta a empezar
Otro error, otro error sin memoria
Justo ahora, que empezaba a volar

Esta vez voy despacio
No sé bien, no sé bien qué pensar
Ahora que no lo andaba buscando
Va el amor y me vuelve a encontrar

Aquí queda, a quien quiera escuchar
Si lo sientes, díselo a la suerte
Si lo encuentras, hazlo para siempre
Una línea que el destino dejó escrita aquí a mi lado
Si el mañana es un error, quiero estar equivocado
Uoh, ho, ohh
Uoh, ho, ohh

No es el miedo en el alma, no lo es, no
No es la duda al entrar
Eres tú, eres tú, es la esperanza
Que me invitan a dejarme llevar

A quedarme sin armas, a quitarme el disfraz
A entregarme sin falta, solo al verte llegar
Y a sentirte en silencio
En silencio, cuando aquí ya no estás

Aquí queda, a quien quiera escuchar
Si lo sientes, díselo a la suerte
Si lo encuentras, hazlo para siempre
Una línea que el destino dejó escrita aquí a mi lado
Si el mañana es un error, quiero estar equivocado
Díselo a la suerte
Si lo encuentras, hazlo para siempre
Una línea que el destino dejó escrita a nuestro lado
Si el mañana es un error, quiero estar equivocado
Si lo sientes, díselo a la suerte
Si lo encuentras hazlo para siempre
Una línea que el destino dejó escrita a nuestro lado
Si el mañana es un error, quiero estar equivocado
Esa línea que el destino dejó escrita a nuestro lado
Si el mañana es un error, quiero estar equivocado"
Pop,Ricky Martin,2015,A Quien Quiera Escuchar,Mátame otra vez,"En mi estrategia no funciona el tiempo
Y la razón para ser tu rival
De-sármame, en-fréntame
Y si me hicieras preso de tu cuerpo
Esa condena cumpliría hasta el final
De tanto amar, soy criminal-al

Es un suicidio probar de tu boca si después te escapas
Eres tú, en mi piel acaricia en la herida

Mátame otra vez, mátame te ruego
Que no hay manera de morir más bella
Que en tus brazos, lento
Mátame otra vez, mátame sin miedo
Que yo prefiero perder esta guerra que empezar de nuevo
Sin ti, ohh
Ay, ay, ohh

Esta armadura que soporta el fuego
Se vuelve frágil a tu voluntad
Dis-párame, si eres capaz
Mi tortura es saber que mañana
Nada cambia todo sigue igual
Por-que te irás, sin avisar

Es un delito quitarte la ropa y que después te vayas
Eres tú, en mi piel acaricia la herida

Mátame otra vez, mátame te ruego
Que no hay manera de morir más bella
Que en tus brazos, lento
Mátame otra vez, mátame sin miedo
Que yo prefiero perder esta guerra que empezar de nuevo
Sin ti, ohh
Uhhh, oh

(Mátame otra vez)
Que me quiero, que me quiero, que me quiero ir contigo
(Mátame otra vez, otra vez, otra vez)
Ohh, de nuevo sin ti
(Mátame otra vez)
Mátame otra vez
Mátame otra vez
Mátame otra vez, otra vez, otra vez
Mátame otra vez"
Pop,Steps,2017,Tears on the Dancefloor,Story of a Heart,"It must have been him
Just a glimpse of a face in the crowd
That's all it takes
My heart is racing
I stand in a trance
As I stare at the back of a bus
Knowing there's no use denying
I can't stop thinking about us
The story of a heart
The story all of it mine
Then you took it from me
Every glorious line
I was safe and warm
And now I'm out in the cold
And I know I shouldn't have told my story
Story of a heart
I laid myself open wide
Yet to read the pages
Where the ink hadn't dried
All emotions pent up inside, my story
I try to resist
But the images keep coming through
So many years
Still I'm defenseless
The house by the lake
His hands resting awhile on the oars
Speaking with quiet conviction
Carefully unlocking doors
The story of a heart
The story all of it mine
Then you took it from me
Every glorious line
I was safe and warm
And now I'm out in the cold
And I know I shouldn't have told my story
Story of a heart
I laid myself open wide
Yet to read the pages
Where the ink hadn't dried
All emotions pent up inside, my story
Did he see me
Or did I just imagine it all
Putting a face on a stranger
A face I find more and more hard to recall
Never given up I look for you everywhere
Time went by and sadness took the place of despair
In a way you'll stay with me 'til death do us part
Like a shadow deep in my heart forever
The story of a heart
I laid myself open wide
Yet to read the pages
Where the ink hadn't dried
Swept away and lost in love
What was I to do
I just had to read it to you, my story
The story of a heart
The story all of it mine
Then you took it from me
Every glorious line
I was safe and warm
And now I'm out in the cold
And I know I shouldn't have told my story"
Pop,Steps,2017,Tears on the Dancefloor,Scared of the Dark,"What you can't see can't hurt you they say
But I've been blind too many times before
Never see it coming your way
Shadows and secrets hide
Give me the bright lights of the dance floor
To shine inside this broken heart of mine
The way you move, I'm forgetting all the ghosts in my mind
Just say your mine and stay by my side
Don't say you're leaving
Don't turn out the lights
I scream I scream I scream
Don't let the the darkness come and hold me
I need someone cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
And when the shadows creep up on me
If I shiver keep your body close to mine
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
I'm the kind who's always falling
Into trouble and into paradise
I don't love by half, I'm all in, I wanna be yours
Just say you're mine and stay by my side
Don't say you're leaving
Don't turn out the lights
I scream I scream I scream
Don't let the the darkness come and hold me
I need someone cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
And when the shadows creep up on me
If I shiver keep your body close to mine
Come on baby come and take me in your arms

Never be scared of the dark
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
Don't let the the darkness come and hold me
I need someone cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby come and take me in your arms

If I shiver keep your body close to mine
Come on baby come and take me in your arms

Pop,Steps,1998,Steptacular,Tragedy,"Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time in a world of tears I slowly drown
Going home I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feelings gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries
And you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you you're going nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control
And you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries
And you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no-one beside you
You're going nowhere

Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Oh, burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feelings gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries
And you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you you're going nowhere

When you lose control
And you got no soul
It's tragedy

And you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you you're going nowhere

And you've got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
It's hard to bear
With no-one beside you
You're going nowhere"

All the saddest love songs
Are symphonies in my head
I could choose to keep on loving a ghost
Or make new memories instead

With nothing left to say
When it hurts too much to kiss
Is it time to walk away?

All lie in the past
Like everything we had
All outta love and outta time
All that is left is the space between us
Went too far, can't put it right
It right
All outta tears, no more to cry
All that is left is the space between us
And I don't wanna lose my mind, my mind
In another place and time
Would our love outrun the end?
Would the battles we both fight
Flare up on us all again?
An eye for eye
That cast us in chains
And only why remains
All outta love and outta time
All that is left is the space between us
Went too far, can't put it right
It right
All outta tears, no more to cry
All that is left is the space between us
And I don't wanna lose my mind

I was blind to take it in
You build the world by promising with empty words
Acting glitter and gold
By the lies you told me that won't go away
Don't try to pretend
We can turn around and start it all again
Glitter and gold
There's no happy ending
Cause this is goodbye
The truth is too late
Only takes so much before my heart will break
And now it's too late
It's funny how the sweetest lies
Pass through your lips like candy
Another trick and you disguise
Another tale to tell me
I've heard
All the stories that you used
All the lines and broken truth
You make a fool believing you with empty words

You took a little then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you
I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I want to get you where I can let you make
All that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free

We talk about love
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you follow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you
You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is
Get in the middle of a chain reaction

And the last one standing can barely stand
Sometimes I feel our life is a struggle
And nobody even brought a white flag
Then I just look in your eyes and I'm melting
And I can't remember why I'm so mad

We fight and the tears are real
But when we surrender
We're better than ever

With hearts that just need to heal
But when we surrender
We're better than ever
When we're at peace, it's like everything's perfect
I couldn't imagine my life without you
But somehow a word can just lead us to fighting
You turn into someone that I never knew
Sometimes it's me, and I'm ready to quit you
A moment away from destroying our love
We're both getting wounded without throwing punches
But no one is winning, and enough is enough
It's a beautiful battlefield
It's littered with tears so real
But then when we make up
We finally wake up
It's a beautiful battlefield
With scars that just need to heal
But when we surrender
We're better than ever
It's a place made of dirt roads but they lead to a palace
And the fears that were so real vanish like ghosts
It's a place where I feel safe, where your arms always find me
And they're there to protect me when I need you the most
It's a beautiful battlefield
We fight and the tears are real
But when we surrender
We're better than ever
It's a beautiful battlefield
With hearts that just need to heal
But when we surrender
We're better than ever
It's a beautiful battlefield
It's littered with tears so real
But then when we make up
We finally wake up
It's a beautiful battlefield
With scars that just need to heal
But when we surrender
We're better than ever"

Nights getting colder, now we're far apart

The passion, the fire burned
But we knew that the end had begun
Those autumn winds couldn't wait
They took you so far and away
But just for a moment, yeah, we had it all
Now it's gone, like the September sun
Close your eyes, tell me, do you remember?
When we made out in the sand
Always knew, yeah, we'd have to surrender
We were dreaming in wonderland
Nights getting colder and now we're apart
I wish you were here in my arms
Summer has faded so fast
The feelings we had couldn't last
The passion, the fire burned
But we knew that the end had begun
(Those autumn winds)
Those autumn winds couldn't wait
(We had nowhere to hide)
They took you so far and away
(So deep into the night)
But just for a moment, yeah, we had it all
Now it's gone, like the September sun
It vanished as quick as it came
But it blinded my eyes
Oh, why do I still feel the same?
It all seems like so long ago
Just a moment in time
And if I could hold you again
Summer has faded so fast
The feelings we had couldn't last
The passion, the fire burned
But we knew that the end had begun
(Those autumn winds)
Those autumn winds couldn't wait
(We had nowhere to hide)
They took you so far and away
(So deep into the night)
But just for a moment, yeah, we had it all
Now it's gone, like the September sun
Summer, it went so fast
Feelings we couldn't last
Although a fire burned, the end had begun
Cold winds, they couldn't wait
Took you so far away
And now you're gone, like the September sun"

What doesn't kill you makes you so much stronger, stronger
Can you feel this pain?
Rushing through these veins
Driving me insane
But I won't break
I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
Dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher
Dancing with a broken heart
I'm gonna bury all the past just six feet under, under
I'm gonna make the staff of lightning and thunder, thunder
I won't let dogs lie
In the peace and quiet
Moving on to another time
I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
Dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher
Dancing with a broken heart

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

Some say, better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say, you were always there for me
Some way, when the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time and they fade away
And fade they away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

Someone said we got it all wrong (Someday, I wonder why)

Now you gotta goal that you didn't achieve
And I don't care I can't say the word

Pop,Natalia Oreiro,1998,Natalia Oreiro,Me muero de amor,"Te marchaste sin palabras, cerrando la puerta
Justo cuando te pedia, un poco mas
El miedo te alejo del nido, sin una respuesta
Dejando un corazon herido, dejandome atras

Y ahora me muero de amor si no estas
Me muero y no puedo esperar
A que vuelvas de nuevo aqui­
Junto a mi­, con tus besos
Es que me muero de amor si no estas
Me muero y no puedo esperar
Necesito tenerte aqui­, junto a mi­
Sin tu amor no puedo seguir

Entre tus papeles descubri­ una carta
Solo en li­neas apretadas, frases sin razon
Dices que el motivo fue la falta de aire
Si siempre te deje ser libre, sin una condicion

Y ahora me muero de amor si no estas
Me muero y no puedo esperar
A que vuelvas de nuevo aqui­
Junto a mi, con tus besos
Es que me muero de amor si no estas
Me muero y no puedo esperar
Necesito tenerte aqui, junto a mi­
Sin tu amor no puedo seguir
Dime que no es verdad, que voy a despertar
Cerca de tu piel, igual que hasta ayer

Porque me muero de amor si no estas
Me muero y no puedo esperar
A que vuelvas de nuevo aqui
Junto a mi­, con tus besos
Es que me muero de amor si no estas
Me muero y no puedo esperar
Necesito tenerte aqui­, junto a mi­
Sin tu amor no puedo seguir"
Pop,Natalia Oreiro,1998,Natalia Oreiro,Huracán,"Lo que digan
Lo que digan
Aunque digan lo que digan
Lo que digan
Lo que digan
Aunque digan lo que digan

Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán
Sólo basta una mirada
Y desato un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán
No me importa que murmuren
Porque soy un huracán

Y me enciendo con tus besos
Me desbordo si me amas
Soy el sol de media tarde
Soy la llamarada
También soy el agua fresca
Que se quema entre tus labios
Me gusta vivir así, amando

Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán
Sólo basta una mirada
Y desato un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán
No me importa que murmuren
Porque soy un huracán

Aunque tenga tanto fuego
Aunque sea como el viento
Aunque muera por tus besos
Soy un sentimiento
También soy cielo у arena
Y la sal que condimenta
Yo tengo para vivir, pimienta

Aunque digan lo que digan
No mi importa el que dirán
Solo basta una mirada
Y desato un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán
No me importa que murmuren
Porque soy un huracán

Y soy esa noche tibia que tanto esperas
Y puedo robarte el alma
Aunque tú no quieras
Aunque tú no quieras
Yo soy así que te quiero
Yo soy así, yo te siento
Yo soy así sentimiento
Yo soy así tanto fuego
Yo soy así que te quiero
Yo soy así, yo te siento
Yo soy así sentimiento

Aunque digan lo que digan
No mi importa el que dirán
Solo basta una mirada
Y desato un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán
No me importa que murmuren
Porque soy un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No mi importa el que dirán
Solo basta una mirada
Y desato un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán
No me importa que murmuren
Porque soy un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No mi importa el que dirán
Solo basta una mirada
Y desato un huracán
Aunque digan lo que digan
No me importa el que dirán..."
