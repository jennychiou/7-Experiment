Conditions: ( [s:genre] Pop [e:genre] [s:lyrics] An old man lived in the village) 


Of village green
Though his skin was so pure
There were no weeping trees
As we walked by
His eyes were so blue
I knew my birthday
We'd walked from the Sunday school
To a church with a lily-apple store
My daddy said, "Son, don't you start none now"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, let's go
Before your old age comes"

So we went walking down to the river
For a couple of days
Well, the river was so deep
There was a live oak tree
We were standing on the edge
Of the bed that's under the matted ground

He said, "I'll pick one up someday"
Then we headed down the road
To an old bar
Where we drank our beers
And laughed at the children
For being church-going
And playing on the street

We stopped into church
We got married in the street
With two lots of children
We got kids of our own
We still don't know our name
We may not have buried them
But we'll have some good things to do
They say that I went crazy
For being so normal

'Cause he said, "I'll pick one up someday"
And we picked one up someday
Then we headed down the road
To an old bar
Where we drank our beers
And laughed at the children
For being church-going
And playing on the street

We got married in the street
We got kids of our own
We still don't know our name
We may not have buried them
But we'll have some good things to do
They say that I went crazy
For so normal

An old man lived in the village
Of village green
Though his skin was so pure
There were no weeping trees
As we walked by
His eyes were so blue
I my birthday
We'd walked from the Sunday school
To a church with a lily-apple store
My said, "Son, don't you start none now"
