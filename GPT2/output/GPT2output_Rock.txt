Conditions: ( [s:genre] Rock [e:genre] [s:lyrics] An old man lived in the village) 


Of Mr. Johnson's outstanding favor
The village of Mr. Johnson
Kept the babies and the little girls clean
And the very first time they complained
The Yankee peddler stepped out of nowhere
Just to find a place for them to go
One day Mr. Johnson found a buffalo
Took him down to the river
Where the buffalo disappear
Nothing's sure what it was but some promises
That he kept in trust for the very first time
Nothing could be more wrong
From the moment that he stepped into town
His eyes were fixed on the village Green
Nothing could be more wrong
Nothing could be more wrong
Though he never had a suit orJew
But the little girls knew something about the buffalo
And they bought it whenever they could
Nothing could be more wrong
The buffalo turned into night
And it still remained there
To this very day [e:lyrics]
