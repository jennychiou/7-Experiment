<|startoftext|>Seems to me  
You don't care  
You don't want no fun  
You are always in the mood  
But love is my baby  
I've been waiting for your kiss  
Your love has just begun  
It's time I've had my first break  
I wish that every moment would have been mine  
  
Oh, it's so hard to swallow  
When you ask me if I love you  
And I don't understand why  
  
'cause I don't know who you are  
Who I can count on for one last time  
Who I will remember  
Who I'll be there for  
  
Oh, it's hard to swallow  
When you ask me if I love you  
And I don't understand why  
  
I'll remember you by my side  
'Cause I will be there for you, oh baby  
I will love you by my side  
I'll always be there for you

<|startoftext|>Shake I'm a weepy thing  
A' sighy, I never felt this good  
And what you told me of you lies here  
Till the dying of the night comes here  
  
Oh, when the afternoon is through  
Before the morning is through  
When the morning is through  
Oh, a' sighy, don't it seem a little strange  
To see everything still in time to know  
  
  
When the morning is through  
If you find some solace there's no need to cry  
Just to walk through the morning  
  
Oh, the morning is gone, the morning is gone  
  
I'll spend all the rest of my time, don't need to see  
Only you to know my joy in your arms  
  
But you can't wait until I'm through  
I'll leave you no more time  
  
Oh, don't it seem a little strange  
To see everything still in time to know  
  
Wait so long, now I can't wait, don't need to see  
Only you to know my joy in your arms  
  
The morning is gone, the morning is gone, oh, no more today  
No more tomorrow, oh, no more a' sighy, no more  
I'll see you down the way I'm thinking  
No more months, no more years  
No more my own, no more it's mine  
No more nights, no more  
No more days, my mind's's no more an' my nis

<|startoftext|>In my canteen, do you see a wonder?  
In the courtyard, well hello.  
  
Out in the hall I'll get to you.  
Out in the hall I'll see your face.  
  
I got to start the fire of your life.  
For the italian fare will be delicious.  
  
You just may remember my fated meeting.  
I swear the place will be crowded.  
But that ain't a thing you will ever know.  
  
Out on the street, you could take my place  
Out on the street, you could do you.  
  
Out in the canteen there's the newspaper you will be buying.  
Out in the canteen, he's not too far.  
Out in the canteen, to the kitchen and I'll eat.  
Out in the canteen, the cupboard is half full.

<|startoftext|>I was there for you  
  
I was there for you  
  
You were there for me  
I was there for you  
  
You're close to me  
I'm close to you  
  
The past is there, my friend  
So easy to forget, but the past  
You and me, a life worth saving, a life worth saving  
We'd love to go back there, that's the only thing you ever seemed to miss  
When it comes to love, it's just easy to forget  
  
  
When you think about me  
Just now I realise what I've been through, for you and me, a life worth saving, a life worth saving  
We'd love to go back there, that's the only thing you ever seemed to miss  
When it comes to love, it's just easy to forget  
  
  
But it was I who you wanted to get closer, I never looked back at you  
I was there for you, oh oh, I was there for you  
I was there for you, oh, I was there for you  
  
There will always be someone who cares  
And when you see that face you know that I've been waiting to say goodbye  
Cause it's only for a lifetime, it's only a lifetime, and there's a chance it will be forever, and I'm not going there, oh, oh, oh

<|startoftext|>I ain't gonna tuck my clothes  
I don't know how and I don't know where

So now I got to let it slip away

And run to the phone,  
Put down my crazy-looking smile  
And let it slip away  
  
Slowly I make my way to the door  
I'm bringing all of my love to my love  
Hold your door open and I'm not afraid to see  
  
Slowly I make my way to the phone  
I'm bringing all of my love to my love  
Hold your door open and I'm not afraid to see  
  
The fire is filling my room and it's turning out to be tiny  
The dreams I dreamed that I never dreamed to have, are flying away  
I'm gonna tuck my clothes, baby  
And run to the phone,  
I'm bringing all of my love to my love, baby  
Hold your door open and I'm not afraid to see  
  
I'm gonna tuck my clothes  
I'm not gonna tuck my clothes  
I'm not gonna tuck my clothes

<|startoftext|>I wake up in the morning, listen to a voice.  
Darling  
Wait the day is through  
Falling asleep at night  
I need a good night  
Oh no, I do not believe that  
  
I'm holding the bed, I need a good night  
I cannot believe that I'm leaving the bed  
  
Walking on this floor, I'm laying a good night  
What the dreams are doing to my heart  
I'm being offered no place I can be  
  
I want to tell you that love is waiting  
Holding my breath, I'm my own worst enemy  
I'm alone, I'm out there, can't be anywhere  
I can't know your meaning  
  
I'll pray for you, my dreams are safe  
Ascend from the sky, move in a new direction  
You and I, why can't you listen to my voice  
A bad woman, I'll be your best friend  
You're to a good man.  
  
You're a fine man, my dream is your heaven  
A woman, a good woman, for you and me.  
They have to give a good night  
We are drowning in the ocean of sorrow  
You'll never get back to your wife

You're all that I need, my dreams will wait  
To your wife.

Laugh like me but you got to find

Just to know you're not alone  
  
How can I get through my day  
I am tired and my legs are sick  
You got to understand this  
And I'm all like you  
I'm just like you, how can I stay  
  
All I ask is your love for me, girl, will you change your mind?  
I want your love, for my baby, will you let me down

The child cries for a mother, the child cries for a mother  
No one can hear what you say no one can see you or me  
  
All I ask is your love for me, girl, will you change your mind?  
I want your love, for my baby, will you let me down

<|startoftext|>Is there any life at all inside the long silent cage  
I've been living here and now it's time to move  
Is there any memory at all here I can think of?  
No matter what I try, I know it's always going to end  
  
Now, if you feel there's no time to regret,  
I can be there, I will love you when I die  
All that's left is to smile and smile and smile  
  
Take a chance, you don't have to take a big risk  
Have a few glasses, you don't have to pay a price  
Cause you're just human and you'll never be alone  
  
Oh, honey you can count on me  
Hold on a little longer, you might just walk away  
Cause I've got everything I need, and that's all I can give  
  
Well, you could always tell me something  
Well, what a call this number there's no number  
I'd even come back by  
All you do is whisper in my ear  
Do you remember the time we knew?  
Cause it's here, in my heart and my bones  
Just know, whatever is to be  
There's gonna be somebody here for you, baby

<|startoftext|>So this morning I dreamed you were  
  
I was sleep you awoke me  
My thought comes to mind  
Some say we had love  
And love I would not divorce  
But I know that we were separated  
When I was so young  
  
So dear the hours tick away  
To a girl that's just going to grow  
I can feel you I can't resist the temptation to call you by my name  
You know I'm made of dreams I love you just like all others  
  
Now now I know there's not a true love like me  
So all I'm in search of is the right time  
To be with you one more time, but I know it won't be long  
So I'll meet you on the other side of the bridge  
  
But still I'm a bad man I know I'm  
Oh, only a bad man can love you  
For long enough to know, you still care for me



 -------//------ 

<|startoftext|>Ah, alway I'm talkin' bout you  
Make my body weak and hard to resist  
Sometimes I can't resist it no more  
Ah, give me all my freedom

Give me all the enjoyment  
Oh, I can't resist  
Oh, give me all my freedom  
Say what I know I just don't care  
Give me all my freedom  
Say what I know I just don't care

<|startoftext|>When my baby called me,  
Let's had our evening party,  
And when I fell asleep,  
My first thought was,  
You think we would, would wait?  
  
For my dear brother  
I was waiting for you  
For my dear friend  
  
So I went to your room  
You made love to me,  
With all your might.  
  
So I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you.  
  
So I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you.  
  
So I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you.  
  
So I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you.  
  
I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you.  
  
Then I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you,  
  
I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you,  
And I had my dear friend,  
  
So I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you,  
Then I had my dear friend,  
  
So I went to your room,  
Then I told you I love you,  
  
Well I said to myself,  
There's still nothing here that I can do to try to convince you of my love,  
But when I do try to think about all of the love that I hold,  
There are times when I wonder if you even care.

<|startoftext|>Ran on the roof, can you do it?  
Can you do it?  
  
Here comes the first kettle  
The second kettle is falling from the sky  
The third kettle is dropping down  
Hearing the way the drum can sizzle  
  
Tearing the raillines to shreds, who are you?  
Well, I am your face.  
Can you find the tune?  
Can you find the voice?  
Can you feel the pain?  
Can you see the reflection?  
  
Someone touch the holy water  
Bring the sun to the soul

We will not lie

Didn't he tell you to say so much to me?  
Why have I been out there to you?  
  
Don't tell me to love you I have lived so good for so long  
Just come on and try to talk to me about this.  
The joys and sorrows of love I have only come to know this way  
  
If I'm wrong about love let my luck always come around again  
'Cause I know I'm not going to be with you anymore.  
  
So come on and talk to me, you know the words you speak  
Didn't you know it was just your own way  
I'm in this, I'm in this, I'm in this.

I want some other way  
I don't really have time  
Don't really have no way

Your heart is so open

<|startoftext|>Fly away is the way  
To wake up  
  
I've been so alone  
My feet are so heavy  
And I can't understand  
How I've been thrown off a boat  
That I can barely hold on  
So why don't you take my hand  
Have a feeling that I'm going to  
Go on and tell me that I'm going crazy  
Don't you see there's a call for action  
  
I have only one hand in mine  
But I know that there's still a reason to think in a different way  
To break down the lines  
Forget the strong, the strong and the weak  
For a lifetime we'll never try to make it better  
  
It seems so strange when all I have been told  
Is that there is nothing more to say  
Don't feel like trying anyway  
And when you ask me to get off the line  
I know I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy crazy, crazy, crazy  
Got to find my feet, feet, feet  
That I can't stand on the very last island  
  
So be the one to get off the line

<|startoftext|>Bold light  
Sigh, best when light is first  
Concept shall begin  
With dawn that's oh so clear  
  
Was I fool  
I did not speak in the choir  
As I loved you so well  
Did I make mistakes?  
Was I rude  
'Cause it was my way  
All I had to do was to learn  
Some day I will be strong enough to rise  
And say "From here let's have a dance"  
  
Did I care for you a lot  
Never could do without you so good to me  
Did I call you by your name?  
Did I have a liking for you?  
I'm not sure I just now  
To really know where to look  
My heart was so full of knowing but no realness  
Did I leave you love you so much?  
Did I leave you all the rest of my time?  
Were you really too good for you?  
I'm not really sure  
To say I'm so proud of you, from all my love

<|startoftext|>We grew up in the city  
We would have come out with the hottest breath  
Ow! We had a chance.  
I'd never give up a thing  
When I found love  
Ahhh! I'd never give up a thing  
When I found love.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm so ready to be free!  
I'm gonna make it pay!  
Yes, the voice of truth, from within  
Waves of wisdom have been calling me to grow up and walk a new path  
No, just have faith.  
  
I'm on my feet again  
I'm walking again, everywhere  
If the wind is blowing down at you, you gotta come back to me  
The secret is such a long way away  
For the sunshine, the myriads  
Ohhh! I'm on my feet again!

To see the power in my heart  
Are we not the world?  
Is no more then only then  
Can you see that we are each other?  
Is there no more then just then  
Can you see that we are each other?  
  
So now is your time to be free  
Are we not the world?

<|startoftext|>Geddie, I'm gonna sing a song  
  
Glad you understand  
Mmm,  
I'll always be there  
  
Awkward girl at my knee  
Look at your mouth  
Never say a word  
  
My old man says, "Dancin' with G. M. Ruf"  
Walking down the avenue, I see your face  
From the shadows that you are hiding  
  
You ask my old man to move to the front of the line  
(See my mind)  
Can you hear my old man's call  
Geddie, Geddie, I need your hand to love me.

<|startoftext|>Take the newscaster's line and try to resolve it  
Everyday life is a newscaster  
It's only the station for me

I keep my family when I'm out on the street  
When the newscaster shows that he's not trustworthy  
  
  
All I have to do is leave it in the channel  
All I can think is to take my eyes and eyes out of my mind  
All I can be on my own on my own  
  
I will show you the truth about this story  
I will give you that precious thing

After a lonesome night  
Shakespeare in sorrow, anise singing, chimes before the grave  
  
Tears, song and dreams, will last for years  
A lyric poem in memory of the road  
And the drink the last light  
To walk the Earth!  
  
  
Back to the trees!  
There's a place for you  
  
Back to the trees!  
There's a place for you  
  
The pastures will be trees  
  
The forest will be vulture land  
  
The scum of the sky will be the land  
  
The rivers will be grey, pure and clean  
  
The winds will have a great blow  
With the dam, gannets and the sea  
  
Back to the trees!  
There's a place for you  
  
Back to the trees!  
There's a place for you  
  
  
Back to the trees!  
There's a place for you  
  
The woodland will be tree and no grain to grind  
  
There will be the time of day  
When the dreams are bought and sold  
  
The rivers will have a great blow with the dam and the sea  
  
Back to the trees!  
There's a place for you!

Baby, you don't know what to do  
Baby, I don't want to die  
'Cause I don't want to lose you, baby  
  
When you're feeling down, baby  
Baby, please just hold me tight, baby  
This is my little heart, baby  
I swear I can't live without you, baby  
  
When you're feeling out of luck  
I mean baby, you know you gotta find a way  
I mean I want you to stay right here, baby  
  
When you feel like there's nothing to say

Locked in a sense  
Just let your heart stay  
In a sort of pain  
Where's a world in, for those who have no name  
And it's a telling of a tale  
We must hear what you're saying, oh, oh  
  
A dream is a book in which you were wanted  
A love worth all a song, a lie, a dream  
  
Just let your face stay  
Locked in a sense  
Just let your heart stay  
In a sort of pain  
Where's a world in, for those who have no name

Where do you think you're going  
Until you find the light?  
  
You're walking down the street  
Where do you think you're going

And every time you look at my window  
It's a sight that I'll remember  
  
A huge sense of realness  
When I look into the light  
  
You're walking down the street  
Where do you think you're going  
Until you find the light?

Try to think on it, you've been thinking about

It's all up to you,  
But take this 'til the river is dry,

We will die together  
We will watch the grass grow under your feet

You should know better  
But it'll be only a lie if you do

We will never forget you

You should know better...  
You should know better...

We got out on the open road  
Did a lot of a lot  
And the truck lagged a lot  
Before we all ran out of gas  
  
And it drove me crazy  
I got into a dream to break up my load  
Somebody said go there just got me going  
I guess we got it all wrong  
But I was hungry and I just had to find a fast way to  
  
Walking along the highway  
Looking for a change in my way  
But I still ran out of gas  
  
Walking along the highway  
Looking for a change in my way  
But I still ran out of gas  
  
And I guess we got it all wrong  
But I was hungry and I just had to find a fast way to  
  
Let's do what we gotta do  
'Cause we got no choice  
Everybody just had to call  
And if I wanted to be free I had to leave it behind  
  
Oh it's been a long, long time  
And I really want to tell you how glad I am to know you  
  
And I know that my Lord I need some compassion now  
'Cause I ain't a peaceful man  
'Cause I'm a quick and fearless and holy man  
I'll scream at the top of my capacity  
In case you find I'm not the cause of the psalms  
  
  
They say that we don't need the weather any more  
But I ain't nothin' right  
'Cause when I came down from my high  
I had to see you up close and was surrounded by a red  
The sky and the day were blue before I was standing  
I was just a silly young lad without any nothing to say  
  
I had to run over the truck again  
'Cause there was one piece of green  
And I didn't want to leave it behind  
I ran and I just fell off of my horse  
  
We got out on the open road  
Did a lot of a lot  
And the truck lagged a lot  
Before we all ran out of gas  
  
But I guess we got it all wrong  
But I was hungry and I just had to find a fast way to  
  
Everybody's going back to  
So I guess we got it all wrong  
Everybody's gonna wonder where we got 'em from  
  
Walking along the highway  
Looking for a change in my way  
But I still ran out of gas  
  
I knew I had to find a fast way to  
Find a way to leave it behind  
  
I had to find a fast way to find a way to get me back home

<|startoftext|>My Dreams Are Afraid To Match The Visions They Define  
My Despair Have Of Long Been Plaid  
Let Your Skin Untie My Blood  
So Come On And Dream  
Can it be true?  
Let your life be free to me  
  
And when the night is through, when you're alone, when your mind is distracted,  
Let your mind be her  
Come on and Dream, can it be true?  
Can you dream?  
My children wish their childhoods would end,  
Though I haven't seen the day, I've heard the voice of love.  
  
Dream... So come on and Dream.

I can't help feeling  
I can't help feeling the pain I've known

You'll remember my name

I know your future is my career,  
And to the desert you'll be king,  
The likeliest love you'll ever know.  
  
I'm growing weary of our tears and doubts  
But still you keep pushing on me,  
And in my day I wanted to change your mind.  
  
I'm wondering how you've been through  
I always wondered  
Have I never written myself a song in my head.  
  
Love to meet you and know you better  
Love to see you as my end.  
'Cause I love you for all the people you're hurting me,

'Cause I love you so much, and I know I'll get the love I need,  
'Cause love you are giving.

<|startoftext|>Look through your window, little window  
My face may break, I'll lose my way  
  
What have I been doing?  
I can't see the world around me  
I can't understand why, I can't put me out of my misery  
  
I know there's something you've been wanting  
To say you're sorry, but I can't resist  
And if you break down, when you're all alone  
I'd know, if I wanted to, I'd be there with your matter  
  
You say you love me, you even give me my name  
But you never knew  
We've been looking through the window, baby, a little window  
  
But it's too far  
I've been living in the house for a while  
But my mind can see the second one  
  
All of your life has been so far  
The rivers won't flow  
  
But we may be dead, baby  
Or alive in our arms  
  
You say you love me, you even give me my name  
But you never knew  
We've been looking through the window, baby, a little window  
  
You can see the window, baby, what the window says  
My eyes can see the window, my eyes, I can see the window  
  
What have I been doing?  
I can't say I'm going crazy  
My mind won't run so wild  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love, in love in love  
But my mind won't understand the meaning of my life  
My mind won't stop looking at the window  
  
There's another window in the house, baby

<|startoftext|>I don't want no pity  
  
When I live in the night  
No one around me  
Can run or hide  
Sometimes I wish I had a foot  
On my back  
  
When I am free  
Well  
If you're ever gonna take a chance on me  
You're gonna make it better  
You're gonna make me a better man  
You're gonna show me, I can feel  
Just as well you can  
Take a moment  
And have a little taste  
The thought of some sweet sweet revenge  
Like my man once loved you  
And your own mother and I, you have my way



 -------//------ 

<|startoftext|>Like the three worlds-I'll fade away  
But at least my life to be with you is one thing, one thing  
You can call my name.  
  
The path I must take  
Begging for a change and to satisfy the hunger I can no longer satisfy it,  
And every day the pain it brings me down  
  
You are the light that I had to bear,  
The light that I was in need of.  
You are the lightning that kept me bound  
You are the tide that makes a heart even to know it's not safe.  
  
I can love you, yes I love you.  
I love you so strongly, I can't bear to let go.  
I love you so hard, I'm afraid to let go,  
Because love has the power to stay.

<|startoftext|>You can believe it when you look inside the window  
When you say goodbye  
  
When your heart's on the roof  
You can go home again  
When your heart's on the roof  
  
You can dream it out a million miles  
Never need a town.  
  
Dance a thousand feet underground  
Hold your hand in mine  
Ohhhh.  
  
Dance a thousand feet underground  
Hold your hand in mine  
Ohhhh.  
Ohhhh.  
Ohhhh.  
Ohhhh.  
Ohhhh.

In my bed.  
Cause it's only me and my baby

Until they disappear  
  
Did you sleep while I slept?  
Did you dream about me?  
There was so much I wanted to do  
And all I thought was as strong as I could  
But something I think about  
  
I am wondering  
What should I do?  
Can't sleep anymore.  
Can you sleep?  
Oh.  
Oh.  
I don't want to hurt your baby  
'cause I don't want to steal her away  
  
All my loving hurts  
My heart is still me and baby  
All my memories will only be mine  
And when you finally fall asleep  
And no words I've learned  
There is so much I want to do  
And all I thought was as strong as I could  
But something I think about  
  
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Oh that's the way  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Oh that's the way  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Oh that's the way  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Oh that's the way  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Down from the crossroads, you journey deep into the night  
Oh that's the way

<|startoftext|>Living life to the fullest, now that you're free  
Oh, how happy and sweet is my life  
  
When it's all said and done, what do you need to say  
When you're grown-up  
What do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to do, what do you want to be  
What do you want to do, what do you want to do, what do you want to be

<|startoftext|>I'm breaking the cambered trees and the grass is sick  
I'm standing on the rail and I'm breathing gas  
The electric can't go through the lines  
But I'm running off an air hose and I'm in bed I can't wait to break out of my  
Manin bad while I'm ill  
  
And I'm begging you please don't tell me where we're going  
I want a trucker to come and I need to see you can see my time  
And I want a suicide and I want a peace of mind I just want one  
Here comes the other night I'll never do it again  
  
I'm breaking the cambered trees and the grass is sick  
I'm standing on the rail and I'm breathing gas  
The electric can't go through the lines  
But I'm running off an air hose and I'm in bed I can't wait to break out of my  
Manin bad while I'm ill  
  
Why can't I get it from the other side of town  
Why can't I get me from there and why is a cat from back here  
Why can't I find my way in a plane of trains  
I guess I could have thought it would be better if I could get your call I wish I could have known

<|startoftext|>Somebody once told me, "What do you want to do  
And why do you feel the need to leave?"  
  
And I heard a voice saying, "Every time I look in your eyes  
And every time you speak I feel your heart break.  
Why do you need to write  
Because why are you still gonna pretend?"  
  
I tried to understand, my big sister  
But I knew that she wouldn't see.  
No one knew my love from afar.  
I remember trying to write my little heart away, oh, little heart.  
Oh, my little heart.

<|startoftext|>It's a little late  
We've seen your face  
Your life to me was a long time  
I wish you'd find your own way  
I wish you could let yourself to know  
I'm here to remind you why  
You're running in circles with the dead  
  
We've got no chance  
(Everybody running and the dead)  
To change our ways  
We are the dead, nobody cares  
  
I wish you'd find your own way  
I wish you could let yourself to know  
I'm here to remind you why  
You're running in circles with the dead  
  
It's so hard  
To watch you die so fast  
You can't stay alive  
I wish you'd find your own way  
I wish you could let yourself to know  
I'm here to remind you why  
You're running in circles with the dead

<|startoftext|>What's my name?  
  
Go  
  
Tell me  
Why did you keep a secret  
Why did you leave the key to the kingdom  
Why did you keep a secret?  
  
Why did you love me?  
Why did you make me feel guilty?  
Why did you try to ruin my love for ever  
  
Why did you love me?  
Why did you fail to hate me?  
Why did you act so proud?  
Why did you ignore me?  
Why did you feel so proud?  
  
Is it right?  
You know it's time to let go  
And if I, with my rage, only keep some



 -------//------ 

<|startoftext|>But I don't know what to say  
We live in the shadow  
  
So true, so true  
We cannot let it go  
We'd better get away with it  
  
And no matter what I do  
I never want to lose it  
This time can't be wasted  
The things I like are only for sale  
  
One word you can say to me  
I'm feeling good now  
When I think we're all together  
I'm feeling better now, now baby  
  
'Cause I'm feeling good now  
When I think we're all together  
I'm feeling good now baby  
One word you can say to me  
I'm feeling good now  
I'm feeling good now



 -------//------ 

<|startoftext|>Here I stand  
There you are  
Under the skin  
Rise up  
Take your place  
If you dare  
No other man  
Can stand  
He might seem strange  
  
Take your place  
If you dare  
No other man  
Can stand  
He might seem strange  
  
Take your place  
If you dare  
No other man  
Can stand  
He might seem strange

<|startoftext|>Maybe the fields  
Keep you happy  
Maybe they're right  
  
Maybe the trees have been left behind  
Maybe they were born a long, long time  
  
Or maybe you've been around  
And it ain't very long now  
  
Don't you know the dance you had with the moonlight  
  
But, your heart's not got a whole lot to say  
Don't you know the road you're going down  
  
So dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
