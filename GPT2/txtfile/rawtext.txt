Where the old men pray
His children lived next door
They used to live in the woods
But this man's religious bone
He didn't have a prayer
No, he didn't have a prayer
He just said I've got to find my own way home
And I've got to find my own way home
If I can do the things he says
That I just can't understand
Then I'll just settle down and start living for today
Lord, how I'd love to settle down
And start living for today
Lord, how I'd love to settle down
But I don't have a prayer
I don't have a prayer
No, I don't have a prayer
Sometimes, I think of what a wife must be
And how I hate to do things
That he doesn't have to do
But then somehow, I think of what hope is
And do I have to start
Oh, oh, I'm ready to begin
Oh, how I'd love to settle down
I'm ready, ready, ready
If I can do the things he says
That I just can't understand
Then I'll just settle down and start living for today
Lord, how I'd love to settle down
And I don't have a prayer
No, I don't have a prayer
Always, always start the day
Lord, how I'd love to settle down
I'm ready, ready, ready
If I can do the things he says
That I just can't understand
Then I'll just settle down and start living for today
Lord, how I'd love to settle down
But I don't have a prayer No, I don't have a prayer
I can't do the things he says
That I just can't understand
Then I'll just settle down and start living for today
