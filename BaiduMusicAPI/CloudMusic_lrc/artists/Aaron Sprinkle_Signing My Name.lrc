Showing your self 
In an unusual way 
I understand you now 
Your secrets safe and sound 
Minding my own 
Business is not something new 
But it takes some self control 
Not that you would know (chorus) 
I'm my own man now it's easier 
Climbing the staircase wondering what's to see 
My oh my how 
This does turn things quite around 
Tomorrow will be 
Here before you know it dear 
Signing my name 
In through the window you peek 
I'm fixing my mistakes 
Is this all that it takes (chorus)
