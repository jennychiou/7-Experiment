[00:35.66]Swear I'm running out of all my lies
[00:38.37]And every single time I made you cry
[00:41.05]Lying to you saying we'll be fine
[00:43.74]We ain't fine
[00:44.92]Cuz first you tell me you love me

[00:56.73]And I will do anything for it
[00:58.16]Cuz there ain't no one above you
[00:59.48]I ******* hope that you know it
[01:00.78]And just because I love you
[01:01.90]Doesn't mean I know how to show it

[01:40.33]I know you find it hard to let go
[01:42.21]And you deserve much better but we both know
[01:44.73]That both of us are way too scared to be alone
[01:47.43]You know you should leave but you still won't, no, no
[01:51.43]Cuz even when you do nothing
[01:52.88]Girl I still turn it to something
[01:54.08]You say I'm too busy ******* around
[01:55.55]Just drinking and clubbing
[01:56.80]And if I'm really in love with you
