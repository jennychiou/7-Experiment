[00:05.34]Just wait
[00:07.71]Though wide he may roam
[00:10.94]Always
[00:13.57]A hero comes home
[00:20.85]He goes where no one has gone
[00:26.01]But always
[00:28.84]A hero comes home
[00:36.12]He knows of places unknown
[00:41.27]Always
[00:44.21]A hero comes home
[00:51.13]He goes where no one has gone
[00:56.31]But always
[00:59.10]A hero comes home
