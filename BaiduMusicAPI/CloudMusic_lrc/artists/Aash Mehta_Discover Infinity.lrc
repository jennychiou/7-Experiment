[00:42.79]Is this reality?
[00:45.99]Or crazy fantasy?
[00:48.63]It doesn't really matter
[00:51.56]'Cause the line's been blurred
[00:53.76]Is this a part of me?
[00:56.57]'Cause as far as I can see
[00:59.35]I don't really know the difference
[01:02.11]Between my two worlds
[01:04.57]But maybe, our heart's afraid
[01:09.73]Afraid of our future, just miles away
[01:15.05]But when we find our way
[01:20.59]Find our new infinity
[01:23.70]And fly away
[01:26.66]
