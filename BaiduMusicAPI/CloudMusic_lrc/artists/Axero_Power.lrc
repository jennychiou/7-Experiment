[01:19.86][00:04.89]Sport has the power to change the world,
[01:24.60][00:09.53]It has the power to inspire, it has the power to unite people
[01:31.87][00:16.72]In a way that little else does
[01:36.40][00:21.61]It speaks to youth in a language that they understood
[01:41.94][00:26.89]Sport can create hope
[01:45.67][00:30.65]Where once there was only despair
