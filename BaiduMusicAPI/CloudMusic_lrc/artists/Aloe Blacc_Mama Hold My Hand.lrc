Cross this road
When I was just a little boy
Well, I would go out to play
And I would wander so far from home
That I would lose my way
And I'd call my momma to help me
And she'd come right away
To help me get back home where 
I wanna be
And here's what 
I sayMomma, hold my hand
I don't think 
I can cross this road by myself
Momma, hold my hand
I don't think 
I can cross this road by myself
And when I was a young man
I would go astray
Didn't want nobody to hold my hand
Wanted to make my own way
And my momma would come out to help me
But I push her away'
Cause I just wanted to be on my own
And here's what 
I sayMomma, leave my hand
I been waiting to cross this road by myself
Cross this road by myself
Well, now that 
I'm a grown man
And I moved away
I got a house, a nine to five and my wife
We got a kid on the way
Momma told me that life's gonna get rough
Take it day by day
But every once in a while 
I get scared
And I wish 
I could say
Momma, hold my hand
I don't think 
I can cross this road by myself
Momma, hold my hand
I don't think 
I can cross this road by myself
Now my momma is near the end of her years
And her hair is gray
Sometimes 
I call her to ask her if she would like
To spend the day
Momma used to be strong but she ain't now
And she can't make her way
That's why 
I'm always around when she needs help
And here's what 
I sayMomma, hold my hand
I don't think you can cross this road by yourself
Momma, hold my hand
I don't think you can cross this road by yourself
