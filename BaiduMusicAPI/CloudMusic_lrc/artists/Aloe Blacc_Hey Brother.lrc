Hey there, brother, watch your little lady
She's a little faster than you think
Hey there, brother, watch your little lady
She'll be sneaking 'round everytime you blink
Now I don't know if she got my number
But she's been calling all through the summer
Saying she really need to see you brother
Now don't that make you wonder
Hey there brother, hey there brother
Hey there brother, watch your little momma
She's a little hand full, yes she is
Hey there brother, watch your little momma
She got herself a hand full, yes she did
Can't you see you're getting played you fool
She's letting everybody take it as cool
All up in the backyard shooting pool
And I don't mean to sound cruel
But hey there brother, hey there brother
Hey there brother, look what she's doing to you
Hey there brother, she's playing you for a fool
Hey there brother, look what she's doing to you
Hey there brother
Hey there brother, what's with your girlfriend
She ain't being loyal, no she ain't
Hey there brother, what's with your girlfriend
You should hear the things that she's been saying
Well the word on the street is that it won't be long
Before she packs up and moves on
She's just using you like a comb
Now don't you think it's wrong
Hey there brother, hey there brother
Oooh, hey there brother
Look what she's doing to you
Hey there brother
She's playing you for a fool
Hey there brother
