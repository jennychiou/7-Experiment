[00:22.95]Down to earth in the dirt
[00:24.42]Used 'em up so I'm out of words
[00:27.25]Barely breathing
[00:29.37]Still alive as samurais
[00:30.97]Cut me up and down the sides
[00:33.81]Stop the bleeding
[00:35.93]Did I say, say I know anything? Cause I don't
[00:42.28]But I will pay, pay double just to get what I want
[00:48.27]I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
[00:54.75]I keep swinging
[00:58.08]Makes no sense, but I go again
[01:00.20]Cause I, I might be just dumb enough to keep on trying 'til I die
[01:07.65]I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
[01:18.64]Steady odds in the eyes
[01:20.36]Out of luck, but I roll the dice
[01:22.99]Still believing
[01:25.16]Keep the faith, no time to pray
[01:26.52]Warming up for a Hail Mary
[01:29.56]Got that feeling
[01:30.97]
[01:31.53]Did I say, say I know anything? Cause I don't
[01:37.43]Yeah, but playing safe, safe isn't really playing at all
[01:42.39]At all
[01:43.45]
[01:44.01]I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
[01:50.48]I keep swinging
[01:53.65]Makes no sense, but I go again
[01:55.94]Cause I, I might be just dumb enough
[02:00.54]To keep on trying 'til I die
[02:03.42]I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences
[02:15.68]
[02:17.30]It's hard when the fire keeps crawling up your sleeves
[02:20.23]And it's harder than you ever thought that it could ever be
[02:23.26]And a light in the dark is all you wanna see, you wanna see
[02:30.08]And it's hard when the fire keeps crawling up your sleeves
[02:33.02]And it's harder than you ever thought that it could ever be
[02:36.24]And a light in the dark is all you wanna see, all you wanna see
[02:42.00]
[02:42.95]I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
[02:49.22]I keep swinging
[02:52.46]Makes no sense, but I go again
[02:54.99]Cause I, I might be just dumb enough
[02:59.68]To keep on trying 'til I die
[03:02.32]I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
[03:09.57]I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
[03:16.14]I keep swinging
[03:19.73]Makes no sense, but I go again
[03:21.54]Cause I, I might be just dumb enough
[03:26.18]To keep on trying 'til I die
[03:28.87]And I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences
