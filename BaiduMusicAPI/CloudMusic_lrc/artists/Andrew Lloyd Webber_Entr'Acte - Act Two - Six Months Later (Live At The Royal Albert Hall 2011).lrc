[00:00.99]Entr'acte (Act Two - Six Months Later) - Andrew Lloyd Webber
[03:16.04]Monsieur Firmin
[03:17.83]Monsieur Andre
[03:25.20]Dear Andre, what a splendid party
[03:28.68]The prelude to a bright new year
[03:31.55]Quite a night, I'm impressed
[03:33.55]Well, one does one's best
[03:35.42]Here's to us
[03:36.30]I must say all the same, that it's a shame
[03:39.54]That Phantom fellow isn't here
