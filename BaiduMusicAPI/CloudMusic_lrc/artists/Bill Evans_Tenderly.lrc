Tenderly
-Patti Page

The evening breeze
caressed the trees Tenderly
The trembling trees
embraced the breeze Tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
and lost in a sigh were we.

The shore was kissed
by sea and mist Tenderly.
I can't forget
how two hearts met breathlessly.
Your arms opened wide
and closed me inside
You took my lips
you took my love so Tenderly.

Your arms opened wide
and closed me inside
You took my lips
you took my love so Tenderly.
