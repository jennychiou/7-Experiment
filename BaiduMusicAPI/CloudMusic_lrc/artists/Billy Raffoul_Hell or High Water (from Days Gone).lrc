[00:14.66]You never know what tomorrow may bring
[00:21.40]The woman lyin' next to you could be a memory
[00:29.52]I've idolized, I've memorized your face
[00:36.37]Just in case, I need it last me eternity
[00:43.34]It's a shame that it ain't enough for me
[00:51.50]Life's for the the livin', I won't be givin' up
[00:58.51]'Cause you taught me how to, you taught me how to love
[01:06.04]Take all I cherished, beat me 'til my body's numb
[01:13.33]But life's for the livin', I won't be givin' up
[01:19.51]On you, on you
[01:27.29]On you, on you
[01:50.12]I should have known, should have tried to hold on
[01:57.90]And never left your heart where it don't belong
[02:05.14]If the wind would change, bring you back again, my love
[02:12.30]Come Hell or high water, we will rise above
[02:19.88]You are what I believe in
[02:22.84]You are enough
[02:27.03]Life's for the the livin', I won't be givin' up
[02:34.70]Oh, you taught me how to, you taught me how to love
[02:41.97]Take all I cherished, beat me 'til my body's numb
[02:49.20]But life's for the livin', I won't be givin' up
[02:56.32]On you, on you
[03:03.36]On you, on you
[03:12.71]Even though, I know you'd tell me to
[03:17.14]
