Ballin, Ballin, Ballin, Ballin...


You think you're ballin cause you got a block?

He think he ballin cause he got a block?

You know these hoes came to see me ball

You know these hoes love to see me ball


You think you're ballin cause you got a block?

He think he ballin cause he got a block?

You know these hoes love to see me ball

You know these hoes came to see me ball


Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone

Think I forgot to put my roof on

Said “f-ck it, buy another car”

Hopped out the Lamb'

Said “f-ck it, bought another car”

I bought the Phantom just to say it's black

I bought the Phantom just to take a nap

I'm getting head in the backseat

I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete

I'm ballin' hard, I need a jersey on

So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home

I'm on them Diddy's, spendin' Dirty Money

I'm on that Jizzle, spendin' my money


You think you're ballin cause you got a block?

He think he ballin cause he got a block?

You know these hoes came to see me ball

You know these hoes love to see me ball


You think you're ballin cause you got a block?

He think he ballin cause he got a block?

You know these hoes love to see me ball

Still ballin' like a muthaf-cker, tell ‘em that

Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques

Ain't got nuttin' gold but some gold chains

Say “Jizzle, what's the dough?”

Move the whole thang

My celly bumpin' like a chat line

He bought a 500, need he, need a halftime

If yo job ain't ballin' hard, then you need to quit

You need a A T hard, then you need to split

Summer's mine, winter too

I'm poppin' bottles in the club, that's what winners do

They claiming *****es, them my old hoes

They claim they ballin' in my old flows


You think you're ballin cause you got a block?

He think he ballin cause he got a block?

You know these hoes came to see me ball

You know these hoes love to see me ball


You think you're ballin cause you got a block?

These hoes call me Tunechi baby

N-ggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating

*****, I'm ballin', ballin' like a muthaf-cker

12 gauge, *****, I got a dozen of them

N-gga broke, acting like he got it though

I'm with a Spanish *****, if she aint f-cking, adios!

So many cars I'm like eenie meenie minie moe

So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope

Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat

Run in ya house, and get to poppin' at your shower cap

My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac

And if them b****** don't sell, we buy em back

Where the strippers, tell em Tune on his way

Tell them n-ggas I'm strapped like lingerie

I aint trippin, I'm ballin, call me NBA

I-I aint trippin, I'm ballin, call me NBA
