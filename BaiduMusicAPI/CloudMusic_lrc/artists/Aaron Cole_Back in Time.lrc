[00:26.82]I dropped my cup
[00:31.41]Spilt it on the floor
[00:38.72]I get the feeling
[00:44.52]I've been here once before
[00:46.76]
[00:52.89]I lost my heart
[00:57.12]Somewhere on the road
[01:06.19]I guess I'll rest
[01:11.11]I'll rest when I get old
[01:17.15]
[01:46.11]In every way
[01:50.26]Every way I miss you
[01:57.44]Wish I could go back
[02:03.52]Back in time just to kiss you
