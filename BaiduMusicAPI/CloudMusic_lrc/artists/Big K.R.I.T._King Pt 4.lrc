[00:00.063]Intro: DJ Drama
[00:00.063]Let's go, K.R.I.T
[00:01.541]See when it comes to god given talent
[00:05.373]And whenever form is given
[00:07.807]Most of us learn our journey at a early age
[00:11.034]Sometimes the worlds teaching
[00:13.577]Guides us to the highest path
[00:15.998]Other times, the teacher negates our gifts
[00:18.822]And blocks the shine
[00:21.654]I'm here to tell you
[00:23.590]When you're destined for greatness
[00:26.344]No roadblock can stop that journey
[00:28.966]Don't follow the leaders, be the leaders
[00:32.155]Verse:Big K.R.I.T
[00:32.558]I was prepared for the worst
[00:34.554]Dug in deep, cause I emerged from the dirt
[00:37.017]My ***** said "You ain't the only one"
[00:38.930]But in truth, you got to be the first
[00:40.564]Cause you can see the good and the bad
[00:42.516]And you'll turn down the bad
[00:43.980]That's a gift and a curse
[00:45.155]I envy your will to be a better man
[00:46.807]In a world where a better man
[00:47.741]don't even stand a chance on this earth
[00:49.427]Bible talk, they told me that I can keep that
[00:51.927]This time I'll leave the sheep where the sheep at
[00:53.447]And I pray that when the wolves fall through
[00:55.094]Their stomach still full, so they won't eat that
[00:56.917]Which is mine? I really think I'm wasting time
[01:00.202]Worried 'bout my people and all they sayin'
[01:01.704]f*ck me cause I was too determined to ball
[01:03.381]But if you knew that you could fly,
[01:04.567]***** why did you fall?
[01:06.399]I'm feeling like LeBron more than ever
[01:07.619]They givin' ***** the praise,
[01:08.916]but I'm knowing that I'm better
[01:09.800]So, f*ck a ring if it don't make me a great
[01:11.806]Why you doing too much? I'ma do what it takes
[01:13.808]I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a boulder
[01:16.140]That a giant wouldn't even bother to hold up
[01:18.615]Like, Krizzle why you carrying this?
[01:19.977]Cause it ain't enough soil I can bury it with
[01:22.068]And it ain't enough weight, that's the scariest ****
[01:24.215]That means I was built for more, trial and error
[01:26.216]Almost burst into tears when I saw my brother's kids
[01:28.178]Like I coulda have this, I gotta keep it together
[01:30.288]But I've been chasing, way too much chasing
[01:32.511]They'll never give me what I deserve, just face it
[01:34.751]f*ck faking, f*ck pretending like you know my story
[01:36.851]Or what it's like to be mistaken as a basic
[01:38.222]Country bumpkin, watermelon
[01:39.717]Chicken-eatin', collard greens
[01:40.801]Neckbone chillin' motherf*cker
[01:42.761]We're the butt of all jokes grew up here
[01:44.604]And we'll show you have no clue of what it's like to be southern
[01:46.514]Knowing you a king and in spite all you dream
[01:48.607]Had to be a nightmare for you to wake up
[01:50.920]And those two hour meetings with the label betting money on
[01:53.081]Another excuse that they'll scrape up
[01:54.881]For me to do it out of pleasure, another pay cut
[01:57.646]And they wonder why a ***** never say much
[01:59.774]I never was the begging type
[02:01.117]I couldn't picture this ****, I never cared for likes
[02:03.211]I never cared for what your opinion would be
[02:05.530]And even if I did, ***** shame on me
[02:07.486]I live my life, a hundred f*cking miles and running
[02:09.193]Only for a ***** to sit
[02:10.397]and try to tell me something about the music
[02:12.186]Culture, consumer, vultures
[02:13.620]The music that I make ain't for radio, bogus
[02:15.683]The people just wanna hit the club and have fun
[02:17.533]And I don't make that kind of **** and that's really the culprit
[02:20.278]Art is art no matter how you sculpt it
[02:22.068]Mold it, grow it, only to go unnoticed
[02:24.156]Cause nowadays we just focus on them thots
[02:26.061]And ****** selling kool aid on a soapbox
[02:28.600]I'm imprisoned to my mission, screaming listen
[02:31.105]Lord I wish I could stop
[02:32.986]I wish I could tell them 'bout the book
[02:34.528]But they caught up in the movie, lights and the props
[02:37.557]The pyro, and the award shows and the fancy clothes
[02:43.564]And well-offs, extorting the have nots
[02:48.160]Man, f*ck this ****
[02:55.112]Skit: Big KRIT & Unknown Old Head
[03:04.630]Aw, ****. Look it here. Here he go.
