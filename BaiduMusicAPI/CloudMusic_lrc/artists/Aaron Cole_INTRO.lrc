[00:01.97]I've had some good days
[00:09.67]I've had some hills to climb
[00:17.57]I've had some weary days
[00:23.95]And some sleepless nights
[00:32.70]But when I, when I look around
[00:39.97]And I think things over
[00:48.86]All of my good days
[00:54.73]Out weigh my bad days
[00:59.31]I won't complain
