[00:08.325]I spent my years trying to open doors
[00:12.188]Hoping I'll find what I was searching for
[00:15.844]I swear you made it all worth the wait
[00:22.808]
[00:22.978]I promise that we'll make all our memories how
[00:26.568]You told all your friends that you dreamed about
[00:30.005]You made me find something real
[00:34.856]Find something real
[00:37.885]
[00:38.036]If clouds block the sun and rain on our parade
[00:41.254]I'll see the light through the trees like I did the day
[00:45.005]You made me find something real
[00:49.839]Find something real
[00:53.607]
[00:57.342]Find something real
[01:00.123]You made me find something real
[01:04.889]Find something real
[01:08.831]
[01:26.805]I'll put my heart on the line for you
[01:30.497]I'll move the oceans if you wanted me too
[01:34.588]So you know that it has all been worth the wait
[01:41.267]
[01:41.457]I promise that we'll make all our memories how
[01:45.159]You told all your friends that you dreamed about
[01:48.892]You made me find something real
[01:53.507]Find something real
[01:56.663]
[01:56.805]If clouds block the sun and rain on our parade
[01:59.969]I'll see the light through the trees like I did the day
[02:03.720]You made me find something real
[02:08.516]Find something real
[02:12.453]
[02:16.140]Find something real
[02:18.972]You made me find something real
[02:23.521]Find something real
[02:27.507]
[02:41.269]You made me find something real
[02:46.083]Find something real
[02:48.868]You made me find something real
[02:53.467]Find something real
