Boss said, "Mac, I need to see you It's Friday afternoon about five We had to make some cuts around here Sorry, Mac, you won't survive" 
He sat there stunned in silence 
The hard word's ringing in his ears 
Couldn't believe all the years he'ed given 
Suddenly had disappeared 
His first thought was, "how do I tell her That I lost my job today?" 
As he left he felt so wounded 
And his boss just slipped away 
He wondered where's the justice 
When I gave it everything 
I got? And driving home the fire kicked in 
And the feeling sorry for himself just stopped 
He said, "I ain't gonna go the way of the buffalo I will not go quietly the way that they want us to be Driven from the only life we've known I ain't gonna go the way of the buffalo He held her close as he told her the news Prepared for her to cry As the afternoon sun was going down He saw a different look in her eyes She said, "
Baby you've always been my hero 
So hold your head up tall and proud 
Let them take away everything we own 
But we ain't going down 
We ain't gonna go the way of the buffalo 
No, we will not go quietly the way that they want us to be 
Driven from the only life we've known 
We ain't gonna go the way of the buffalo 
As they stood there in the darkness 
She reached out ant took his hand 
She whispered, "Remember, baby, you have the blood of everyone Who's ever had to make a stand Who's ever had to find a brand new land And We ain't gonna go the way of the buffalo No, we will not go quietly the way that they want us to be Driven from the only life we've known We ain't gonna go the way of the buffalo And, baby, who knows what's waiting out there? As long as we got each other, baby, I don't care
