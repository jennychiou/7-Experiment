[00:16.94]Whenever you're feeling lonely in our whacking world
[00:24.43]when all the lights go out, your own land starts to blurt
[00:31.97]when everything around you, seem to fall apart
[00:39.71]and all that's left is bare, your feelings start to storm
[00:47.40]Sometimes you're feeling stronger
[00:50.59]sometimes you're feeling weak
[00:54.04]sometimes you're feeling colder
[00:58.10]but the light will bring the heat
