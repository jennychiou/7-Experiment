[00:29.46]Here I am back again.
[00:39.26]And wishing now was then.
[00:48.89]And I could write all the wrongs instead of writing songs.
[01:22.66]It's you I think of now
[01:32.1]And how I push it like a snow plow
[01:41.24]You come racing through my mind
[01:48.89]Was it me or you I left behind?
[02:34.49]You gave me love so pure
[02:43.58]But no love's for sure
[02:53.25]Now I'm not so sure.
