[00:00.42]Magical Lasso - Phantom Of The Opera
[00:03.17]
[00:18.90]Like yellow parchment is his skin ...
[00:22.85]A great black hole served as the nose which never grew ...
[00:30.58]You must be always on your guard,
[00:33.53]Or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
[00:37.70]
[00:44.94]Those who speak of what they know find,
[00:47.63]Too late, that prudent silence is wise.
[00:52.62]Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
[00:55.68]He will burn you with the heat of his eyes!
