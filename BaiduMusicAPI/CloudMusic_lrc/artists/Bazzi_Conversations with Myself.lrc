[00:01.39]Sometimes I wonder why I'm even here
[00:04.01]Or if I have the strength to persevere
[00:06.67]Sometimes I feel like I'm somebody else
[00:08.92]Who's going mental with they mental health
[00:11.54]Sometimes I wonder if I'll die alone
[00:14.11]'Cause lonely people tend to have lonely souls
[00:16.60]Sometimes I think about a younger me
[00:18.99]If he'd be proud of the man he sees
[00:21.44]I guess I'm rich, I made it out my town
[00:23.83]I played in from of thousands, you know I shut it down
[00:26.13]Look, little Bazzi, I'm living out our dreams
[00:28.76]Mama cry every time we on the TV
[00:31.38]Got a fancy car, we got a fancy crib
[00:33.94]And you couldn't even dream of the girl that you with
[00:36.51]Remember all your idols and the people that we love
[00:38.89]I met 'em at a party, we was all doin' drugs
[00:41.68]Was all doin'
[00:42.48]Jesus
[00:44.29]I think I need, I think I need some
[00:47.56]Jesus
[00:49.10]Rich enough and sad as ****
[00:52.18]I'm lonely
[00:54.05]Oh, I am, I am, I am
[00:56.64]I'm so lonely
[00:59.12]I'm the man, I guess I am
[01:01.74]But I'm still
[01:04.72]What's funny is, is
[01:07.04]My whole life I thought making money
[01:09.65]And being praise would give me some kind of happiness
[01:13.86]And I wanted those things because I was concerned About
[01:17.67]What everyone else thought of me
[01:18.99]I wanted to feel loved, I wanted to feel accepted
[01:21.31]And then I realized that I could never feel anybody's pain
[01:24.72]Or their happiness
[01:26.11]I could only feel mine
[01:27.36]In the car, in the house
[01:29.41]And the fame never made me feel anything except separated,
[01:33.23]Intoxicated, and obviously kinda grossed
[01:36.62]Don't get me wrong, nice things are fun,
[01:39.21]I like nice things
[01:40.20]But you just can't base your human value on them
[01:42.93]Because at the end of the day, they don't mean anything
[01:45.72]If I'm not happy, I'm a sad guy in a nice guy
[01:49.18]If I don't have any real friends or family,
[01:52.66]I'm just a lonely guy in a big home, damn
