[00:02.570]Just when I had it all
[00:41.450]Something got the question end
[00:43.140]I knew they're must be more. In the space I was living in
[00:50.190]So you run, still in still
[00:54.300]Promise to right, but you never will
[00:58.050]So strong and so （??） show
[01:00.550]More I love you less I know
[01:03.850]Nobody told me I could fall, I never knew his place at all
[01:10.530]Nobody show the road to take, guess I got lost to look away
[01:17.880]How could I miss the signs ? I looked the truth but I close my eyes
[01:24.680]Everything in my heart, I fall I knew, nobody told me that was you （that was you x3）
[01:34.540]Now I'm gonna trying to forget,
[01:43.280]All the years of emptiness
[01:45.710]I always be living in regrets
[01:49.580]For all the words I never said
[01:51.950]I heard you close as you （??）
[01:55.440]into my heart but out my life
[01:57.940]I couldn't let you go, when you're all I need to know
[02:05.440]Nobody told me I could fall, I never knew his place at all
[02:12.230]Nobody show the road to take, guess I've got luck to look away
[02:19.220]How could I miss the signs ? I looked the truth but I close my eyes
[02:26.020]Everything in my heart, I fall I knew, nobody told me that was you
[02:33.010]Nobody told me that you ever say （no no）
[02:36.630]Nobody told me tell I knew what's too late
[02:48.680]Tell me something I don't know
[02:54.590]Nobody told me that was you
[02:56.290]Nobody told me that was you
[03:00.090]Nobody told me I could fall （nobody no）, I never knew his place at all
[03:38.710]Nobody show the road to take, guess I got lost to look away
[03:41.530]How could I miss the signs ? I looked the truth but I close my eyes
[03:47.330]Everything in my heart, I fall I knew, nobody told me that was you
[03:49.270]Nobody told me, nobody want me, nobody said that will be you （x2）
[03:52.960]Nobody no...
