[00:17.370]Deep in the meadow, under the willow
[00:27.260]A bed of grass, a soft green pillow
[00:35.050]Lay down your head, and close your eyes
[00:44.370]And when they open, the sun will rise.
[01:31.180]Here it's safe, and here it's warm
[01:39.550]Here the daisies guard you from every harm
[01:48.330]Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true
[01:57.680]Here is the place where I love you.
