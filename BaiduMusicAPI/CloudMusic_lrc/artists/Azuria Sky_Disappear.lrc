[00:00.00]
[00:40.73]Now close your eyes
[00:46.36]I'll sing a lullaby
[00:52.88]With silence as my words
[00:59.92]I bid you goodbye
[01:06.20]
[01:34.15]Meet me in the tide
[01:40.65]I'll be in disguise
[01:47.20]And though the years go by
[01:53.78]I'll smile when you arrive
[01:59.77]
[02:59.34]Open your eyes
[03:04.99]And slowly breathe again
[03:12.06]I'll be sure to hide near you
[03:18.92]When I disappear
[03:24.14]
