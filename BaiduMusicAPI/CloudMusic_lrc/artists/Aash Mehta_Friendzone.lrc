[00:22.07]I grab my keys
[00:24.94]Pull out the car
[00:27.73]Find your place driving through the dark
[00:32.90]Throwing rocks from your backyard
[00:38.33]Throwing rocks at your window
[00:43.12]And you play our song
[00:45.96]Till the very end
[00:48.84]I guess this night's when our friendzone ends
[00:53.94]Throwing rocks at your window now
[00:59.40]Throwing rocks you come out
[01:14.01]I want to live life with no regrets
[01:16.60]Sipping on shots of your sweet kiss
[01:19.29]Give me a taste of a good life
[01:21.88]Riding with you straight through the night
[01:24.38]I want to live life with no regrets
[01:27.20]Sipping on shots of your sweet kiss
[01:29.80]Never ever gonna say goodbye
[01:32.57]Sing this tune till the day I die
[01:35.18]I want to live life with no regrets
[01:38.01]Sipping on shots of your sweet kiss
[01:40.40]You and me we'd be infinity
[01:47.06]And you play our song
[01:49.68]Till the very end
[01:52.77]I guess this night's when our friendzone ends
[01:58.10]Throwing rocks at your window now
[02:03.45]Throwing rocks you come out
[02:18.01]I want to live life with no regrets
[02:20.65]Sipping on shots of your sweet kiss
[02:23.24]Give me a taste of a good life
[02:25.97]Riding with you straight through the night
[02:30.56]Rewind
[02:33.33]To that summer night
[02:35.82]We both knew that it wasn't time
[02:41.05]Besides
[02:43.87]It got us here
[02:46.49]Let's get out this friendzone dear
[02:50.20]I want to live life with no regrets
[02:52.61]Sipping on shots of your sweet kiss
[02:55.23]Give me a taste of a good life
[02:57.90]Riding with you straight through the night
[03:00.45]I want to live life with no regrets
[03:03.28]Sipping on shots of your sweet kiss
[03:05.79]You and me we'd be infinity
