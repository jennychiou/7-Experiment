(feat. Yelawolf) [Big Boi] 
Boy stop, you ain't no 
DJ... [*echoes*] ("Greetings...") 
I double dare, matter of fact ****** 
I double dog dare any rapper that take it there with this playa here 
Let's be clear, 
I'm a leader not your peer 
Valedictorian of this rap *******t every year (year year year) 
Like beer and pretzels with the game 
I go good 
I'm the Hansel to your 
Gretel, you's a dame, understood 
Overstand hoe ass ****** from my hood, 
I'm embarrassed by the lack of class, sat in the back of class but passed with flying colors with yo' backwards ass, you're like the caboose 
And I'm the engine locomotive to let loose steam in the booth, scream ah 
WOOF! Dream 
Team, ****** ****** that pillow talk, keep sleeping while 
I'm beating down yo' street up in that green thing 
Greetings 
Earthlings, 
I've been lurking deep in the shadows 
Gathering artillery for the battle 
Now, on the front line 
I stand, microphone in my right hand 
Left foot on the gas, don't make me put my foot in yo' ass [Chorus 2X: Big Boi] 
Yo' DJ ain't no 
DJ, he just make them ****** mixtapes 
Where they at? [*repeat 7X*] 
Yo' DJ ain't no 
DJ, he just hit that instant replay 
There they go [*repeat 7X*] - go [Yelawolf] 
Yeah, my momma gave birth to a 10-pound, 6-ounce dream (Dream dream dream dream dream) 
And God said, look for the burnin bush, now 
I turned to ****** 
So I jumped in my shell when 
I saw my momma burnin trees (hey) 
Hard white, 
I, trickle nickel bags 
Ice cold true *******t; in the booth with blue lips 
On your grave like a tulip, in the bar like a pool stick 8-0-8 
Toomp *******t, 
Magic Mike, poof *******! 
Ain't nowhere to rest, nowhere for you to sit 
I stole your couch and 
I took your truck to move it with 
Sofa, any one of you wanna get to' up? 
I'm a tattoo, 
Kodak you, close up 
Ain't no U
FO, no, Yela's a supernova (WOOF!) 
Dogs are barkin as soon as that trooper roll up (WOOF!) 30 at 6, momma don't gotta load up 
Cause I'm from the varsity of maybe hardly and 
RC Cola Hold up! [Chorus] [Yelawolf] 
Yeah, and, 
I party in poverty with people like, "Yeah you're famous, so what?" 
I bet you can't hitch that semi up to this tow truck 
Rich with a hundred dollars, soul like a batch of collards 
Yeah I'm pale but 
I'll impale you with an 
Impala Roll with pimp scholars, +
ATLiens+ A-
L-A-B-A-M-
A agains, come and check my weight again 
Baby I know 
I ain't that crazy, the scale says heavy 
Must be my ****** the way ******* been hangin on it lately [Big Boi] (Yeah, we stay) bangin on the daily, soul funk crusader maybe 
Tailored alligator soufflÐ¹, 
Escalade all in yo' ladies 
Space invader, 
I'm the lyrical 
Darth Vader 
Give thanks ******* ****** 
I don't expose you as a hater 
Got Decatur, 
East Point, 
College Park and the 
SWAT's Campbellton 
Road closed, road block, watch out for the cops 
Gotta think outside the box, know how to connect the dots '
Fore somebody hit the jackpot playin in ya slot, boy stop [Chorus] [Big Boi] 
Where they at? [*repeat 8X*] 
There they go [*repeat 7X*] - go 
Where they at? [*repeat 7X*] 
There they go [*repeat as it fades out*]
