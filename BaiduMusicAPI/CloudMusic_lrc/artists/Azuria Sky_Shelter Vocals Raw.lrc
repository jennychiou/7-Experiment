[00:01.58]I could never find the right way to tell you
[00:07.33]Have you noticed I've been gone
[00:12.81]Cause I left behind the home that you made me
[00:18.13]But I will carry it along
[00:22.61]It's a long way forward
[00:25.85]So trust in me
[00:28.58]I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
[00:33.42]And I know, I'm not alone
[00:37.98]You'll be watching over us
[00:41.15]Until you're gone
