[00:05.95]To dream the impossible dream
[00:12.30]To fight the unbeatable foe
[00:18.33]To bear with unbearable sorrow
[00:24.56]To run where the brave dare not go.
[00:29.28]
[00:30.87]To right the unrightable wrong
[00:36.75]To love pure and chaste from afar
[00:42.93]To try when your arms are too weary
[00:48.74]To reach the unreachable star
[00:53.47]
[00:54.30]This is my quest, to follow that star,
[00:59.86]No matter how hopeless,
[01:02.22]no matter how far
[01:04.85]To fight for the right
[01:07.55]without question or pause
[01:10.89]To be willing to march
[01:12.61]into hell for heavenly cause
[01:17.50]
[01:18.31]And I know if I'll only be true to
[01:22.95]this glorious quest
[01:27.01]That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
[01:32.21]when I'm laid to my rest
[01:35.62]
[01:39.12]And the world will be better for this
[01:45.35]That one man
[01:47.55]scorned and covered with scars
[01:51.27]Still strove with his last ounce of courage
[01:57.53]To fight the unbeatable foe
[02:03.73]To reach the unreachable star.
