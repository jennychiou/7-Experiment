Setting The Pace When You Walk Through The Door
You're Finding A Place For Your Face On The Floor
Oh, How It Will Turn Out, You Never Can Tell
One Thing's Sure, You're Sure Not Living In Hell
Well, Hellï¿½
The Feeling You Get When You're Running The Game
The Ceiling Has Cameras They Know You By Name
You're Working The Tables And They're Working For You
You're Like An Earthquake Baby, Earthshaker 
It's Easy To Do
Unholy Passion In A Timeless Night
You Came To Win
Who Can Resist The Sin?
In Las Vegas
Las Vegas Yeah Yeah
Oh Well Now, You're Putting Your Feet Up
You're Turning The Heat Up
A High-Stakes Dealer 
With A High-Card Hand Up
You're Letting It Ride 
And Letting It Roll
Let It Roll 
Let It Roll
My Heart Is Pounding In My Chest
I Can't Believe I'm Here
I Cannot Believe It
(I Cannot Believe It)
I Cannot Believe It
(I Cannot Believe It)
I Cannot Believe It
(I Cannot Believe It)
What's Not To Believe In Las Vegas?
Las Vegas, Nevada
Las Vegas, Nevada
Las Vegas, Nevada
1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Well, You're putting your feet up
You're Turning The Heat Up
You're Letting It Ride And
You're Letting It Roll
Las Vegas!
