[00:09.480]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:11.750]So the bar is where I go
[00:14.590]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:16.760]Drinking faster and then we talk slow
[00:19.500]You come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:21.820]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:24.420]Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
[00:26.880]And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
[00:29.580]
