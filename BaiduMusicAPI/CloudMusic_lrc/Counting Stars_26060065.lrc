[00:01.670]Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
[00:04.850]Dreaming about the things that we could be
[00:09.480]But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
[00:13.480]Said no more counting dollars
[00:16.040]We'll be counting stars

[00:37.720]I see this life
[00:39.030]Like a swinging vine
[00:40.340]Swing my heart across the line
[00:42.090]And in my face is flashing signs
[00:43.970]Seek it out and ye' shall find
[00:46.160]Old, but I'm not that old
[00:48.160]Young, but I'm not that bold
[00:49.910]And I don't think the world is sold
[00:51.850]On just doing what we're told
[00:54.440]I-I-I-I feel something so right
[00:58.750]Doing the wrong thing
[01:01.750]I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
[01:06.310]Doing the right thing
[01:09.880]I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie

[01:47.140]We'll be, we'll be counting stars
[01:56.390]I feel the love
[01:57.640]And I feel it burn
[01:59.080]Down this river, every turn
[02:00.950]Hope is our four-letter word
[02:02.950]Make that money
