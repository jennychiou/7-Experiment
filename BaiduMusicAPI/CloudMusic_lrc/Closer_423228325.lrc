[00:10.050]Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
[00:14.480]I drink too much and that's an issue
[00:16.660]But I'm okay
[00:20.120]Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
[00:24.580]But I hope I never see them again
[00:30.950]I know it breaks your heart
[00:32.690]Moved to the city in a broke down car and
[00:36.180]Four years no call
[00:37.810]Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
[00:40.370]I can't stop
[00:45.140]No, I can't stop
[00:50.240]So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
[00:54.940]That I know you can't afford
[00:57.440]Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
[00:59.990]Pull the sheets right off the corner
[01:02.400]Of the mattress that you stole
[01:04.940]From your roommate back in Boulder
[01:07.460]We ain't ever getting older
[01:17.680]We ain't ever getting older
[01:27.580]We ain't ever getting older
[01:30.850]You, look as good as the day I met you
[01:35.340]I forget just why I left you, I was insane
[01:40.820]Stay, and play that Blink-182 song
[01:45.440]That we beat to death in Tucson
[01:47.850]OK
