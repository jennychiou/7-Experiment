[00:09.23]I try to reach you
[00:12.42]I can't hide how strongs of feeling when we dive
[00:18.00]I cross the ocean of my mind
[00:22.58]My wounds are healing with the salt
[00:26.81]All my senses intensify whenever you and I
[00:34.38]We dive across the ocean of my mind
[00:39.53]But in the end I drown
[00:41.78]You push me down,down
[01:44.82]Oh,they said
[01:52.69]When you call my name
[02:01.93]I felt fine
[02:10.98]When you came
