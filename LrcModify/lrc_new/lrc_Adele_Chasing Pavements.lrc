[00:36.160]I've made up my mind
[00:39.640]Don't need to think it over
[00:42.290]If I'm wrong I am right
[00:45.670]Don't need to look no further
[00:46.760]This ain't lust
[00:50.210]I know this is love
[00:57.900]But if I tell the world
[01:02.400]I'll never say enough
[01:04.740]Cos it was not said to you
[01:07.810]And that's exactly what I need to do
[01:11.510]If I end up with you
[01:17.810]Should I give up
[01:19.750]Or should I just keep chasing pavements
[01:23.150]Even if it leads no where,
[01:27.650]Or would it be a waste
[01:29.930]Even if I knew my place should I leave it there.
[01:36.650]Should I give up
[01:39.120]Or should I just keep chasing pavements
[01:43.400]Even if it leads nowhere
[01:51.780]I build myself up
[01:55.510]And fly around in circles
[01:58.130]Waiting as my heart drops
[02:01.160]And my back begins to tingle
[02:04.130]Finally could this be it or
[02:10.880]Should I give up
[02:12.820]Or should I just keep chasing pavements
[02:16.850]Even if it leads nowhere,
[02:21.230]Or would it be a waste
[02:23.600]Even if I knew my place should I leave it there.
[02:30.290]Should I give up
[02:32.230]Or should I just keep chasing pavements
[02:36.320]Even if it leads nowhere
[02:45.400]Should I give up
[02:47.500]Or should I just keep chasing pavements
[02:50.710]Even if it leads nowhere,
[02:56.460]Or would it be a waste
[02:58.900]Even if I knew my place
[03:02.250]Should I leave it there
[03:05.280]Should I give up
[03:08.390]Or should I just keep on chasing pavements
[03:14.550]Should I just keep on chasing pavements
[03:21.500]Or should I give up
[03:26.320]Or should I just keep chasing pavements
[03:30.350]Even if it leads nowhere
[03:34.750]Or would it be a waste
[03:37.110]Even if I knew my place
[03:40.070]Should I leave it there
[03:44.430]Should I give up
[03:46.330]Or should I just keep chasing pavements
[03:50.450]Even if it leads nowhere
