1
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,809
When the days are cold

2
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,498
And the cards all fold

3
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:20,301
And the saints we see

4
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:23,004
Are all made of gold

5
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:25,513
When your dreams all fail

6
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:28,114
And the ones we hail

7
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,705
Are the worst of all

8
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:34,602
And the blood′s run stale

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,409
I wanna hide the truth

10
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,810
I wanna shelter you

11
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:42,501
But with the beast inside

12
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:45,206
There′s nowhere we can hide

13
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,803
No matter what we breed

14
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,508
We still are made of greed

15
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,113
This is my kingdom come

16
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,912
This is my kingdom come

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,799
When you feel my heat

18
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,406
Look into my eyes

19
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:04,005
It is where my demons hide

20
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:06,616
It is where my demons hide

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,209
Don′t get too close

22
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:11,904
It is dark inside

23
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:14,501
It is where my demons hide

24
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,606
It is where my demons hide

25
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:18,807
At the curtains call

26
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,004
It is the last of all

27
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,807
When the lights fade out

28
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:26,514
All the sinners crawl

29
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:29,503
So they dug your grave

30
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,100
And the masquerade

31
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:34,717
Will come calling out

32
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:38,902
At the mess You have made

33
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,517
Don′t wanna let you down

34
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:43,916
But I am‚ hell bound

35
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:46,505
Though this is all for you

36
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,310
Don′t wanna hide the truth

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,699
No matter what we breed

38
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:54,414
We still are made of greed

39
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,113
This is my kingdom come

40
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,598
This is my kingdom come

41
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:02,803
When you feel my heat

42
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,412
Look into my eyes

43
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:08,013
It is where my demons hide

44
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:10,602
It is where my demons hide

45
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:13,417
Don′t get too close

46
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:16,112
It is dark inside

47
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,599
It is where my demons hide

48
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,504
It is where my demons hide

49
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:23,913
They say It is what you make

50
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:26,400
I say It is up to fate

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,199
It is woven in my soul

52
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,814
I need to let you go

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,499
Your eyes‚ they shine so bright

54
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:37,114
I wanna save that light

55
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:39,813
I can′t escape this now

56
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,004
Unless you show me how

57
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,415
When you feel my heat

58
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,114
Look into my eyes

59
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,615
It is where my demons hide

60
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:53,208
It is where my demons hide

61
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:56,007
Don′t get too close

62
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,708
It is dark inside

63
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,317
It is where my demons hide

64
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:06,508
It is where my demons hide

65
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:16,513
