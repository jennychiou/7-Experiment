[00:01.67]When the days are cold
[00:04.36]And the cards all fold
[00:07.06]And the saints we see
[00:09.87]Are all made of gold
[00:12.58]When your dreams all fail
[00:15.08]And the ones we hail
[00:17.67]Are the worst of all
[00:20.27]And the blood's run stale
[00:24.17]I wanna hide the truth
[00:26.97]I wanna shelter you
[00:29.36]But with the beast inside
[00:32.07]There's nowhere we can hide
[00:34.77]No matter what we breed
[00:37.37]We still are made of greed
[00:40.08]This is my kingdom come
[00:42.68]This is my kingdom come
[00:45.46]When you feel my heat
[00:48.37]Look into my eyes
[00:50.97]It is where my demons hide
[00:53.58]It is where my demons hide
[00:56.17]Don't get too close
[00:58.77]It is dark inside
[01:01.46]It is where my demons hide
[01:04.07]It is where my demons hide
[01:07.17]At the curtains call
[01:07.97]It is the last of all
[01:10.57]When the lights fade out
[01:13.38]All the sinners crawl
[01:16.07]So they dug your grave
[01:19.06]And the masquerade
[01:21.68]Will come calling out
[01:24.27]At the mess You have made
[01:28.48]Don't wanna let you down
[01:31.08]But I am‚ hell bound
[01:33.47]Though this is all for you
[01:36.07]Don't wanna hide the truth
[01:38.86]No matter what we breed
[01:41.28]We still are made of greed
[01:43.98]This is my kingdom come
[01:46.66]This is my kingdom come
[01:50.17]When you feel my heat
[01:52.38]Look into my eyes
[01:54.98]It is where my demons hide

[02:18.78]I need to let you go
[02:21.36]Your eyes‚ they shine so bright
[02:24.08]I wanna save that light
[02:26.68]I can't escape this now
[02:29.37]Unless you show me how
[02:32.58]When you feel my heat
