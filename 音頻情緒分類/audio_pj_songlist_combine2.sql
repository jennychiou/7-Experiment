dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate\nAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate.He woke up; the room was bare.\nHe didn|t see her anywhere.\nHe told himself he didn|t care; pushed the window open wide;\nFelt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate\nBrought on by a simple twist of fate.He hears the ticking of the clocks\nAnd walks along with a parrot that talks.\nHunts her down by the waterfront docks\nWhere the sailors all come in.\nMaybe she|ll pick him out again. How long must he wait\nOne more time for a simple twist of fate.People tell me it|s a sin\nTo know and feel too much within.\nI still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.\nShe was born in

something colorful\nAnd if it|s crazy, live a little crazy\nYou can play it sensible, a king of conventional\nOr you can risk it all and see\nDon|t you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play\n|Cause I got what you need\nSo come with me and take the ride\nIt|ll take you to the other side\n|Cause you can do like you do\nOr you can do like me\nStay in the cage, or you|ll finally take the key\nOh, there, suddenly you|re free to fly\nIt|ll take you to the other side\nOkay, my friend, you want to cut me in\nWell I hate to tell you, but it just won|t happen\nSo thanks, but no\nI think I|m good to go\n|Cause I quite enjoy the life, you say I|m trapped in\nNow I admire you, and that whole show you do\nYou|re onto something, really it|s something\nBut I live among the swells and we don|t pick up peanut shells\nI|ll have to leave that up to you\nDon|t you know that I|m okay with this uptown part I get to play\n|Cause I got what I need and I don|t want to take the ride\nI don|t need to see the other side\nSo go and do like you do\nI|m good to do like me\nAin|t in a cage, so I don|t need to take the key\nOh, there, can|t you see I|m doing fine\nI don|t need to see the other side\nIs this really how you like to spend your days\nWhiskey, misery, and parties you place\nIf I were mixed up with you, I|d be the talk of the town\nDisgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns\nBut you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little\nJust let me give you the freedom to dream a little\nWake you up and cure your aching\nTake your walls and start unbreaking\nNow that|s a deal, that seems worth taking\nBut I guess I|ll leave that up to you\nWell it|s intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly\nSo what percentage of the show would I be taking\nFair enough, you|d want a piece of all the action\nI|d give you seven, we could shake and make it happen\nI wasn|t born this morning, eighteen would be just fine\nWhy not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime\nFifteen\nI|d do eight\nTwelve\nMaybe nine\nTen\nDon|t you wanna get away to a whole new part you|re gonna play\n|Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride\nTo the other

pout with no regrets\nYeah I|m sorry too, but sorry ain|t cutting it\n\nI|ve given all my love, just to watch you waste away\nThere|s nothing left to say to you, I can|t take this anymore\nI|ve given all I am, but know it|s time to let it go,\nI|m moving on, there|s nothing left to say.\n\nEvery time I try to hold you close, you slide back over to him\nLeaving me with nothing but the hope, that this would be the end\nSuddenly I|d be dragged back into the mess that we called our love\nYour kisses don|t impress, so take your crazy ways |cause I ain|t having it.\n\nI|ve given all my love, just to watch you waste away\nThere|s nothing left to say to you, I can|t take this anymore\nI|ve given all my love\n\nI gave you the best of me, and then you took it and threw it all away.\nI|ve played your fool for so long, but now that|s over\nI|ve moved on, I got better things to do, and then you.\n\nWalk On, Walk On, Walk On, I never want to see you again.\nWalk On, Walk On, Walk On, I never
