And let yourself go blue for once And let go of the weight you've been carrying In this house no one goes to sleep for days It's like were working on a mountainside Trying not to slide Into the ocean  I can take care of you But only if you want I'm strong enough to carry you Across the icy lake, across the icy lake But I can't fight your blues 'Cause I know I'll lose What's left of my mind I can't win But for you I will try Oh, my baby blue  My mountain is hidden in a pile of trees And she's the one I'll have to climb If I ever wanna see Blue sky when you gonna learn to rain?

sad_all/Brightly.mp3,Sleeping At Last,Brightly,"So close, Yet barely breathing, My responses are weak.  Though my eyes are shut tightly. May I see you brightly.  Handshakes and fake smiles Always make me nervous... Close the door, Plaease, close the door.  We rise and fall From you. Climb, climb, climb... We fall.  May w learn from The signals of our past, The sharpest words we cast And begin again.  I can hear their voices Through the walls of this place... This cold, cold place We rise and fall from you, We rise and fall far from you.  So close, Yet barely breathing, My responses are weak.  Trace these fingerprints, closely now And they will form what you're looking for. We'll make new prints once more."

sad_all/Caving in.mp3,Kimya Dawson,Caving In,"Have you ever been swindled by a swindler who lies 'Cause he wants to see you smile, have a good time, be inspired And he doesn't want for you to cry or know he cries inside So he hides behind his great triumphant rock and roll disguise We want things to be real but you really can't deny We feel excited and on fire is it wrong to lie and say he's fine When the reason he's not fine is the pressure of the power changing lives In just one hour all these people will be better people  Take this job and shove it, adios I'm a ghost I am leaving for the coast and I'll never work for anyone again I am not your savior or your heavenly host I'm just a piece of zwieback toast Getting soggy in a baby's achin' mouth I'm going south like the geese I just goosed you and so maybe I seem loose to you But I don't even want to spoon And I did once But I don't now Now that I see how you do things The way you play and sing's amazing But the way you play the game is crazy You don't have to say you're sorry, you don't owe me anything Don't owe me anything  Sometimes it seems like I've got all the answers But the answers aren't the same when the questions keep on changing Like how will I react when I see my mother crying Avery single day 'cause she is afraid of dying? And how will I contain my anger When Delila plays Unchained Melody instead of Lost In Your Eyes? And where will I go where I can feel safe When my family sells its place and we all split up and move away?  I'm trying to be brave 'cause when I'm brave Other people feel brave But I feel like my heart is caving in  I'm trying to be brave 'cause when I'm brave Other people feel brave But I feel like my heart is caving in  I'm trying to be brave 'cause when I'm brave Other people feel brave But I feel like my heart is caving in"
sad_all/Clothes Of Sand.mp3,Nick Drake,Clothes Of Sand,Who has dressed you in strange clothes of sand Who has taken you far from my land Who has said that my sayings were wrong And who will say that I stayed much too long?  Clothes of sand have covered yor face Given you meaning but taken my place So make your way on down to the sea Something has taken you so far from me.  Does it now seem worth all the colour of skies To see the earth through painted eyes To look through panes of shaded glass See the stains of winter's grass.  Can you now return to from where you came Try to burn your changing name Or with silver spoons and coloured light Will you worship moons in winter's night.  Clothes of sand have covered your face Given you meaning but taken my place So make your way on down to the sea Something has taken you so far from me.
sad_all/Colors And The Kids.mp3,Cat Power,Colors And The Kids,It must be the colors And the kids That keep me alive 'Cause the music is boring me to death  It must just be the colors And the kids that keep me alive 'Cause I wanna go ride away To a January night Built a shack with an old friend He was someone I could learn from Someone I could become  Will you meet me down On a sandy beach We can roll up our jeans So the tide won't get us below the knees  Yellow hair You are a funny bear Yellow hair You are such a funny bear Slender fingers Would hold me slender limbs would hold me And you could say my name Like you knew my name  I could stay here Become someone different I could stay here Become someone better  It's so hard to go in the city 'Cause you wanna say hello to everybody It's so hard to go into the city 'Cause you wanna say hey I love you to everybody When we were teenagers we wanted to be the sky Now all we wanna do is go to red places And try to stay outta hell  It must be the colors And the kids That keep me alive 'Cause the music is boring me to death  It must just be the colors And it must just be the kids That keep me alive on this January night.

Right now I'm hurt, and I don't understand. Lets just be quiet, and later we can talk. Please stay, don't worry. I'll walk.  I held her hand through everything. The weeks and months of therapy. And I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride. She's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle. So from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles.  And says, I'll walk. Please hold my hand. I know that this will hurt, I know you understand. Please daddy don't cry. This is already hard. Let's go, don't worry. I'll walk."

And life went on beyond the palisades, They all bought bright cadillacs- And left there long ago.  We held a concert out in brooklyn- To watch the island bridges blow. They turned our power down, And drove us underground- But we went right on with the show...  I've seen the lights go out on broadway- I saw the ruins at my feet, You know we almost didn't notice it- We'd see it all the time on forty-second street.  They burned the churches up in harlem- Like in that Spanish civil war- The flames were everywhere, But no one really cared- It always burned up there before...  I saw the lights go out on broadway- I watched the mighty skyline fall. The boats were waiting at the battery, The union went on strike- They never sailed at all.  They sent a carrier out from norfolk- And picked the yankees up for free. They said that queens could stay, They blew the bronx away- And sank manhattan out to sea...  You know those lights were bright on broadway- But that was so many years ago... Before we all lived here in florida- Before the mafia took over Mexico. There are not many who remember- They say a handful still survive... To tell the world about... The way the lights went out, And keep the memory alive..."

How weak you must feel As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed But I won't march again on your battlefield And he took her to the window to see  And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray And she wanted more than she ever could say But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away And would not look at his face again  And he said: ""I want to live as an honest man To get all I deserve and to give all I can And to love a young woman who I don't understand Your highness, your ways are very strange""  But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait She would only be a moment inside  Out in the distance her order was heard And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word And while the queen went on strangling in the Solitude she preferred The battle continued on"

My life is scattered in the wind I'm trying to begin again Where did you go I just don't know? I don't wanna cry myself to sleep again I don't wanna wake up all alone again  I've never been dealt a hand like this With face cards running dry And rain falling out of the sky What could have been if you had stayed Broken dreams would mend You'd be sitting in the summer wind with me  But all I've got are memories And dreams of how my life could be Dreams of how my life could be.-&gt;

sad_all/Your Cape.mp3,Breathe Owl Breathe,Your Cape,"How do you think that made me feel inside? It's inside of me... It's inside you too... So I should know. They called me the same names they called you When you were young... You were scared of the dark; They had to walk you out to the bus stop. And in class you were quiet and shy, But inside you had a question to ask...  Do you know we held hands... At least I know that I held yours. And I've got a lot on my mind, But I can't always find the words.  I skinned my knee, And it started bleeding. There's a war out on the playground That the parents don't see; Children taking sides, And it's you I need to see. You're the one with the cape on that's billowing.  Do you know we held hands... At least I know I held yours. And I've got a lot on my mind, But I can't always find the words.  You do need to leave. You need to trust me. How can we leave it Better off than it was When we're fighting? And no it's not getting easier Even though it's what we need...  Do you know we held hands... At least I know I held yours. And I've got a lot on my mind, But I can't always find the words."
