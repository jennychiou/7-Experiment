happy_all/Be Gentle With Me.mp3,The Boy Least Likely To,Be Gentle With Me,"Staring up into the solar system, All the stars are fixed up in the sky. I just want to sparkle for a moment Before I just fizzle out and die. I'm happy because I'm stupid. Scared of spiders, scared of flying. If I wasn't so happy, I wouldn't be so scared of dying. So just be gentle with me (I'm not as young as I was) And I'll be gentle with you I'm not as brave as I thought 'Cause my heart gets broken so easily. So just be gentle, be gentle with me. Wide awake, waiting like a target Listening for things I cannot see. Insects flutter up against my window. I don't like the way they look at me I guess I've always needed To be needed by someone. It's a comforting feeling Being under someone's thumb. So just be gentle with me (And if I am ever mean) And I'll be gentle with you I never mean to be mean 'Cause I want to pick peaches off of a cherry tree. Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, Be gentle with me. So just be gentle with me Trouble is sometimes And I'll be gentle with you I just can't switch myself off When I want to so I never do Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle, Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle And I'll be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with you."

And now you find you fit this identikit completely You say you have no secrets Then leave discreetly  I might make it California's fault Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault Just like the canals of Mars and the great barrier reef I come to you beyond belief  My hands were clammy and cunning She's been suitably stunning But I know there's not a hope in Hades  All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle So-called gentlemen and ladies Dogfight like rose and thistle  I've got a feeling I'm going to get a lot of grief Once this seemed so appealing Now I am beyond belief  I've got a feeling I'm going to get a lot of grief Once this seemed so appealing Now I am beyond belief  I've got a feeling I'm going to get a lot of grief Once this seemed so appealing Now I am beyond belief  I've got a feeling"

And I won't get used To being alone.  Under a full moon, Hopelessly trying to Retrace our footsteps in the snow. I don't know when to hang on And when to let go.  Foxes in boxes, And butterfly blues. From little acorns you... You quietly made me... Made me into you.  Holding it under My tongue till it stings. From all of my demons You quietly saved me Again and again.  But now I feel And surface again. Yes, I can feel And surface again.  From little bubbles, Little air bubbles, Little embolysms grow. I don't know to hang on. Everything I feel feels wrong. I don't know when to hang on And when to let go."

He'll only bring you souvenirs It's only gonna end in tears And he is only the imposter
