I\'m the one who eases blood pressure and eliminates stress Yet doctors work against me And even though they (tried the best one?) Rest assured that I\'ll inevitably triumph over their attempts It\'s feeble \'Cause they don\'t understand that their temps have one day been granted What they\'ve planted will remain, it\'s a cycle Just like the rain I step in time with today It falls with the sole purpose of washing all your tears away  (Verse 2: Alias) As I stroll silently amongst the shadows I see that I\'m between nothingness and eternity I\'m the last one you see before your journey And the one who releases answers to your uncertainty Some wish to seek shelter from the rain Thinking they would be avoided by me and my glances inside their brain Look past (hail) thoughts and the occasional tumor To understand how you truly feel How will I approach this case? Thought to self: Look on face for any signs of anxiousness Unhappy with life style i.e. armloads of thanklessness And it is this that gives me my direction Of what they seek My open arms of protection Are waiting for the innocent and meek To come towards me and say \"Let me hear your voice\" At that point there\'s no looking back This is when your soul comes undone And you and your creator once again become one For I will talk about how they have led a fulfilling life, in fact That\'s when they react With a deep exhale Close their eyes, then turn pale Brief, for I\'ve taken their hand And taken them through their life In a three-second span Decisions, decisions Should I stay or should I go? Coming with me right now would mean... Absolutely nothing (at all/atoll/a toll?)

Boys were sighing, their girlfriends crying, hearts were pounding when; The Big Noise dances, hence romances, it\'s just astounding when; Big Noise blew in from Winnetka, Big Noise blew right out again.  Stop! Look! Listen! Listen to the Big Noise. Stop! Look! Listen! Listen to the Big Noise.  I am the one they call the Big Noise. I got to dance my way to fame. I just blew in from Winnetka, that town will never be the same. Now I had my fun, and yet there\'s just one who\'s got me from the start. I\'d love to conga a little bit longer but it keeps us apart. Exit Big Noise from Winnetka, enter Big Noise in his heart.  Big men move me out. Senors zonk me out. Zim zom zup ma ma. Big men boo bop ba, bah ba doo wop. Boodeeah baby boodeeah baby boodeeah baby. Boodeeah baby boodeeah baby boodeeah baby baby baby over \'n\' out.  She loves the bass. She loves the drum. She loves to stay out late and dance the samba, samba, how she loves to samba, Rhumba, salsa, limbo and pachenga. She\'s so restless she\'s on every guest list. None can please her. She\'d say no to Ceaser. Teach me, why don\'t you teach me. Show me how to let go!  There she goes \'round again, up and then down again, in and then out. Hoo!  When Big Noise waltzes through the door the bouncer has to clear the floor, \'Cause everybody wants to see the girl get down, the girl get down. And if you try to hold me tight, I\'ll disappear into the night. My lover\'s waiting home for me (she don\'t do that! She don\'t do that!)  Everyone\'s got a bit of Big Noise in his heart, Everyone likes to toot his horn. I\'ve been the Big Noise from Winnetka for so long, Time for a new noise to be born. \'Cause I had my fun and et there\'s just one who\'s got me from the start. Exit Big Noise for Winnetka, enter Big Noise in my heart.  Onc she was pickin\' up the big boys ... Now I\'m pickin\' up my little kids\' toys ... Big Noise we miss you.', ''),
