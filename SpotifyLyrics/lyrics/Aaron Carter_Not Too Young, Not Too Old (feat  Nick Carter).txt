I'm not too young and I'm not too old

Listen up everybody
This ain't Aaron's party
Par to a 2 come and show me body
Girl, whatcha gonna do
Come and talk to me in the backseat
Baby backstreet

We could surf the board
Surf the net, better yet,
We could make a little bet
If we get together, yo, it's gonna be da bomb
Hit me all baby, Aaron Carter dot com

See when it comes to girls
I'm not too young
Baby take back up on the seat
But when I get in trouble
Hey, I'm not so old
I put my cap way down
And say I'm seven-years-old
That's how we roll

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old

It's A to the A to the R O N
I'm all growin' up now
Runnin' to your friend
It's all TO COOL
Where do I begin?
Don't even playa hate
Tryin' to say I look ten
I'm not tellin' you again

I'm ON THE radio, kiss me in the studio
That's my life bro. It's in my blood
Hey, it ain't my fault
You wanna step to me
We can take it to the ashfault
Shoot some hoops
Slam dunk the funk
Battle on the rollerblades
You're callin' me a punk

Bring on the skateboards
Or the BMX. Show me what you got
Is that all? Please, next
?????
Where's the concentration
Don't even talk about the Sony Playstation
I'll make it happen if it seems that you won
Aaron Carter ???
This is how we roll



Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old

He's been out with the older boys
Cover up your ears 'cause we're makin' that noise
He's been out with the younger girls
Cover up your eyes 'cause we rock the world

He's been out with the older boys
Cover up your ears 'cause we're makin' that noise
He's been out with the younger girls
Cover up your eyes 'cause we rock the world

When it comes to pickin'
All the girls were cruisin'
Am I right? All I need is ???
Hello. I'm not too young
?????
Switch it off, yo
Hit me on the pager
A real teenager, with a fake beard
Battin' in the majors

That's how we roll
And when it suits me
I'm inbetween 12 and 18-years-old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old
