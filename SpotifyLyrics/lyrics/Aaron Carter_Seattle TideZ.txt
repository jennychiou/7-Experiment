Ain't trying to talk about love, ain't trying to talk about lust
Even though these sands of time won't let me let you go
This current ain't for us, pulling all our trust
Riding waves, ain't tryna let you go

This love can't keep me waiting, this love is far from faded
I see this jaded situation through these sheets of rain and
You always keep me waiting, love's kind and I ain't patient

Seattle tides
Seattle tides
This storm isn't letting up
The current's too strong for us
All that I need is you
It's pulling me out too far, now all I got left is stars

Seattle tides
Seattle tides
So say goodbye to this oceanside
Just wait till I
Seattle tides
No love can rise
Just say goodbye
Love pulling

That moon is losing its touch
Trying to see the light, it's nowhere in the sky tonight (tonight)
We riding on them boards

This love can't keep me waiting, this love is far from faded
I see this jaded situation through these sheets of rain and
You always keep me waiting, love's kind and I ain't patient

Seattle tides
Seattle tides
This storm isn't letting up
The current's too strong for us
All that I need is you
It's pulling me out too far, now all I got left is stars

Seattle tides
Seattle tides
So say goodbye to this oceanside
Just wait till I
Seattle tides
No love can rise
Just say goodbye
Love pulling
