It's taken time, for me to find
That the one true path was right before my eyes
Oh was I blind, not to see
That you're really something you were made for me

And who can tell me baby
The reason or the rhyme
You've got me hooked
You get me every time

Didn't you know you're the best thing
Have I ever told you
You fill my soul
You make it right
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
You put the light into my life

I never hoped to understand
Thought to love someone was a dreamer's hand
I found it all a mystery
But you made me give so very easily
And when I'm with you baby
I fall into your arms
What man alive
Could resist your charms

Didn't you know you're the best thing
Have I ever told you
You fill my soul
You make it right
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
You put the light into my life

Didn't you know you're the best thing
Have I ever told you
You fill my soul
You make it right
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
You put the light into my life

Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't you know you're the best thing

And who can tell me baby
The reason or the rhyme
You've got me hooked
You get me every time

Didn't you know you're the best thing
Have I ever told you
You fill my soul
You make it right
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
You put the light into my life
