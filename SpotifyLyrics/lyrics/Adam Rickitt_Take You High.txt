Wanna take you (x16)
Is there something on your mind?
'Cause you don't seem yourself at all
Is it so hard to find your smile?
When you're all alone
And the nights seem way too long
Just don't hesitate to call

Gotta open up your heart
Love will make a start
Help you leave the past behind
Let me show you, let me lead you to the stars

Oh-oh-oh-oh I wanna take you high
I can give you wings to fly
So high, so high
Oh-oh-oh-oh I wanna take you high
Baby we can touch the sky
So high, so high

Can I get close to you
I wanna lay down by your side
Show you how I really feel
Oh why have we got to lose?
Don't have my love pass you by
Know that this time is for real

Gotta open up your heart
Love will make a start
Help you leave the past behind
Let me show you, let me lead you to the stars

Oh-oh-oh-oh I wanna take you high
I can give you wings to fly
So high, so high
Oh-oh-oh-oh I wanna take you high
Baby we can touch the sky
So high, so high

Wanna take you high (x9)

Gotta open up your heart
Love will make a start
Help you leave the past behind
Let me show you, let me lead you to the stars

Oh-oh-oh-oh I wanna take you high
I can give you wings to fly
So high, so high
Oh-oh-oh-oh I wanna take you high
Baby we can touch the sky
So high, so high
