Some say
I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew

I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you've left behind

Wake me up
Wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified
I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb? 
I won't forgive me if I give up trying

I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I am willing to take the risk

There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart, then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust, but nothing will ever taint us

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I am willing to take the risk

Will he
Will he still remember me? 
Will he still love me even when he's free? 
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me? 

When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
I'll be home so soon, I won't be late

He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
He's willing to take the risk

So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
We're willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk
