I'm living my patience and my motivation
I put them on separate teams
Maybe I found someone I really need?
Well, baby, you with it or not
Not important, 'cause what you do to me
You help me find my sense of urgency
And time flies
I wish I would have met with someone psychic
'Cause my, my, it took some time for me to realize it

Cause today is yesterday's tomorrow
Why take any longer, the feeling's getting stronger
No, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Cause today is yesterday's tomorrow
I ain't Nostradamus, but the future is upon us
No, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Anymore, yeah

I know that you're hoping that this is The Notebook
But baby as you will see
Mr. Gosling ain't got nothing on me
Like oh when alley, when Harry Met Sally
We knew this'd have to be
The kind of love that lasts eternally

And I know that some will say that it could end in heartbreak
But my dear, you only fear the chances that we don't take

Cause today is yesterday's tomorrow
Why take any longer, the feeling's getting stronger
No, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Cause today is yesterday's tomorrow
I ain't Nostradamus, but the future is upon us
No, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Anymore, yeah

Don't let it pass babe
'Cause the future comes fast yeah

Cause today is yesterday's tomorrow
Why take any longer longer, the feeling's getting stronger
No, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Cause today is yesterday's tomorrow
I ain't Nostradamus, but the future is upon us
No, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Anymore, yeah

Today is yesterday's tomorrow
Why take any longer
Why take longer, the feeling's getting stronger
Whoa yeah
