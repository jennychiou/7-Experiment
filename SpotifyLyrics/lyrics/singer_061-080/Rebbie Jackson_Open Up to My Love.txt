I've seen love make strong men weak
Seen love's wounds cut hard and deep
Love can lift you up, it can break you down
Swore it'd never make me a silly clown

Baby, there's magic in your touch
And I'm not the kind that gives up much
My hands sweat and my knees knock
Like an addict I can't stop
Gonna open up my love for you, oh, baby
Gonna open up and let you see the real me
Gonna open up my love for you, ooh, darling
Gonna open up and let you see the real me

'Cause I'm a stranger in your world
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But familiar I've become
My heart's been like a stone
This stone now has a heartbeat
My heart's always been cold
But your love gave my heart heat

Baby, there's magic in your touch
And I'm not the kind that gives up much
My hands sweat and my knees knock
Like an addict I can't stop
Gonna open up my love for you, whoa, baby
Gonna open up and let you see the real me
Gonna open up my love for you, whoa, baby
Gonna open up and let you see the real me

(Oh, baby, oh, darling)
Oh, baby, oh, darling
Just for you (just for you)
Just for you (just for you)
Whoa, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Baby, there's magic in your touch
And I'm not the kind that gives up much
My hands sweat and my knees knock
Like an addict I can't stop
Gonna open up my love for you
Gonna open up and let you see the real me
Gonna open up my love for you
I'm gonna open up for you
Gonna open up and let you see the real me

(I'm gonna open up my love)
(And let you see what I'm made of)
Whoa, baby
(I'm gonna open up my love)
(And let you see what I'm made of)
I'm gonna open open up for now, now

Gonna open up my for you, oh, baby...
