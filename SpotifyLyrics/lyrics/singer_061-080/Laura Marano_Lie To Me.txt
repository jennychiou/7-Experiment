If we lie, I don't mind us being liars
You and I got everything they don't
Through a while, while we're drowning undercovers
Some time, pretending I am yours

Maybe you can stay a little longer
Breaks my heart how I, I don't know better
When you call me naive
But I ain't gonna leave ya
Stay with me, just stay

Want you to lead me on
Leave through the night and dawn
I get out of my head for a minute, out of my head
Want you to lead me on
Can't call it what we want
I get out of my head for a minute, out of my head

Just lie to me
Lie to me
As long as you're doing it good
Just lie to me
Lie to me
Lie

What I need, put words all on my body
Let me read, the tension of your lips
Of the way we fool each other
And the fact that I'm not bothered
When you speak, babe I don't want you to quit

Maybe you can stay a little longer
Breaks my heart how I, I don't know better
When you call me naive
But I ain't gonna leave ya
Stay with me, just stay

Want you to lead me on
Leave through the night and dawn
I get out of my head for a minute, out of my head
Want you to lead me on
Can't call it what we want
I get out of my head for a minute, out of my head

Just lie to me
Lie to me
As long as you're doing it good
Just lie to me
Lie to me
I'll believe every word
Just lie to me
Lie to me
As long as you're doing it good
Just lie to me
Lie to me
Lie

Usually overthink what's said
Repeat it on and on again
But this time, I don't mind, not argue with my mind
This time, I'll take the lies
So I get out of my head for a minute, out of my head
Out of my head for a minute, out of my head
Just lie to me
Lie to me
As long as you're doing it good
Just lie to me
Lie with me
Lie

Want you to lead me on
Leave through the night and dawn
I get out of my head for a minute, out of my head
Want you to lead me on
Can't call it what we want
I get out of my head for a minute, out of my head

Just lie to me
Lie to me
As long as you're doing it good
Just lie to me
Lie to me
I'll believe every word
Just lie to me
Lie to me
As long as you're doing it good
Just lie to me
Lie to me
Lie
