I feel you all around me
Though you're no more in this space
You're nowhere to be found
There's not a breath of you in here

Leaving us behind
I just can't do it all the way
And Nothing can describe
The feeling of dancing with this pain

I toss and turn and then
I roll on your side of the bed
I touch your absent face
No tear will ever bring you back

I'm broken inside
And I wish I could go where you went
I'll fall asleep until I see you
At the other end.
How can I stand alive with only half a life?
How can I love so hard with only half a heart?
Where do I go from here?
How do I breath in here?
I guess it must be true
I am intoxicated by
You...

I try to store away
Pictures and little souvenirs
I found a tone to say I'll be okay
Look, I'm still here

Lying is my way
To keep these feet walking around
While my soul instead
Has found a way to reach your ground

How can I stand alive with only half a life?
How can I love so hard with only half a heart?
Where do I go from here?
How do I breath in here?
I guess it must be true
I am intoxicated by
You...
By you...

I guess it must be true
I am intoxicated by...

How can I stand alive with only half a life?
How can I love so hard with only half a heart?
Where do I go from here?
How do I breath in here?
I guess it must be true
I am intoxicated
By you...

I am intoxicated
Intoxicated
By...
You...
