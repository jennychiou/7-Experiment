I love seeing you happy
I miss seeing that smile
It's been such a long time
And although I don't have you
I know now that I need to
And somehow make you mine
And I won't lie
It's hard seeing you with him
'Cause I know he can't hold you like I can

Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
Till then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours

I remember the love song
I sang every word wrong
But you didn't mind
No, no
And I'll admit that I miss you
But only if you do
'Cause you know that I'm shy
And I can't lie
It's hard seeing you with her
'Cause I know she can't love you like I can

Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
Till then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours

And my love then what's for you then
We got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm forever only yours
Not need to complicate it
A smile is worth the waiting
I'm forever only yours

Someday maybe
Someday maybe
Someday maybe I'll be yours

Someday maybe
Someday maybe
Someday maybe I'll be yours

Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
Till then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours

And my love then what's for you then
We got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm forever only yours
Not need to complicate it
A smile is worth the waiting
I'm forever only yours

I'm forever only yours

I'm forever only yours...
