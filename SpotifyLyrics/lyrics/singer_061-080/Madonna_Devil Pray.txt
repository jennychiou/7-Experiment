Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away

I've been swimming in the ocean
Till I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah, we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

"(Who'll save my soul, save my soul, save my)"
Devil's here to fool ya
"(Who'll save my soul, save my soul, save my)"
Devil's here to fool ya

Who'll save us, who'll save us, who'll save us
Devil's here to fool ya
Who'll save us, who'll save us, who'll save us
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary can't you help me
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away

The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah, we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

Ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

Sing hallelujah
Until my story's told
