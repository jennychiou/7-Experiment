I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me
It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause you're the one

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
Makes me want to pray,
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me want to pray.

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved mmm-mmm
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray

I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel so moved
Makes me want to pray, (But I feel so moved)
Pray you'll always be here (mmm-mmm)
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray (makes me wanna...)

Pray!

I'm not religious
(I'm not religious)
But it makes me wanna pray-ah-ah
(But I feel so moved, mmmm-mmm)
(Makes me wanna pray-a-ah)

I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But it make makes me wanna pray
(Makes me wanna pray!)
(Makes me wanna pray-ah-ah)

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved, mmm, mmm
(Makes me wanna pray-ah-ah)
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray!
(Makes me wanna...)

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
