All I do is dream of you the whole night through
With the dawn I still go on dreaming of you
You're every thought you're everything you're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, (scat) and spring

And were there more than 24 hours in a day
That'd be spent in sweet content, just dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night-time too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

(Big band)

When skies are grey, even when there blue

And were there more than 24 hours in a day
Oh that'd be spent in sweet content... dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
In the Morning, (night-time too)
All I do the whole day through is dream... (I'm dreaming, dreaming a dream) of (just dreaming dreaming a little dream) you...
