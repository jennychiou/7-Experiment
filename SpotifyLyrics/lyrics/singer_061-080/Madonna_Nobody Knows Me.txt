I've
Had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died

I'm
Not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a set-up, until you're fed up

This
World is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

I
I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup, until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup
And I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I
I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try (don't lie)
To improve my life

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me (it's no fun, but the damage is done)
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me (don't want your social disease)
Like, like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me (don't want your social disease)
Like you know me
Like you know me

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time (don't want your social disease)
Won't read a magazine
