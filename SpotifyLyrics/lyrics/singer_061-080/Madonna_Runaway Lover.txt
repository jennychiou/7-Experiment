Written by Madonna and William Orbit

You lost your reputation on a woman
You didn't understand or care to know
You get your education from your lovers
But now there's just no place for you to go

It doesn't pay
To be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay
To give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

You're set adrift with no direction
Just like a ship that's lost at sea
You don't care where you drop your anchor
Make sure it doesn't land on me

(Chorus, repeat)

Walking around on a cloud
'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do

Don't give it away

(Chorus, repeat)

Walking around on a cloud
'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do

It doesn't pay
It doesn't pay
It doesn't pay
To give your heart away
To a runaway lover

Uh uh, no way
Don't give it away
Uh uh, no way
