Did I ever tell you how you live in me
Every waking moment, even in my dreams
And if all this talk is crazy
And you don't know what I mean
Does it really matter, just as long as I believe

I will love again, though my heart is breaking
I will love again, stronger than before
I will love again, even if it takes a lifetime to get over you,
Heaven only knows
I will love again

People never tell you the way they truly feel
I would die for you gladly, if I knew it was for real
So if all this talk sounds crazy
And the words don't come out right
Does it really matter, if it gets me through this night

If I'm true to myself
Nobody else can take the place of you
But I've got to move on
Tell me what else can I do

I will love again...
I will love again...
I will love again...
One day I know I will love again
You can't stop me from loving again
Breathing again
Feeling again
I know one day I'll love again
