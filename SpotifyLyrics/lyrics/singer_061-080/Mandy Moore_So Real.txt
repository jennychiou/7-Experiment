Innocence is what I've got.
It'll take true love to hit the spot.
Can't control my every move,
When we're together we're in the groove.
Don't care about your other girls
I'm the only one that rocks your world.
Gonna have to keep me satisfied,
'Cause my innocence won't be denied.

Baby it's real. (Baby Baby)
So, so real. (Baby Baby)
That I just can't explain the way (baby baby)
That it's making me feel. ooh (Baby baby)
So, so real,
Baby it's real.
I just can't let you go,
Baby it's real.
Keeps me hanging on,
Baby it's real.
Hey now.
My heart is under lock and key,
Together we can set it free.
Ain't no mountain that we can't climb-
All you gotta do is take your time. (your time)
I'm giving you my all and all,
Be careful you don't slip and fall.
It's my innocence that makes you yearn
For that perfect gift you can't return.

Baby you know that it's real,
The way your making me feel
YOU know that baby, baby, baby it's real

Baby you know that it's real,
The way your making me feel
YOU know that baby, baby, baby it's real

Baby you know that it's real,
The way your making me feel
YOU know that baby, baby, baby it's real

Baby you know that it's real,
The way your making me feel
YOU know that baby, baby, baby it's real
