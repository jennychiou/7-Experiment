You did everything
I asked you not to
Look where it got you
I'm sure
You heard it before
How could you?
Baby, why would you?

Goodbye, sweetheart
Countdown started
Words are heavy
But I'm far from broken hearted
Goodbye stranger
I'll take the fall
Lies were tempting
You know you never really threw me off at all
Go ahead
Waste your time
Count me out
Take your place at the end of the line
Raise a glass
No surprise
Here's to us at the end of the line (oh)
Here's to us at the end of the line

I'll miss the version of you
Who loved me
And all that they don't see
You said you could be good
Somehow you're guilty
And you're not even sorry

Goodbye, sweetheart
Countdown started
Words are heavy
But I'm far from broken hearted
Goodbye stranger
I'll take the fall
Lies were tempting
You know you never really threw me off at all
Go ahead
Waste your time
Count me out
Take your place at the end of the line
Raise a glass
No surprise
Here's to us at the end of the line
Here's to us at the end of the line

Go ahead
Waste your time
Count me out
Take your place at the end of the line
Raise a glass
No surprise
Here's to us at the end of the line
Here's to us at the end of the line
