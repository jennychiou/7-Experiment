Fool's game to risk perfection
Out here alone on a wire
Unsuspecting victim of desire

You wear a thousand faces
A master of disguise
And I'm addicted to the madness in your eyes

You will always be the one I dream about
And I know my heart won't beat the same again
You will always be the shadow of a doubt
Now I go crazy wondering what we might have been

Your charms have made me suffer
Why do I care where you are
I'm afraid my dignity has strayed too far

Can't read what you're writing
Unable to make the call
Do you want me desperately
Or not at all

Can't read what you're writing
Unable to make the call
Do you want me desperately
Or not at all
