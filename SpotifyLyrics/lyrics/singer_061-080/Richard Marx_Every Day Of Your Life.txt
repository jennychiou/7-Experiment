You never really thought you'd live to see the day
When the walls around your heart were blown away.
Just close your eyes, and you will hear me say,
"It's all right."

The key to everything I need is in your hands.
The part of me that no one understands.
When all my bridges burn, you tell me that,
"It's all right."

One world, one ride,
One till the end of time.
I'll be someone standing by your side,
Every day of your life.

Il ya des jours ou par amour on oublie tout, - (there are some days where by love we forget it all,)
Le fou, les guerres, le chaos, les remous. - (the fire, the wars, the chaos, the currents.)
Rien ne sera jamais plus fort que nous. - (nothing will ever be as strong as we.)
It's all right.
On a la foi qui peut deplacer les montagnes, - (we have a faith that can move mountains,)
Et nos pensees qui toujours se rejoignent. - (and our thoughts which always come together.)
Tu sait que meme au loin, je t'accompagne. - (you know that even when I'm far away, I'm still with you.)
It's all right.

Yeah, yeah!

J's'rai la pour toi. - (I'll be there for you.)
Tu peux compter sur moi, - (you can count on me,)
Comme un ami que jamais ne t'oublie, - (like a friend who'll never forget you,)
Chaque jour de ta vie, - (every day of your life,)
Y'aura en moi, - (inside of me there will always be)
Toujours un peu de toi. - (a part of you.)
Fidele comme une ombre qui te suit, - (faithful as a shadow that follows you,)
Chaque jour de ta vie. - (every day of your life.)

Over and over your heart's been left bare,
Haunted by faith that has led you nowhere.
You don't need to call out my name,
'Cause I am always there!
Always there!
Yeah!

J's'rai la pour toi. - (I'll be there for you.)
Tu peux compter sur moi, - (you can count on me,)
Comme un ami que jamais ne t'oublie, - (like a friend who'll never forget you,)
Chaque jour de ta vie. - (every day of your life.)

Yeah, yeah.

Y'aura en moi, - (inside of me there will always be)
Toujours un peu de toi. - (a part of you.)
Fidele comme une ombre qui te suit, - (faithful as a shadow that follows you,)
Chaque jour de ta vie. - (every day of your life.)

Chaque jour de ta vie!
One like the earth and the sky!
Chaque jour de ta vie!
