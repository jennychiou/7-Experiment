You say that you need my love
And you're wantin' my body, I don't mind
Baby all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine

You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere, this

Physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
Physical attraction
Chemical reaction

Trying hard to get away
But I can't seem to fight the way I feel
Even though you're not for real
Your touch is driving me
Crazy and when you smile
It's just makin' me want you more and more
Baby won't you stay a while
It could be such a fantasy

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door

Out The Door...



"spoken:"
Your Confusing Me.
'Cause I don't know If you want me
But I know that I want you
And that's nothing to be ashamed of
What are you gonna do?

Well...

You say that you need my love
And you're wantin' my body, I don't mind
Baby all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine

You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere, this

Sweet Satisfaction... yeah...

Music Break (17 Seconds)

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door...
Out the Door...

Physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
Oh it's a Physical attraction
It's a Chemical reaction
Yeah

Attraction, reaction but so much satisfaction
Attraction, reaction but so much satisfaction
It's a Physical, Physical attraction
Physical attraction
A chemical reaction, A chemical reaction
