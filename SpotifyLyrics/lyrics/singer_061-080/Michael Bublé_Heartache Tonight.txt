Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
And make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to turn back now
There's too much going on

This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light, and we'll get it right
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know

Somebody's gonna hurt somebody
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right

Let's go
We can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parking lot
But either way, there's gonna be
A heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
