Nancy made me nervous, so sure of herself. I stutter and stammer when I spoke. Sally may be silly, we laughed all the time. We wound up just telling corny jokes. Lizzie made me dizzy, she talked a blue streak. Just trying to pay attention was unreal. But you, you seem no natural and honest when you speak. It's easy bein' with you 'cause I feel like, Me.

The way I always thought I ought to be. You found that magic hidden key that set my feeling's free and they sang like poetry full of love's simplicity. I know that I need no apology for bein' Me, just Me.

I guess I might sound selfish but I'm really not. 'Cause now that I know just who I am. I think I kind of like Me. I gotta lot to give. Where before I really didn't give a damn. And baby you know I love you for loving me enough. To help me see myself how did you know? That I couldn't care for any other till I knew myself enough to take the chance to grow into, Me.

The way I always thought I ought to be. You found that magic hidden key that set my feeling's free and they sang like poetry full of love's simplicity. I know that I need no apology for bein' Me, just Me.

You found Me.
