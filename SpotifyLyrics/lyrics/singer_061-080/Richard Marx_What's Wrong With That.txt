I may be rotten to the core
And stop me if you think I am
A kid in a candy store
The same as any dirty old man
I know I'm not the first to see
I guarantee I'm not the last
So take some good advice from me
Just try it once before you ask
I hear an enticing voice

(Live it up, live it up, do it now, boy)
I don't like the other choice
(Live it up, live it up)

What's wrong with that
What's wrong with the fountain of youth
What's wrong with that
What's wrong with a little self delusion
Who you think is foolin' who

And who will be the last to laugh
Here's another lame excuse
You're old enough to be her dad
I've heard all the reasons why

(Give it up, give it up, take a powder)
I turn them my blindest eye
(Give it up, give it up)

What's wrong with that
What's wrong with the fountain of youth
What's wrong with that
What's wrong with a little self delusion
What's wrong with that
What's wrong with a flower in bloom
What's wrong with that
What's wrong with a little self delusion

Days don't hide secrets of the heart
Only you and I do
Little white lies rip you right apart
And any way they want to
Life goes by, done before you start
I can't wait around to satisfy you

Chorus out
