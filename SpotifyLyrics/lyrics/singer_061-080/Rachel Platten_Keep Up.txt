How'd it happen?
I know it started with a strong attraction
One disappointment caused a chain reaction
And I'm so tired of asking are we okay, okay?
O-okay, okay

And I, I can't keep trying, I'm done compromising
'Cause the stars are lining up for once in my life
And you're on the ground when I'm climbing mountains
So, don't you drag me down

If you can't keep up
Then, baby, I am done, I've had enough
And I really need someone who lifts me up so high
Am I the only one who's trying?
Ooh, if you're wanting my love, love, love, love
Ooh, then you gotta keep up, up, up, keep up
'Cause you're always breaking down, and I'm fed up
And I really need someone who lifts me up
Feels like I'm the only one who's trying
Ooh, if you're wanting my love, love, love, love
Ooh, then you gotta keep up, up, up, keep up

It's so tragic
You went and lost your fire, and I'm all passion
And you're still making noise, but I hear static
But you'd love to hear me say I'm not okay, okay
O-okay, okay

I, I can't keep trying, I'm done comprising
'Cause the stars are lining up for once in my life
And you're on the ground when I'm climbing mountains
So, don't you drag me down

If you can't keep up
Then, baby, I am done, I've had enough
And I really need someone who lifts me up so high
Am I the only one who's trying?
Ooh, if you're wanting my love, love, love, love
Ooh, then you gotta keep up, up, up, keep up
'Cause you're always breaking down, and I'm fed up
And I really need someone who lifts me up
Feels like I'm the only one who's trying
Ooh, if you're wanting my love, love, love, love
Ooh, then you gotta keep up, up, up, keep up

(Here we go)
And I'm always chasing a rush, rush, rush, rush
And you're sitting, gathering dust, dust, dust, dust
And maybe I'm expecting too much, much, much, much
But I'm sick of keeping you up
And I'm always chasing a rush, rush, rush, rush
And you're sitting, gathering dust, dust, dust, dust
And maybe I'm expecting too much, much, much, much
But I'm sick of saying keep up

And I, I can't keep trying, I'm done compromising
So don't you drag me down

If you can't keep up
Then, baby, I am done, I've had enough (C'mon)
And I really need someone who lifts me up (So high) so high
Am I the only one (who's trying) who's trying?
Ooh, if you're wanting my love, love, love, love
Ooh, then you gotta keep up, up, up, keep up
("Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up")
'Cause you're always breaking down, and I'm fed up
("Fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up")
And I really need someone who lifts me up (So high)
Feels like I'm the only one (who's trying) who's trying
Ooh, if you're wanting my love, love, love, love
Ooh, then you gotta keep up, up, up, keep up
Ooh, if you're wanting my love, love, love, love
Ooh, then you gotta keep up
