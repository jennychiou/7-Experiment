You must be my lucky star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you and I start to glow
And I need your light
And baby you know

Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright make everything all right
Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright yeah

You must be my lucky star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost you'll be my guide
I just turn around and you're by my side

Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright make everything all right
Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright yeah

You may be my lucky star
But I'm the luckiest by far
But I'm the luckiest by far
But I'm the luckiest by far
But I'm the luckiest by far

Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright make everything all right
Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright yeah

Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright make everything all right
Starlight, star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright yeah
