(Boy)
Mandy Mandy
The sound of your voice
Is sweet like candy

There was a time when I was
All alone
Waiting for someone
I could call my own
I closed my eyes
And dreamt you up one day
My prince of charms would ride up and we'd fly away

Take me to a place
Where the magic between us becomes real
Take me all the way

Boy I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key, Show me love
The way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart
And never let me go

I must confess
You are the best
So baby come take me
(Take me baby take me away)
(Take me baby take me away)

We'll dance together
Where no one can see
With you alone
Is where I want to be
Uncharted territory we'll discover?
You'll always be my dream lover, ooh

Take me to a place
Where the magic between us becomes real
Take me all the way

Boy I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key, Show me love
The way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart
And never let me go

Yes you are the best
So baby come take me

Lock me in your heart

Oh baby oh baby
Lock me in your heart
So baby come take me

Take me to a place
Where the magic between us
So real
Take me all the way

Boy I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key, Show me love
The way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart
And never let me go

Yes you are the best
So baby come take me

Boy I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key, Show me love
The way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart
And never let me go

Yes you are the best
So baby come take me

Take me baby take me away
Take me baby take me away
Take me baby take me away
Take me baby take me away
Take me baby take me away
Take me baby take me away
