Is it that we've been together much too long
The answer may not be in black and white
We're always tryin' to prove who's right or wrong
And now we're givin' up without a fight

But I know when you're gone
I wish I held on
So baby surrender to me
There'll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me
Tonight

I don't want our love
To cause you so much pain
If this is how it's gonna be
I'll walk away
Oh neither one of us
Should ever say goodbye
Let's forget about the past and who's to blame

'Cause when this is all gone
We'll wish we'd held on
So baby surrender to me
There'll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me
Tonight

How could this love be in danger
Used to be so good
So right
To think that faith could make us strangers
Slowly in your arms
Tonight

So baby surrender to me
There'll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me
Tonight

Oh baby surrender
