Know you've heard this one before
Two people fall in love, and one loves the other more
You rise and fall, you curse it all
That's the way it went for me
Then you changed the way I see
You make it feel the way I always wanted love to be
So safe to fall, so comfortable
You don't know what you do for me

'Cause demons get in my head sometimes
And they beat me up and they tell me lies
But you see the good, and you hold it tight
Yeah, you are the reason that I see in blinding lights

Now I know, now I know that
When I give love, I get love back
Now I know, now I know that
When I say that I love you, I get love back
Save me from the silent nights, answers that I couldn't find
Now I know, now I know that
When I say that I love you, I get love back

Keep me steady on my feet
When I am inside your arms, there's no harm that comes to me
My heart is full, invincible
You know exactly what I need

When demons get in my head sometimes
You pull me close, and you let me cry
You stay awake 'til I close my eyes
Yeah, you are the reason that I see in blinding lights

Now I know, now I know that
When I give love, I get love back
Now I know, now I know that
When I say that I love you, I get love back
Save me from the silent nights, answers that I couldn't find
Now I know, now I know that
When I say that I love you, I get love back

You did that, you did that, you did that for me
You made me, you made me believe
That it's safe now, it's safe now, it's safe now for me
To get love, 'cause I get love back

Now I know, now I know that
When I give love, I get love back
Now I know, now I know that
When I say that I love you, yeah, I get love back
Now I know, now I know that
When I give love, I get love back
Now I know, now I know that
When I say that I love you, I get love back
Save me from the silent nights, answers that I couldn't find
Now I know, now I know that
When I say that I love you, I get love back

Yes, I do, yes, I do
I get love back
Yes, I do, yes, I do
I get love back
