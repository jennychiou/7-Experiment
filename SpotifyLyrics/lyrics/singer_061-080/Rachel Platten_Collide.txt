Lately, I feel like I'm pushing you away
Acting moody for no reason
And even though you know I'm always gonna stay
I've been talking like I'm leaving

I don't know why I keep playing these dumb games
Love is not a competition
No one's winning when I'm pushing you away
Sometimes darkness is a prison

Turn the lights on, honey, honey, I don't wanna hide
Turn the lights on, honey, I'm surrendering tonight
Although I'm not perfect, I feel perfect in your eyes
Turn the lights on, honey, I don't really wanna hide, not tonight
Come and crash into me 'cause I want us to collide
Collide, collide, collide
Collide, collide, collide

Look into my eyes and tell me we're okay
And we both can be forgiven
Kiss me gently, say the things you wanna say
You don't need to ask permission

I'm a stormy ocean, but you're steady
And I'm all commotion, but you get me
Too many emotions, but you let me
Let me blossom in the dark

Turn the lights on, honey, honey, I don't wanna hide
Turn the lights on, honey, I'm surrendering tonight
Although I'm not perfect, I feel perfect in your eyes
Turn the lights on, honey, I don't really wanna hide, not tonight
Come and crash into me 'cause I want us to collide
Collide, collide, collide
Collide, collide, collide

I'm a stormy ocean, but you're steady
I'm like al commotion, but you get me
Too many emotions, but you let me
Let me blossom in the dark

Turn the lights on, honey, honey, I don't wanna hide
Turn the lights on, honey, I'm surrendering tonight
Although I'm not perfect, I feel perfect in your eyes
Turn the lights on, honey, I don't really wanna hide, not tonight
Come and crash into me 'cause I want us to collide
Collide, collide, collide
Collide, collide, collide
Collide, collide, collide
Collide, collide, collide
