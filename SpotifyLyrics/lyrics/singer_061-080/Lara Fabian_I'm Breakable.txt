Touched me so soft you made me cry
Looked in my eyes and read my mind
I am falling, falling
I hold my breath afraid to look
Weightless I feel you lift me up
Feels like falling, I am falling

And from this height
I'm petrified
Oh, I realize
I'm breakable
I'm breakable
I'm petrified
But I'm alive
I'm breakable
I'm breakable

You changed the plan erased the past
I don't know how it came so fast
I am falling, I am falling
How did you mend these broken wings
Now that you've saved these fragile wings
I am falling, I am falling

And from this height
I'm petrified
Oh, I realize
I'm breakable
I'm breakable
I'm petrified
But I'm alive
I'm breakable

When I'm in your arms
I feel so safe
That even if I break
I'll be all right
I'll be all right
I am insecure there is no shame
Until you say my name
And I'll be all right
I'm breakable
I'm breakable
Might have to fight to stay alive
