Keep on pushing...
Like nobody...

You push me.
To go the extra mile,
You push me.
When it's dificult to smile,
You push me.
A better version of myself,
You push me.
Only you and no one else,
You push me.
See the other point of view,
You push me.
When there's nothing else to do,
You push me.
When I think I know it all,
You push me.
When I stumble and I fall.

Keep... on... pushing...
Like... nobody...

Every race I win,
Every mood I'm in,
Everything I do, I owe it all to you.
Every move I make,
Every step I take,
Everything I love,
It's all because you... push... me.

You push me.
When I don't appreciate,
You push me.
Not to lie and not to hate,
You push me.
When I want it all to end,
You push me.
When I really need a friend,
You push me.
All I wanna do is cry,
You push me.
When It's hard for me to try,
You push me.
Learn to do it for myself,
You push me.
Only you and no one else.

Keep... on... pushing...
Like... nobody...

Every race I win,
Every mood I'm in,
Everything I do, I owe it all to you.
Every move I make,
Every step I take,
Everything I do,
It's all because you... push... me.

You... push... me...
Keep... on... pushing...
Like... nobody...

To go the extra mile (When it's dificult to smile),
Only you, and only you, and only you (See the other point of view).
Wen there's nothing else to do (When I think I know it all).
Only you, and only you, and only you.

Every race I win,
Every mood I'm in,
Everything I do, I owe it all to you.
Every move I make,
Every step I take,
Everything I love,
It's all because you... push... me.
You... push... me...
