Just one of those things when everything goes incredible and all is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all cause life is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

Remembering the very first time, you caught that someone special's eye
And all of your care dropped and all of the world just stopped
(I hope) I want to go back to then, got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me, I want it to fill me

Just one of those things when everything goes incredible and all is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all cause life is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

You don't know what you got 'til it is gone and everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listening and something is missing
(I hope) I want to go back to then, got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me, I want it to fill me

Just one of those things when everything goes incredible and all is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all cause life is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all cause life is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

I remember when you were the one, you were my friend
You gave me life, you were the sun, you taught me things
I didn't run, I fell to my knees, I didn't know why
I started to breathe, I wanted to cry
I need a reminder so I can relate
I need to go back there before it's too late

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to put your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'

Just one of those things when everything goes incredible and all is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all cause life is beautiful
Can-ca-ca-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it
Can't get my head around it, I-I need to think about it

Incredible, let's finish what we started
Incredible, you're welcome to my party

I don't want this to end, I am missing my best friend
It was incredible, there is no reason
Sex with you is ah

Don't want this thing to end, I am missing my best friend
Yes, it was incredible, there's no reason to pretend

It's time to get your body movin'
It's time to put your hands up ("continues to background")

It's incredible, unachievable
It's incredible, metaphysical
