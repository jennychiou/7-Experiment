Beware, beware, beware 

Seems like love should be easier to bear
But it's such a heavy load
(A heavy load)
Worldwide traveler, you ain't been nowhere
Tiil you've traveled down the road
(Do-do-do-do)
I know I may be just a stranger
(Just a stranger) 
Lover, let me warn you where's
The danger of a fork in love's road
(In the road, the road) 
Beware, the danger's there
Ah-ah-ah, danger

One way is for those who go along
That way tempts a girl like me
(Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, but lovers, don't try to make it on your own
(Don't try it, don't try it, don't try it)
You don't want this misery, oh-oh
Why didn't I see the sign
Ooh-ooh, before I left my love behind
At the fork in love's road
(In the road, the road)
Beware, the danger's there
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

If there is something
That you don't see eye to eye
(Eye to eye)
You better think before
You tell your love goodbye
(Goodbye)
'Cause your path may never cross again
You make sure you take the same bend
At the fork in love's road, baby

(Beware) The danger's there
Watch for the fork in the road
You better beware
(The fork in the road)
Beware (beware)
The danger's there
(Beware)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Beware)
(The fork in the road)
The fork in love's road
(Beware)
You better beware
(Beware)
