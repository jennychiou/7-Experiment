Well, now, it takes more than a robin
To make the winter go,
And it takes two lips of fire
To melt away the snow.

Well, it takes two hearts a'cookin'
To make a fire grow,
And, baby, you've got what it takes.
Now, listen, honey. (All right, baby.)

You know, it takes a lot of kissin'
Oh, to make a romance sweet.
Oh, it takes a lot of lovin'
To make my life complete.

Oh, well, it takes somebody special
To knock my off my feet,
And, baby, you've got what it takes.

I said, Ooh,
Uh huh, Ooh,
You know you've got just what it takes.

Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true,
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do,"
And, baby, you've got what it takes.

Uh huh, Ooh,
Uh huh, Ooh,
You know you've got just what it takes.

Because it takes a lot of effort to stay away from you,
And it takes more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true,
Well, it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do,"
And, baby, you've got what it takes,
C'mon, say that again, honey.
And, baby, you've got what it takes,
One more time, c'mon,
And, baby, you've got what it takes.

You've got it, you've got it.
Mmmhmm, you know you've got what it takes,
You've got it, you've got it.
And, baby, don't you know you've got what it takes.
You've got it, you've got it.
You've got it, baby!
