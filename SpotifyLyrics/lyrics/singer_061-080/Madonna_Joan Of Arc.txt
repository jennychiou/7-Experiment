Each time they take a photograph
I lose a part I can't get back
I wanna hide

This is the part where I detach
Each time they write a hateful word
Dragging my soul into the dirt
I wanna die
Never admit it but it hurts

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

One little lie can ruin my day
Words are like weapons they betray
When I am afraid
One word of kindness, it can save me

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day I won't care
But for the moment I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not Joan of Arc
