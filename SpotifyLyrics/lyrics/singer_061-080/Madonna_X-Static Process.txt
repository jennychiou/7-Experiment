I'm not myself when you're around
I'm not myself standing in a crowd
I'm not myself and I don't know how
I'm not myself, myself right now

Jesus Christ, will you look at me
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Don't really know if I should give a damn
When you're around, I don't know who I am

I'm not myself when you go quiet
I'm not myself all alone at night
I'm not myself, don't know who to call
(I'm not myself when you go quiet)
I'm not myself at all

Jesus Christ, will you look at me
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Don't really know if I should give a damn
When you're around, I don't know who I am

I always wished that I could find
Someone as beautiful as you
But in the process I forgot
That I was special too

I'm not myself when you're around
(I'm not myself when you go quiet)
I'm not myself all alone at night
(I'm not myself standing in a crowd)
I'm not myself and I don't know how
No, not myself, myself right now
(Don't know what I believe)

Jesus Christ, will you look at me
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Someone say if I should give a damn
(Don't really know if I should give a damn)
When you're around, I don't know who I am

I always wished that I could find
Someone as beautiful as you
But in the process I forgot
That I was special too
I always wished that I could find
Someone as talented as you
But in the process I forgot
That I was just as good ... as you
