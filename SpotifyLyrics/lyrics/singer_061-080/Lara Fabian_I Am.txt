I Am  

How many miles, how many steps must I take?
How many tears, how many times can I break?
Show me the meaning now
Show me the reasons why
Does it make sense somehow?

All that I am is what I was and who I'll be
Here where I stand is all I have
And what you see
Take theses empty hands
This is all I am
I am

I'm letting go
Don't wanna fight anymore
I need to show every side of my heart
Now I can face the night
Daring to dream again
Suddenly I'm alive

All that I am is what I was and who I'll be
Here where I stand is all I have
And what you see
Take theses empty hands
This is all I am
I am
This is all I am

I never thought our love had a beautiful side
'Til I surrendered
You never feel the wind till you run for your life

All that I am is what I was and who I'll be
Here where I stand is all I have
And what you see
All what I am
Here where I stand
Take theses empty hands
Take theses empty hands
This is all
I am
I am
This is all I am
