My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for furs and laces
My baby don't care for high-tone places

Brando just ain't her style
And even Mr. Clooney's smile
It's something she don't see

My baby don't care
Who knows it?
My baby just cares for me

Oh, Brando just ain't her style
And even Mr. Connick's smile
It's something she don't see
It's something she can't see

I wonder what's wrong with baby?
She ain't scared to show it
She don't care who knows it
My baby just cares for-
Ah, she just says her prayers for-
My baby just cares for me

Only cares for me
She only loves me
