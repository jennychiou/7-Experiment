I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
You're so deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
And I've got you under my skin

I've tried so not to give in
You know I've said to myself this affair ain't gonna go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby I know so well
That I've got you way under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats in my ear

Don't you know, you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, step up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you, you're under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in these ears

Don't you know, you fool, no chance to win
Why not choose your mentality, wake up, step up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
And I love you under my skin
