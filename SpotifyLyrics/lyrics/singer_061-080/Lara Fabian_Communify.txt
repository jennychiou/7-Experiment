You hear me talking
Your head is nodding
Like you agree

My true intentions
Have lost attention
But that's on me

Want to understand what you understand
Lost in translation can get out of hand
Let's make a new word that we've never heard
Born out of the need to put our love first

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge
We have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just
Just communify

You are the one
I choose to care for
The one I see

I am the other
I need to trust you
With being me

Want to understand what you understand
Lost in translation can get out of hand
Let's make a new word that we've never heard
Born out of the need to put our love first

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge
We have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just
Just communify

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge
We have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just
Just communify

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge
We have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just
Just communify
