Everybody's trying to mend a broken heart.
Buy a little bit of love and try to start.
Sew your secrets up with cotton and string.
Teach yourself little recipes and things to say.

I'm not like that, It's not like that.
I don't hurt like they do.
But oh you like that. Yes you like that.
Yes you need somebody too.

We put on Navy suits and march and keep in line.
And laugh at all the silly people out of time.
We count the minutes till we heal it with our wine.
We climb in bed with pretty strangers and we cry oh oh oh.

I'm not like that, I'm not like that.
I don't wanna hurt like they do.

They find it hard to be alone.
Like every one else that we know.
And when our heads hurt in the dark,
We look for beautiful remarks.
We find it hard to be alone.
Like every one else that we know.
We get our heads hurt in the dark.
We need some beautiful remarks.
(Yes we do.)

We hang up photographs of people that we love.
And when we glance at them we think, "Well that's enough."
But when our mothers call we're busy doing stuff.
We'll get back to them when things start clearing up oh oh oh.

I'm not like that, It's not like that.
I don't hurt like they do.
It's not like that, yes it's like that.
Yes you need somebody too.
You're just like that.
Yeah it's like that.
Yeah you need somebody too.
Oh you like that, yes you like that.
Yes you need somebody too.
