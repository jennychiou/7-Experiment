Now I can tell you
About success, about fame
About the rise and the fall of all the stars in the sky
Don't it make you smile?
That it will be
Just let it be, be
Won't you let it be?

Now I can tell you
About the place I belong
You know it won't last long
And all those lights they will turn down
That it will be
Oh, let it be
Just let it be, be
Won't you let it be?

Now I can see things
For what they really are
I guess I'm not that far
I'm at the point of no return
Just watch me burn!

That it will be
Just let it be
Oh, let it be
Then, it will be (Just let it be)
Just let it be (That it will be)
Oh let it be (Won't you let it be?)
Let it be (Won't you let it be...?)

Now I can tell you
The place that I belong
It won't last long
The lights, they will turn down

Oh, let it be
Oh, let it be
Oh, let it be (Won't you let it be?)
Oh, let it be (You've got to let it be)
Just let it be (Anyone can see)
Won't you let it be (That it will be)?

Just watch me go
Oh, let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?
Won't you let it be (Just let it be)?
Oh, let it be (Let it be)
Just let it be (Won't you let it be?)
Won't you let it be (Won't you let it be?)?
Won't you let it be?

Now I can tell you
Tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you
About success, about fame
About fame, about fame, about fame, about fame

Won't you let it be?
Oh, let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?
