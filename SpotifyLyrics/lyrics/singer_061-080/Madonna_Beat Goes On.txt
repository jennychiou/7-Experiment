Ooh, mm!, why, heh heh, let's dance, again!

Don't sit there like some silly girl
If you wait too long you'll be too late
I'm not telling you something new
There ain't no time to lose (no time to lose)
It's time for you to celebrate

(So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Get up, little girl
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
It's time, your world
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Your life, your choice
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
It's time, live it up

On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

You don't have the luxury of time
You have got to say what's on your mind
Your head lost in the stars
You'll never go far (no time to lose)
It's time for you to read the signs

(So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Here comes, my hand
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Take it, you can
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
The time, is now
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
I'll show, you how

On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

Say what you like (say what you like)
Do what you feel (do what you feel)
You know exactly who you are
The time is right now
You got to decide
Stand in the back or be the star
(Don't sit in the back)

(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Here comes, my hand
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Take it, you can
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
The time, is now
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
I'll show, you how

On and on

I can't keep waiting for you (for you)
Anticipating that you've
No time to lose (for you)
I can't keep waiting for you

"'Kanye West"'
"Uh, it's the impromptu, I want you, now I'm gonna do to you what I want to... do to you
Your girlfriend she wants to, beautiful, just flew in from Paris- voulez-vous
In a city that don't snooze, shmooze amongst the whos-whos
And I use my celeb to get this one home
Why everything that feel good, gotta be so wrong?
Give me room now, I'm like a vampire on a full moon now
And I don't know about you now but I think I wanna try sumtin new now, see what it do now
And when you sat down, uh, cause you was losing your breathe now, uh
Cause you be doin' it to def now, she'd be doin' E to F now, what's left now?
Mister West now, can you get any more fresh now? I think I just diiid just now
Talkin' my shiiit, that's how, I'm a professional
I admit that, flashin' lights so I live that
Fame is a drug, wanna hit that?
'Cause I know exactly where to get that, did you get that?

Get down, beep beep, gotta get up offa your seat
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up offa your seat now"

On and on, on and on... oh hey! Oh hey!

The beat goes, on and on
"Cause I know exactly where to get that, did you get that?
Let's go"

Beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat
The beat goes
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat
The beat goes, on and on
Hey! Oh hey!
The beat goes, on and on
Hey! Oh hey!
The beat goes, on and on
Oh hey! Oh hey!
On and on
Hey! Oh hey!
On and on, on and on, on and on...
