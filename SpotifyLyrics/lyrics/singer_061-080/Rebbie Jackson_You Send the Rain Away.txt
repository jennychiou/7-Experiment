I was out in the storm
Lost and so lonely
I needed your protection

No one keeping me warm
No one to hold me
To give my life direction

Every cloud has a silver lining
Turning my grey skies to blue
Here you are shining
Like the sun breaking through
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

You send the rain away
Love has dried up the tears on my window
You send the rain away
You're the gold at the end of my rainbow
Darling, you send the rain away

Looking out at the light
With you here beside me
I can't sleep forever

Your love turned on the light
I know that you'll guide me
As long as we're together

Seeing you lying on my pillow
Every breath and beat of my heart
Saying I'll never be alone in the dark
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

You send the rain away
Love has dried up the tears on my window
You send the rain away
You're the gold at the end of my rainbow

You send the rain away
Love has dried up the tears on my window (baby)
You send the rain away (you send the rain away)
You're the gold at the end of my rainbow

Take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna lose you (don't wanna lose you)
Don't you ever let go
Just hold on tight (hold on tight)
It feels so right to me
Don't slip through my fingers (slip through my fingers)
Take a ride on the wings of a dream
You're the morning light every night

You send the rain away
Love has dried up the tears on my window
You send the rain away
You're the gold at the end of my rainbow

You send the rain away (you send the rain away baby)
Love has dried up the tears on my window (woo)
You send the rain away (you send the rain away)
You're the gold at the end of my rainbow
