In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between

Life is like a desert
An oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razor's edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

Turn a blind eye
Try to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or
Running away from all this madness

Who am I to decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me

Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You could thread a needle
With a tear drop from my eye

It's a cruel injustice
To be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer
When it's right in front of me

From the Tower of Babylon
Where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I to decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me

Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me

Who am I to decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me

Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me
