I'm not ready to confront
I'd rather cement my words this way
This could be the easy road out
But I'm just not all that happy
So I'm writing all this down
And I'll file it in a drawer someday
In lieu of a conversation
We'd probably forget to have anyway

I won't hold anything back
And I won't hold anything in
Feel like I know where this is going
And I might know how it ends
But I'm still
Willing to begin

You should know my story by now
And why I'm optimistic cautiously
I understand it's not your fault
But I'm not takin' anything back
You still end up with
Most of me

I won't hold anything back
And I won't hold anything in
Feel like I know where this is going
And I might know how it ends
But I'm still
Willing to begin

I expect you to fly from NY to LA
And land on my doorstep
And smile at me and say
It was worth it to see most of me
Do you love most of me?

You're just crossing paths
With the way he left me
I'm not sayin' a word
But I'm watching you quietly
You're gonna have to prove me wrong
Before I know this is right
We don't have to decide tonight
Just wait for me patiently
And you'll get all of me

I won't hold anything back
And I won't hold anything in
Feel like I know where this is going
And I might know how it ends
But I'm still
Willing to begin
