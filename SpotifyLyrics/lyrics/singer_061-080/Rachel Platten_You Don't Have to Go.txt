I try to take it slow
But this guy just moves me so
If his hands move anymore
I think that I might lose control

I'm shaking through these clothes
He's breathing like he knows
That my heart's a little unsure
But my body still wants more

And I'm hoping, praying, something will rescue me
Before I give up the rest of me
Can I? Am I? Thinking this

You don't have to go,
Stay the night and we'll take it slow
We don't have to know how far we're going
If you want to stay,
Well, we could go all the way
We can just forget it in the morning

And the other day,
I might not be an easy lay
And you can't call it luck
I bet sometimes a girl just need a friend

And I'm hoping, praying, something will rescue me
Before I give up the rest of me
Can I? Am I? Thinking this

You don't have to go,
Stay the night and we'll take it slow
We don't have to know how far we're going
If you want to stay,
Well, we could go all the way
We can just forget it in the morning

And you keep coming closer
But if I push you it's over
But if we're careful
It's never gonna feel the same
You keep coming closer
I pull you in closer
Just 'cause you're older

(Repeat x2)
You don't have to go,
Stay the night and we'll take it slow
We don't have to know how far we're going
If you want to stay,
Well, we could go all the way
We can just forget it in the morning

You don't have to go,
Stay the night and we'll take it slow
We don't have to know how far we're going
