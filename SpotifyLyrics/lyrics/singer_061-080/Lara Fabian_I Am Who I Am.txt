Feels like you've built a wall around me
You've tried your best to ground me
Let me explain that I don't play by any other rules
I won't be nobody's fool - I won't lose this game
There is no way
I can love you with half of my heart
It would tear me apart

I am who I am
What else could I be
And I'll stand where I stand
I chose to be me
When you look in my eyes
You get what you see
Understand if you can
That I am who I am who I am

Think twice before you try to read me
Before you try to lead me into your trap
You've got no right to play with my emotion
'Cause you should know that I'm much deeper
Than that
There is no way
I can love you with half of my heart
It would tear me apart

Repeat chrous

There is no way
I can love you with half of my heart
It would tear me apart
