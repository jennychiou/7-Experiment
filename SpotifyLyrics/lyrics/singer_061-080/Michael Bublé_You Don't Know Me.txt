You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
Well, you don't know me

No, you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
Oh I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me

For I never knew
The art of making love
Though my heart aches
With love for you
Afraid and shy
I've let my chance go by
The chance that you might
Love me, too

You give your hand to me
And then you say good-bye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
You'll never know
The one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me

You give your hand to me, baby
And then you say good-bye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never ever know
The one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me
