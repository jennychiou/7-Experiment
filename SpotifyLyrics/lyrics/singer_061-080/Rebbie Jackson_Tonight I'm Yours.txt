Issac: Hey, baby
Rebbie: Hi, honey
Isaac: What'chu doin'?
Rebbie: Oh, I'm workin' hard
Isaac: You know what I was thinkin' about?
Rebbie: About me?
Isaac: You got it
You know what else I was thinkin' about?
Rebbie: A candlelight dinner
And a nice cold glass of wine
Isaac: Ooh, I can hardly wait
Tonight I'm yours

I been spendin' all my time
Here on the telephone line
Workin' from nine to five
Keepin' our love alive
Desperately wanting you
There's nothing I can do
Seems my day time
Has suddenly disappeared

Night time
I can take you in my arms
Fill you with all the charms
Tonight I'm yours
Darlin'
All through the night
I want you to hold me tight
'Cause tonight I'm yours

So mad in love with you
Just don't know what to do
Wonderin' to myself
Don't want nobody else
Now that the daytime is over
There's no need
To want any further
It's time
For our love to begin

Night time (night time)
I can take you in my arms
Fill you with all the charms
'Cause tonight I'm yours
Darlin' (Darlin')
All through the night
I want you to hold me tight
'Cause tonight I'm yours
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't you know
Tonight I'm yours?

Rebbie: The days, they seem so long
Me wanting to hold you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Don't you know that tonight I'm yours?)
Isaac: I can never, never get enough
Of your sweet, sweet lovin'

Night time
I can take you in my arms
Fill you with all the charms
'Cause tonight I'm yours
Darlin'
All through the night
I want you to hold me tight
'Cause tonight I'm yours
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Isaac: Ooh, baby
Rebbie: Baby
Isaac: Don't you know
Tonight I'm yours?

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rebbie: Tonight I'm yours, baby
Tonight I'm yours
