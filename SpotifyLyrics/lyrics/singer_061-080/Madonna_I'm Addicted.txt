When did your name change from a word to a charm
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters pushed to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic
I write it again on the back of my hand and I know it sounds tragic
Your name's like a drug and I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove, I'm addicted to your love

I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted to your love

I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love

Now that your name pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind, it's like MDMA
"(That's okay)"
Your name's like a drug and I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove, I'm addicted to your love

I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm ready to take this path
I need to dance

Your name's like a drug and I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove, I'm addicted to your love

I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love
