You had all of me, you wanted more
Would you had married me if I were poor?
I guess if I was your treasury
You’d have found the time to treasure me
 
How come you can’t see
All that you need
Was right here with me

Up until the end
All this pretend
Wasn’t for free

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

Now you have your money
Spend it till there’s nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

If we opened up a joint account
Would it put an end to all your doubt?
Frankly if my name was Benjamin
We wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in

You played with my heart
Till death do we part
That’s what you said
Now you have your fast car
Women and bars
It’s gone to your head

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

Love me like your money
Spend it till there’s nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

Spend your love on me

I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold on to me till there’s nothing left

Love spent
Really love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Wondering where the love went

Love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold on to me till there’s nothing left
"(Nothing left, nothing left, nothing left)"

Love spent
Really love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Wondering where the love went

Love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold on to me till there’s nothing left
"(Nothing left, nothing left, nothing left)"
