We can chase the moon down
Put it in a pocket and carry it around
We could hop on a star
Holding on for dear life
Yeah, we can reach that far

Be whatever we want
Only matters if we believe or not
Be whatever we want
Anything between black or white

We can be chameleons
Change at our convenience
All right, all right
We can be chameleons
Choosing our own preference
All right, all right
We can be
We can be chameleons
We can be
We can be chameleons

Do you need a sunrise?
Want to be a mountain
Well that's what we could be
We could eat from that tree
The forbidden fruit it grows for you and me

Be whatever we want
Only matters if we believe or not
Be whatever we want
Anything between black or white

We can be chameleons
Change at our convenience
All right, all right
We can be chameleons
Choosing our own preference
All right, all right
We can be
We can be chameleons
We can be
We can be chameleons

We can be
We can be chameleons
We can be
We can be chameleons

We can be chameleons
Change at our convenience
It's all right, all right
We can be chameleons
Choosing our own preference
All right, all right
We can be
We can be chameleons
We can be
We can be chameleons

We can be
We can be chameleons
We can be
We can be chameleons
