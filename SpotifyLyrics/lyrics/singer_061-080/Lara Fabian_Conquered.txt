Conquered  

Tell me, tell me how you knew about my heart
You see, see the things that no one else could see
I thought, I was doing fine until you turn my life around
With everything you'd find
Deep inside I thought that I had died

(You make me believe) When I thought that love was gone, all gone
(You make me believe) And you prove that love was strong, so strong
(You make me believe) 'Cause you touch inside of me
Something I would never have believed
Until
Until you conquered me

You say, you can our future
In my eyes
You say, you can break the chain that always ties me there
Teach me how to fly again
You make my life complete
The love you give to me
Deep inside I know that this is right

'Cause you make me believe
(You make me believe) When I thought that love was gone, all gone
(You make me believe) And you prove that love was strong, so strong
(You make me believe) 'Cause you touch inside of me
Something I would never have believed
Until
Until you conquered me

I was lost
I thought I would always be alone
I thought I could make it on my own
But you...
Changed my life
Now...
Everything I thought my life could be
Changed the day you conquered me

(You make me believe)
(You make me believe) When I thought that love was gone, all gone
(You make me believe) And you prove that love was strong, so strong
(You make me believe) 'Cause you touch inside of me
Something I would never have believed
Until
Until you conquered me

(When I thought that love was gone, all gone)
When I thought that love was gone
(And you prove that love was strong, so strong)
And you prove that love was strong
(Cause you touch inside of me)
'Cause you touch inside of me
(Something I would never have believed)
Something I would have never believed
Until you conquered me
(When I thought that love was gone, all gone)
When I thought that love was gone
(And you prove that love was strong, so strong)
And you prove that love was strong., strong
(Cause you touch inside of me)
'Cause you touch inside of me
