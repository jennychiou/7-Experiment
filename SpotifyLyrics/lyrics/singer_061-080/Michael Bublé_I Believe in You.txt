Time goes by
And I've been holding everything inside
But now I've got nothing left to hide
When I'm with you, oh, you

But I can see
How strong a man I'm gonna have to be
To do for you what comes so naturally
It's in the way you move

And all I want
Is a chance to prove
Show all I can do

I believe in starting over
I can see that your heart is true
I believe in good things coming back to you
You're the light that lifts me higher
So bright, you guide me through
I believe in you

And I don't mind
If you want to hold onto me tight
You don't have to sleep alone tonight
If you don't want to

And all I want
Is to know you're near
You're all I need here

I believe in starting over
I can see that your heart is true
I believe in good things coming back to you
You're the light that lifts me higher
So bright, you guide me through
I believe in you

I know that there are times
Where you feel worthless
Like all the love you get
You don't deserve it
Sometimes I feel my faith is just a burden
On you, you, you

I believe in starting over
I can see that your heart is true
I believe in love
You give me reason to
You're the light that lifts me higher
So high up in the sky
I, I think we're gonna fly

I believe in starting over
I can see that your heart is true
I believe in love
You give me reason to
You're the light that lifts me higher
So bright, you guide me through
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
You guide me through
I believe in you
