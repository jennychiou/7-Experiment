My dad, now here is a man.
To me he is ev'rything strong; no he can't do wrong, my dad.
My dad, now he understands when I bring him troubles to share;
Oh, he's always there, my dad.

And my heart would burst with pride.
My dad, oh, I love him so,
And I only hope that some day my own son will say,
"My dad, now here is a man."
