It's hard to see reason
When there's so little hope alive,
But this is the season
To put faith in innocent eyes.
We're all thinking too much,
We're so out of touch.
We need to start over again.
So just let it wander,
'Cause you're never too old to pretend.

Tell you, just a little miracle
Is all you need to believe
Just a little miracle
Is all you need to believe.
It's not too late to wake up.
Don't make no difference who you are.
Just take off your make-up,
And discover the child in your heart.

We're all thinking too much,
We're so out of touch.
We need to start over again.
So just let it wander
'Cause you're never too old to pretend.
