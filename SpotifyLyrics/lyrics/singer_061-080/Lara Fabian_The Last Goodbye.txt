We can run away together
If that's what you want
We can hide away forever
If that's what you want
So just close the door
Let nobody else in our head
Close the door
We can lay right here
In our bed

'Cause anything else
Is wasted time
You're all that I wanted
Out of my life
Just let me grow old
Here by your side
Until the end of time
Till the last goodbye

Let's just live here in the moment
Sharing something real
Let's not spend these ours talking
Just give me something I can feel
Oh come
Close to me
Let no ray of light in between
Close to me
We don't know
Where I end and you begin

Let's shut the world out
See a chance and let's take it
Seize on the moment
And baby let's make it out
And we'll work it out somehow
How to live in here and now
