I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's just where I belong
Yet I run into her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief
Takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime
Oh but I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss and hug her, kiss and hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brightens up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, it makes me feel whole
And it makes me mellow down into my soul
