If I let you love me
Chances are I'll love myself again
If I let you love me
Will you take it all or share
If I let you touch me
Will the addiction burn me up
Will it cure or crush me
If I let you love me

I will hand you all my doubts and fears
I will hand you my broken souvenirs

If I let you love me
Will you see the flaws and stay with me
If I let you strip me
Will you love me anyway
If I let you touch me
Will the addiction burn me up
Will it cure or crush me
If I let you love me

I will hand you all my doubts and fears
I will hand you my broken souvenirs

Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me with an honest eye
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now, I'm ready
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me we're too close to lie
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me are you ready

I will hand you all my doubts and fears
I will hand you my broken souvenirs
I will hand you all my doubts and fears
I will hand you my broken souvenirs
