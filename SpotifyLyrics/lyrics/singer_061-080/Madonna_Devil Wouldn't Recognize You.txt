As quiet, as it is tonight, you'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes, are full of surprises, they cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars, there's something you should know
The angels they surround my heart, telling me to let you go

I barely couldn't, I barely couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling for your own disguise

It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
I do, I do

You almost fooled yourself this time, that all the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile, and you keep your lost heartbreaks (keep your lost heartbreaks)
The steps that edge along the ledge, is much higher than it seems
But I've been on that ledge before, you can't hide yourself from me

I barely couldn't, I barely couldn't recognize
I still played right into it, who am I to criticize
Somehow I'll get through it, and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
And now that it's over, you can lie to me right through your smile...
I've seen behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
I do, I do

"[Justin]"
Oh, oh...


It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
And now that it's over, you can lie to me right through your smile...
I've seen behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you but, you but, you but, you but
Devil wouldn't recognize you but, you but, you,
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do, I-I, I do...
You, you, you, you, devil wouldn't recognize (recognize) you, you...
But I do

You, you

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you

I-I-I-I-I do
