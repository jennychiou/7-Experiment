Universe is full of stars 
Nothing out there looks the same
I'd say
You're the one that I've been waiting for 
I don't even know your name 

I'm in a trance 
I'm in a trance 

Cosmic systems intertwine 
Astral bodies drip like wine 
All of nature ebbs and flows 
Comets shoot across the sky 
Can't explain the reasons why, why
This is how creation goes 

I don't want nobody else, body else
All the others look the same, the same
Galaxies are sliding into view 
I don't even know your name 

I'm in a trance 
And the world is spinning 
Spinning baby out of control 
I'm in a trance 
I let the music take me 
Take me where my heart wants to go 

I'm in a trance 
And the world is spinning 
Spinning baby out of control 
I'm in a trance 
I let the music take me 
Take me where my heart wants to go 

Kiss me 
Kiss me 
Kiss me 

I like to singy, singy, singy 
Like a bird on a wingy, wingy, wingy 
I like to rhumba, rhumba, rhumba 
Dance to a samba, samba, samba 

I'm in a trance 
And the world is spinning 
Spinning baby out of control 
I'm in a trance 
I let the music take me 
Take me where my heart wants to go 

Trance 
I'm in a trance 
Universe is full of stars 
Nothing out there looks the same 
You're the one that I've been waiting for 
I don't even know your name
