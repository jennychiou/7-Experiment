Miss you more than ever
I will wait forever (I will wait)
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully (Hey)

My love every time I hear our favorite song
Tellin' me a house is not a home
I learned that it's true
Just being without you

Now I know what love is all about
And I know for certain, there's no doubt
I guess you know how foolish hearts can be
But baby, that's not me

Miss you more than ever
I will wait forever
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully

No need to worry
People are lonely
Baby, I will be yours only
Always yours faithfully (Hey)

I know, even though the time's not on our side
I believe the future will be bright
'Cause our love is enough
To keep me lookin' up

Wanna let you know that things are fine
Not a moment you're not on my mind
I'll be savin' all my love for you
And that's the honest truth

Miss you more than ever
I will wait forever
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully

No need to worry (No need to worry)
People are lonely
Baby, I will be yours only
Always yours faithfully

Hoo

Now I know what love is all about
And I know for certain, there's no doubt
I guess you know how foolish hearts can be
But baby, that's not me

Miss you more than ever
I will wait forever
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully

No need to worry
People are lonely
Baby, I will be yours only
Always yours faithfully

Miss you more than ever (Ooh)
I will wait forever
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully

No need to worry (No need to worry)
People are lonely
Baby, I will be yours only
Always yours faithfully

Miss you more than ever
I will wait forever
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully
