Counting days, counting days since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taken since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope that you'll come back when you can find some peace
Cause every word that I've heard spoken since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded by the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over, well there must be something in the tide

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

It's your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Even though I'm nothing to you now
Even though I'm nothing to you now

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

There must be something in the water
Cause everyday it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under
