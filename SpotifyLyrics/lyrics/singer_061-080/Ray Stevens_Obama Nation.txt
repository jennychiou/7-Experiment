Well
It started back in 1776
We told Old King George
We were sick of his tricks
Started our own thing
And called it the USA
(USA)

Well things went fine
Till 1864 we had a little falling out
Called the Civil War
But we got through that
And once again we were on our way
(On our Way)

We saw two World Wars
And the Great Depression
Korea and Viet Nam
Sure made an impression
Presidents lied to us on TV
But look at what we got today

It's an Obama Nation
(Obama Nation)
Yeah that's what we got
(That's what we got)
It's an Obama Nation
(Obama Nation)
And you can like it or not
(Like it or not)

You can forget about how we did it yesterday
Obama is changing things and doing it his way
And all I can say is
It's an Obama Nation
(Obama Nation)

Yeah
Well now he doesn't seem to care
About the Constitution
That's Passe
He's got new solutions
And no need to bother Congress
They just get in his way
With Executive orders
And a room full of Czars
He's taking over banks
And building our cars
He wants to run health care
And control our take home pay
(Take home pay)

His Keynesian ways are increasing our debt
We haven't even seen the start of it yet
Our grandkids are gonna be paying
Till their dyin' day

For this Obama Nation
(Obama Nation)
Yeah that's what we got
(That's what we got)
It's an Obama Nation
(Obama Nation)
And you can like it or not
(Like it or not)

His Tax
Spend
Spend
Tax
He's going break us all
But let's face the facts
He told us what he was going to do
It's his Obama Nation
(Obama Nation)

Well he bristles at "Liberal"
Or Socialist
He prefers "Progressive"
But you can bet on this
No matter whatcha call it friend
It's an Obama Nation
(Obama Nation)

Yeah
Ya know I think he
Wants to change USA to USSA
United Socialist States of America
Ha
Well Dosvedanya Commrade
Whew, Have mercy
Hey, You with the Obama sticker on your bumper
How is that Hope and Change working for ya?

Ya know me
I'm just hoping I'll have some change left in 2012
But that's just me
