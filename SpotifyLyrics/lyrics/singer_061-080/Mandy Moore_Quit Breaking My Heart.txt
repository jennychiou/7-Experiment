You were my first slow dance
Thought that we had a chance
But together was too hard for you

Hanging out with your friends
And I accept these things
All I need is for you to be true

I know you care
But it's just not fair
When you're not around
I want you there

And you need to stop
Breaking my heart

Quit breaking my heart
It's tearing apart
All I need is for you to be true (you to be true)
Quit breaking my heart
It's tearing us apart (oh)
Baby (oh yeah)
Quit breaking my heart
Baby I don't feel this way 'bout everyone
Something about you boy
Nothing seems to be quite like this
Holding your hand
Touching my face
Standing here waiting for our first kiss

I know you care
But it's just not fair
When you're not around
I want you there

And you need to stop
Breaking my heart

Quit breaking my heart
It's tearing apart
All I need is for you to be true (all I need)
Quit breaking my heart (oh quit breaking my heart)
It's tearing us apart (tearing us apart)
Baby (oh yeah)
Quit breaking my heart

Quit breaking my heart
Oh

I know you care
But it's just not fair
When you're not around
I want you there
You need to stop
You need to stop
Oh
Breaking my
Heart
Baby oh yeah
Quit breaking my heart

Quit breaking my heart
It's tearing apart (tearing us apart)
All I need is for you to be true
Quit breaking my heart (oh quit breaking my heart)
It's tearing apart
All I need is for you to be true
Quit breaking my heart
