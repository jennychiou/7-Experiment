I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell, so

Here's my story [my story]
No risk no glory [no glory]
A little

Up and down and all around
It's all about survival

Here's my question [my question]
Does your criticism [criticism]
Have you caught up in what you cannot see
Well if you give me respect
Then you'll know what to expect, a little

(Chorus, repeat)
(Chorus, repeat 3 times)

(Up and down and all around)
I'll never be an angel
(Up and down and all around, survival)
(Up and down and all around)
I'll never be a saint it's true
(Up and down and all around, survival)
(Repeat and fade)
