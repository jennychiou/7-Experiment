When I look into your eyes
I see sunshine
The coulds are blown away
I hope you're here to stay
'Cause you've got me needing more of you
Guess I'm falling for you

You walk away
My eyes caress you
Then you turn and smile
You've caught me thinking of love with you
Guess I'm falling, I may be falling for you

Since I met you days are brighter
Life's uneven loads are lighter
When I hear you whisper the words I long to hear dear
Now I look into your eyes
I'm lost in knowing that you are all I want 
My need for you is growing
Guess I'm falling, I think I'm falling for you
Think about falling for me too
