I know I'm being irrational
Right now a little bit flammable
So you'd better watch out (Watch out)
I know I'm dressing so casual
In my bed laying diagonal
'Cause I'm all alone now (Right now)

In three words
My heart hurts
So why do I feel it in my whole body?
All over
It's the worst
Feeling down has just become a hobby

I'll stand on my feet, but not today
I'll hit delete, throw it all away
I'll be so sweet right to your face
But when you leave, just let me cry, get it all out, baby
I'll be alright, just gotta play
Alanis all night and throughout the day
I'll pick myself up, but not today
Today I'm a mess, just let me cry, get it all out, baby

Boy, you're not even emotional
Out every night, uncontrollable
How do you do it? (How?)
Why do you post everything you do?
Is it 'cause you want me to know that you
You're doing better (Better than me)

In three words
My heart hurts
So why do I feel it in my whole body?
All over
It's the worst
Feeling down has just become a hobby

I'll stand on my feet, but not today
I'll hit delete, throw it all away
I'll be so sweet right to your face
But when you leave, just let me cry, get it all out, baby
I'll be alright, just gotta play
Alanis all night and throughout the day
I'll pick myself up, but not today
Today I'm a mess, just let me cry, get it all out, baby

Get it all out, baby
Get it all out, baby
Just let me kick, let me scream
Just let me kick, let me scream in my pillow
Just let me get, catch you out (Let me get you out)
Just let me get, get you out of my system

I'll stand on my feet, but not today
I'll hit delete, throw it all away
I'll be so sweet right to your face
But when you leave, just let me cry, get it all out, baby
I'll be alright, just gotta play
Alanis all night and throughout the day
I'll pick myself up, but not today
Today I'm a mess, just let me cry, get it all out, baby
