Goodbye Joe, me gotta' go, me oh my oh
Me gotta' go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun, on the bayou.

Jumbalaya, and a crawfish pie, and a file gumbo.
Cause' tonight I'm gonna' see my Machez a mio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar, and be gay- oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun, on the bayou.

Thibodeaux, Fontainbleau, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

Jumbalaya, and a crawfish pie, and a file gumbo.
Cause' tonight I'm gonna' see my Machez a mio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar, and be gay- oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun, on the bayou.

Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a fillet gumbo
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my machez a mio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
