You'll never find, as long as you live,
Someone who loves you as tender like I do.
And you'll never find, no matter where you search,
Someone who cares about you the way I do.

No, I'm not braggin' on myself, babe,
'Cause I'm the one who loves you,
And there's no one else! No one else!

And you'll never find, it'll take the end of all time,
Someone who understands you like I do.

No, I'm not tryin' to make you stay, babe,
'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there is no one else, no,
No one else...
No one else...

You're gonna miss my lovin' ...
You're gonna miss my love...

Ooh ha, yes you are, yeah...

And you'll never find,
And you'll never find,
Another love like mine,
Another love like mine,
Someone who needs you like I do

Are you sure baby

No I'm not braggin' on myself, babe,
'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there is no one else,
And there is no one else, no...

There's just no one else,
No one else...

You're gonna miss my love,
I'm gonna miss your love,
You're gonna miss my love,
You're gonna miss my love.
