"(Ooh)" You can't touch this
"(Ooh)" 'Cause I'm a bad bitch

We hit the elevator ride up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight "(love this shit tonight)"
Pull me under the flashing light
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me blow up this house tonight "(gonna blow up)"

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na na

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm Madonna

"(Bitch I'm Madonna)
(Bitch I'm Madonna)"

We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I brought a pee-wee to my show and got my freak on
The neighbors pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If that's your weapon we are gonna give a good show

I just wanna go out tonight
Pull me under the flashing light
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me blow up this house tonight "(gonna blow up)"

Hold up with my nose up
And that rose up in that thanga
I'm froze up, but my stove up
'Cause he eatin' like this his dinner

I run shit, I don't fall back
'Cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got em all struck
It's not a toss up, I'm the winner

Beep beep, bitch move
'Fore I bang bang with that Uz
That's Miu Miu on my shoes
Ain't got a thing left for me to prove

It's that bottle service all night
It's that poppin' urban just right
It's that go hard or go home zone
