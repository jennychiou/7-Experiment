Heey-i-heeeeeeeeeeeey oh yeah

Oh ou yeah yeah yeah

And the sunlight on your face
It's a memory I'll never replace
Never thought I'd have to try to let it go (go)
Now if you're gettin' on all right
I was hopin' that maybe you'd show me
What to do, how to make it through
Till I get over you
I can give
I can live a lie
Till I get over you
I can save one prayer for love
Till I get over you
I can live, I can live
Till I get over you

And I could never give enough
Couldn't save it with all my love
Watched you walk out leaving me
There wanting more (more)
Now I can't get through the night
And I'm drowning but I would be damned, babe
If you knew (if you knew) I can make it through

Till I get over you
I can give (oh)
I can live a lie
Till I get over you (till I get over you)
I can save (I can save) one prayer for love
Till I get over you
I can live, I can live, oh
Till I get over you

And the sunlight on your face
Maybe someday I will erase
But if I do
Could I make it through
Through this world without loving you, yeah, yeah
Till I get over you
I can give (I can give)
I can live a lie (I can live a lie)
Till I get over you (till I get over you)
I can save (I can save) one prayer for love
Till I get over you
I can live, I can live (oh)

Till I get over you (till I get over you)
I can give
I can live a lie (till I get over you)
Till I get over you (till I get over you)
I can save one prayer for love (one prayer for love)
Till I get over you
I can give
I can live a lie
Till I get over you
I can save one prayer for love
