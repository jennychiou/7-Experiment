Cool I am
When I am with you
Cool I'm not
When I am lonely

I feel so sad
What I did wasn't right
I feel so bad
And I must say to you

Sorry, but...

Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
What did you expect
I'm doing my best

I feel so sad
But you know I'll be true
I feel so bad
And I must say to you

Sorry, but...

Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
What did you expect?
I'm doing my best

Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
I was dishonest
I will do my best

Yeah

Cool I am
When I am with you
Cool I'm not
When I am lonely

Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
What did you expect?
I'm doing my best

Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
I was dishonest
I will do my best

Yeah

Mmm, mmm, yeah
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect
