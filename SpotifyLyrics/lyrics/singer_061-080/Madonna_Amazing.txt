You took a pretty picture
And you smashed it into bits
Sank me into blackness
And you sealed it with a kiss

If only I could let you go
Why do I need you so

It's amazing what a boy can do
I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't want you like I do
Want you and no one else

You took a poison arrow
And you aimed it at my heart
It's heavy and it's bitter
And it's tearing me apart

If only I could set you free
You worked your way inside of me

It's amazing what a boy can say
I cannot stop myself
Seems I love you more than yesterday
Love you and no one else

Oh, it's amazing

It's amazing
Oh, it's amazing

I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't
Love you and no one else
