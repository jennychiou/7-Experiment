You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
You're nobody 'til somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old

You know the world is the same, you'll never change it
Just as sure as the stars shine above
Well, you are nobody until somebody comes and loves you
So, find yourself somebody to love

I said the world, it still is the same, you'll never change it
Just as sure as the stars shine above
Good God, baby, you ain't nobody until somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody 
I have got me that body
So go out, look above and find yourself somebody to love
