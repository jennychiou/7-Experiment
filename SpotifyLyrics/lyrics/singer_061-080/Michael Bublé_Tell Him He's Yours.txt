Love the one that's right for love
Not the one you keep thinking of
Open your eyes
Take a look, let him in
Don't just let your life go by dreamin'
'Bout some other guy when you are dancin'
With him cheek to cheek

Flying around in a jet
Champagne and limos you bet!
Laughing and having some fun
Though he's not even the one

Love the one that's right for love
Not the one you keep thinking of
Open your heart
Take a chance, let him in
Don't try to say that he's not
'Cause of all the things that he's got
For he's just a guy that wants you and he'll be true

And although he just tries to explain
That all of this fun's not a game
He'll turn around and walk out that door
Just tell him he's yours!
