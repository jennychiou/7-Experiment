Just like the sea
No one possesses you
And no one can go down to
The deepest side of you

Just like a tree
Decades and memories
Articulate and seal
Every one of your dreams
When I need you I secretly sing you this part of my soul

Yeliel, my angel
Know that I can hear you
And every word you speak is holy
Wind caressing me
Yeliel, my angel
Know that I can see you
And when I fall I feel your arms around my destiny
Protecting me

I do believe
Some things are mysteries
The simple fact that we stand alive, that we breathe

Why do I love
Why do I hate and die
Where do these things all lie
I don't know why I cry
When I need you I secretly sing you this part of my soul

Why do I love
Why do I hate and die
Where do these things all lie
I don't know why I cry
When I need you I secretly sing you this part of my soul
