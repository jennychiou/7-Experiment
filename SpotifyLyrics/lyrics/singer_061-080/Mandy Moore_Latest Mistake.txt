There is part of me that wants an answer
And part of me that doesn't want to know
Part of you that I am in love with
And the part that I am willing to let go

This is a delicate unraveling
Now and then I find pieces on the floor
Tiny little bits that tell me
Maybe I shouldn't do this 
Or love you anymore

Someone's gonna have to fess up
Someone's gonna have to clean this mess up

I wanted you the first time
I loved you for the second
Don't know how that ever goes away
And as far as I can tell
You're really good at talking
I think it's time that you let me know
I'm your latest mistake

Wonder what will make you happy
I wonder what you'll do with it all
I have a map in my head
Somehow still don't understand
Why I always have to miss you
Why I have to make the call

Someone's gonna have to step up
Someone's gonna have to clean this mess up

I wanted you the first time
I loved you for the second
Don't know how that ever goes away
And as far as I can tell
You're really good at talking
I think it's time that you let me know
I'm your latest mistake

Before you drive me away
Take a good look at me, baby
Picture me not lying on your couch
Well, I wish the best for you
Everytime you go through this
Before you finally figure it out

I wanted you the first time
I loved you for the second
Don't know how that ever goes away
And as far as I can tell
You're really good at talking
I think it's time that you let me know
I'm your latest mistake
