When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I'd kept at bay
A hairline break that's taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

And pure so sure I'd struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark

See our hearts are intertwined
Then I'm free, free of mine
I'm falling free

See our hearts are intertwined
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine

When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love

And when you leave you raise the sail
And then I'm free, free to fail
I'm falling free

Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

The face of God that stands above
Pouring over hope and love
That all of might and life and limb
Could turn around and love again

When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, free to go
I'm falling free

I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free

I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free

Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
I let loose the need to know
And we're both free, free to go
