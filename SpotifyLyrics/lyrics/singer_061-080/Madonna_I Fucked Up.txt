I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way

If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back, I'd have no fear
If I took another path, things would be so different
But they're not

I coulda just kept my big mouth closed
I coulda just done what I was told
Maybe I shoulda turned silver into gold
But in front of you, I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream

I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
You wanna know how to make God laugh
Tell him your plans

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Filled it up with Warhols, it would be so cool
Coulda gone riding stallions in the country side
With a pack of Great Danes racing eye to eye

We coulda toured the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet
We coulda climbed the mountains
Seen a perfect sunlight
Written our names across the sky

We coulda gotten drunk and driven on the Autobahn
We coulda got ourselves arrested in St. Germain
We coulda lived life crazy till the day we died
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
Je suis désolé
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back maybe one day or not
