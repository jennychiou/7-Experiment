That's how it goes
When you feel so sad you feel so low
Life seems so bad I know, I know
That's how it goes

That's how it goes 
You may think it's funny
But it always shows,
Try to hide it honey, oh no, it shows.
That's how it goes

Some people say,
Everything's gonna be okay,
Just give it a while,
You'll find you're back
Back in style

But I don't know life will get better
I am sure they know,
Sooner or later it shows, I know
That's how it goes

It's funny to see how easy life can be
Just sit back and smile
You'll find that life is worthwhile
That's how it goes
When you're on top the whole world knows
Wouldn't want to stop it, oh no, it shows
That's how it goes
