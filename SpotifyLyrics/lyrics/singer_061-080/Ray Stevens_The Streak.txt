Hello, everyone, this is your Action News reporter with all the news
that is news across the nation, on the scene at the supermarket.  There
seems to have been some disturbance here.  Pardon me, sir, did you see
what happened?

Yeah, I did.  I's standin' overe there by the tomaters, and here he
come, running through the pole beans, through the fruits and vegetables,
nekkid as a jay bird!  And I hollered over t' Ethel, I said, "Don't
look, Ethel!"  But it's too late, she'd already been incensed!

Here he comes, 
(boogity boogity)
There he goes, 
(boogity boogity)
And he ain't wearin' no clothes

Oh yes, they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
Fastest thing on two feet
(boogity boogity)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He gon' give us a peek

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
He likes to show off his physique
(boogity boogity)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around
Invitin' public critique

This is your Action News reporter once again and we're here at the gas
station.  Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

Yeah, I did.  I's just in here gettin my tires checked, he just appeared
out of the traffic.  Come streakin' around the grease rack there, didn't
have nothin' on but a smile.  I looked in there, and Ethel was gettin'
her a cold drink.  I hollered, "Don't look, Ethel!"  But it was too
late.  She'd already been mooned.  Flashed her right there in front of
the shock absorbers.

He ain't rude, 
(boogity boogity)
He ain't lewd, 
(boogity boogity)
He's just in the mood to run in the nude

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
He likes to turn the other cheek
(boogity boogity)
He's always makin' the news
Wearin' just his tennis shoes
Guess you could call him unique

Once again, your Action News reporter in the booth at the gym, covering
the disturbance at the basketball playoff.  Pardon me, sir, did you see
what happened?

Yeah, I did.  Half time, I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow
cone.  And here he come, right out of the cheap seats, dribbling, right
down the middle of the court.  Didn't have on nothing but his Keds.
Made a hook shot and got out through the concessions stand.  I hollered up
at Ethel, I said, "Don't look, Ethel!"  But it was too late.  She'd
already got a free shot.  Grandstandin', right there in front of the
home team.

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
The fastest thing on two feet
(boogity boogity)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He gon' give us a peek
