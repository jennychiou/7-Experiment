I'm not stressing, not doing what I usually do
Normally I can show situations, but I don't with you
Have a history of unraveling love like a ball of yarn
All the labels and great expectations, all they do is harm

I close my eyes, overanalyze
I do, I do, I do, I do it every time
I close my eyes, overanalyze
But I don't, I don't need a word to call you mine

We don't need no labels when you're sitting 'cross the table
We're perfectly unstable
So why we need the, why we need the
Why we need the labels?
Screw the labels, screw the labels

When I'm a hurricane, you're like coming home to Malibu
When I'm broken in a million pieces, you're the crazy glue
I always rush everything, I get ahead of the beat when I sing
You're like, "Slow down, honey
'Cause we don't need to rush a thing, no"

I close my eyes, overanalyze
But I don't, I don't need a word to call you mine

We don't need no labels when you're sitting 'cross the table
We're perfectly unstable
So why we need the, why we need the
Why we need the labels?
Screw the labels, screw the labels
Screw the labels, screw the labels

Slow down, honey
'Cause we don't need to rush a thing
Need to rush a thing, need to rush a thing
Slow down, honey
'Cause we don't need to rush a thing
Need to rush a thing, I don't need to rush a thing

We don't need no labels when you're sitting 'cross the table
We're perfectly unstable
So why we need the, why we need the
Why we need the labels?
Screw the labels, screw the labels
Screw the labels, screw the labels
