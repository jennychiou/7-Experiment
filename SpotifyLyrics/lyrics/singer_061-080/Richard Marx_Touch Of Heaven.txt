Your eyes burn though me
Like a raging fire.
I fall blissfully
Every time you say just one little word.
You know it makes me crazy.

You ask way too much
When you say that I can
Look, but do not touch.
I have never wanted any other girl
The way I want you, baby.

I surrender
To what I can't control.
Drunk with desire,
I've opened up my soul.

You know I would go around the world,
I'd take you anywhere,
Oh, baby, anywhere,
For a touch of heaven.
Tell me what you want,
I'd give you anything,
Oh, baby, everything,
For a touch of heaven.

I have dreamed of this,
Your body next to mine.
Drowning in every kiss.
How I've longed to find my one and only girl,
And I've found her in you, baby.

All I ever wanted
Is everything that you are
Don't leave me longing.
You're tearing up my heart.

You know I would go around the world,
I'd take you anywhere,
Oh, baby, anywhere,
For a touch of heaven.
Tell me what you want,
I'd give you anything,
Oh, baby, everything,
For a touch of heaven.

Everyone says
You've been leading me on.
Too late for warnings,
I'm already gone.

I surrender to what I can't control.
Drunk with desire,
I'm given you my soul.

You know I would go around the world.
I'd take you anywhere,
Oh, baby, anywhere,
For a touch of heaven.
Tell me what you want,
I'd give you anything,
Oh, baby, everything,
For a touch of heaven.

I'd go around the world.
I'd take you anywhere,
Oh, baby, anywhere,
For a touch of heaven.
Tell me what you want,
I'd give you anything,
Oh, baby, everything,
For a touch of heaven.
