Now I'd just like to say a few words about taxes

I pay another man to do my taxes
On account of that's just one more deduction I can take
But you know the mailman brought my W-2 this morning
Yeah, and this year they're taking a third of all I make

Now I'm just as patriotic as the next man
And you know I love that red white and blue
So I'm gonna help to pay this rising cost of freedom
But I'll be danged if I'm gonna change my point of view

'Cause every time the bureaucrats run out of money
Congress socks it to the working man
And I don't think it's one bit funny
How they take so much of my money
And do things with it I don't understand

I don't know why they think they've got to squeeze us
But I'll tell you just exactly where I stand
I believe that ten percent is good enough for Jesus
Well, it oughta be enough for Uncle Sam

Now some of these folks that we've been sending off to Congress
Think that all they've got to do is just spend and spend, huh
But you know you can't run a family much less a country
With more money going out than coming in

Yeah, and that old debt just keeps on getting bigger
And we all gonna have to pay so don't you laugh
'Cause pretty soon we might just look down at our paychecks
And figure out that they done started taking half

'Cause every time the bureaucrats run out of money
Congress socks it to the working man
And I don't think it's one bit funny
How they take so much of my money
And do things with it I don't understand

I don't know why they think they've got to squeeze us
But I'll tell you just exactly where I stand
I believe if ten percent is good enough for Jesus
Well, it oughta be enough for Uncle Sam

I said, if ten percent is good enough for Jesus
Well, it oughta be enough
You know times are getting tough
And it oughta be enough for Uncle Sam
