She may be weary
Women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary
Try a little tenderness

Uuh she may be waiting
Just anticipating
Things she may never possess
And while she's without them
Try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental
She has her grief
And her care
But a word 
So soft and gentle
Makes it easier
To bear

You won't regret it 
Women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy
Try a little tenderness

But a word
Soft and gentle 
Makes it easier 
To bear

You won't regret it
Women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy
Just try a little tenderness
You've gotta try

You've gotta hold her
You've got to sceeze her
You have to try
You've got to try
And always please her

You won't regret it
You won't regret it
Oh, try a little tenderness
