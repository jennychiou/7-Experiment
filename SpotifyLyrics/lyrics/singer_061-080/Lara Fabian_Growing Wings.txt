Have you ever faced an ocean
Though you hadn't any notion
How to swim but you jumped in anyway
Have you ever kissed a lover
Knowing that his heart was broken
And damaged but you held him anyway

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground

Have you wandered in the desert
While the sands were ever changing
But the winds guide you anyway
Have you spoken in a language
That you've never heard before
But your memory understands it anyway

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
I'm growing wings now...
I'm growing wings now...

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
