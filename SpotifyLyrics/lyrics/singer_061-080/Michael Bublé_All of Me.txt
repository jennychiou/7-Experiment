All of me, why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you

Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

Your goodbyes, they left me with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not why not take all of me

Let's go boys.
