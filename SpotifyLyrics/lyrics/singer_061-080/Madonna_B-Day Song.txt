And the beat goes on
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song
In my happy world

I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
Huh!

And the beat goes on "(and the beat goes on)"
I'm a happy girl "(I'm a happy girl)"
It's my birthday song "(oh yeah, it's my birthday)"
In my happy world "(in my happy world)"

Light my candles, gotta make a wish
Wrap up the present and seal it with a kiss
Gimme a spanking, start the day off right
'Cause it's my day, you're gonna sing my song tonight

And the beat goes on "(and the beat goes on)"
I'm a happy girl "(I'm a happy girl)"
It's my birthday song "(oh yeah, it's my birthday)"
In my happy world "(in my happy world)"

I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl "(I'm a happy girl)"

My type of party, there's no hangover
So grab your things you better come over
We get high and we are still stay sober
We throw it down and then we gonna start over
My type of party, there's no hangover

And the beat goes on "(and the beat goes on)"
I'm a happy girl "(I'm a happy girl)"
It's my birthday song "(oh yeah, it's my birthday)"
In my happy world "(in my happy world)"

I want a diamond, don't give me a fake "(That's what I said)"
I'll let you lick the frosting off my cake
Gimme a spanking, start the day off right
'Cause it's my birthday, you'll be singing my song tonight

And the beat goes on "(Na na na na, na na na na na)"
I'm a happy girl "(Na na na na, na na na na na)"
It's my birthday song "(Na na na na, na na na na na)"
In my happy world "(Na na na na, na na na na na)"

I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl 
In my happy world

I know it's gonna be a good day
Oh yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday everyday

Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
"(Gonna sing my song tonight)"
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
"(Gonna sing my song tonight)"

Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
"(Gonna sing my song tonight)"
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na na
"(Gonna sing my song tonight)"

Happy birthday!
