I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey!
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Woah, woah
Ahh, woah

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel I've nothin' to hide

Like a virgin, hey!
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ooh baby, yeah

Can't you hear my heart beat?
For the very first time
