Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner 
So baby, won't you set me free?

Stop playing with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Keep on pushing me, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms 
You love me till I just can't see

But then you let me down
When I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away
I just wanna stay
There's something I just got to say

Just try to understand
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Keep on pushing me, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Look what your love has done to me
Come on baby, set me free
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

You cause me so much pain
I think I'm going insane
What does it take to make you see?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Keep pushing me, keep pushing me
Keep pushing my love
(Keep on pushing my love over the borderline, borderline)
Come on baby, come on darling, yeah

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da...
