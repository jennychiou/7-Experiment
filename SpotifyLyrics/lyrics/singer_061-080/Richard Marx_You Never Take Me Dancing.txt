The world's greatest mystery
Is love between the woman and the man
Some guys are Romeos
Others simply do the best they can

I'm just your average, ordinary Joe
Tryin' to learn things I never knew I had to know

What's a man supposed to do
I don't get no kick from nine to five
And I'm not a man who thinks it's true
It's a woman's place to keep a love alive
I've watched enough daytime TV
To know my baby's needs
But sometimes I swear that's she's impossible to please
She says

You give me all that I want of your money, baby
But you never take me dancing

I really think I do a lot to show
How I feel about her in my way
Roses on our anniversary
Candlelight and me on her birthday
Just when I thought that I had it all worked out
Now she says I still don't know what it's all about
She says

You give me all that I want of your money, baby
But you never take me dancing
You give me sweet little talk, call me honey, baby
Bu you never take me dancing
I'm just your average, ordinary Joe
Tryin' to learn things I never knew I had to know

Chorus out
