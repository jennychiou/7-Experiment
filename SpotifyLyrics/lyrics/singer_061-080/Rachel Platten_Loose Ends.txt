I don't wanna blow your cover, love
I don't wanna beat each other up
I don't wanna fight, that won't make it right
Though I'd love to throw some uppercuts
Haven't seen you in a couple months
Got a lot of nerve, just showing up
Saying you regret how you left a mess
Go and tell it to your other love

Who told you you could put band-aids
Over broken hearts to fix messes you made?

You can't tie up your loose ends
'Cause I know what you're doing
And your sorrys are too little and too late
So go fool all your new friends
Who don't know where you've been
But don't ask me to pretend that we're okay
There's no tying up your loose ends, your loose ends
No tying up your loose ends, your loose ends

Much as I would love forgiving you
Much as I wish what you're saying's true
It's nice to finally hear, but it's pretty clear
Motions are all that you're going through

(Who) Who told you you could put band-aids
Over broken hearts to fix messes you made?

You can't tie up your loose ends
'Cause I know what you're doing
And your sorrys are too little and too late (it's too late)
So go fool all your new friends
Who don't know where you've been
But don't ask me to pretend that we're okay
There's no tying up your loose ends, your loose ends
No tying up your loose ends, your loose ends

Yeah, that's the way you lose friends, you lose them
And you run out of excuses, you lose them, hey-ey-ey
Who told you you could put band-aids
Over broken hearts to fix messes you made?
No "Hey, how have you been?"
Not after what you did
Your sorry's are too little and too late

You can't tie up your loose ends
'Cause I know what you're doing
And your sorrys are too little and too late (it's too late)
So go fool all your new friends
Who don't know where you've been
But don't ask me to pretend that we're okay (we're okay)
There's no tying up your loose ends
No tying up your loose ends
Yeah, 'cause your sorrys are too little and too late
No tying up your loose ends
Yeah, that's the way you lose friends
So don't ask me to pretend that we're okay
There's no tying up your loose ends, your loose ends
No tying up your loose ends, your loose ends
