I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some, somebody twice as smart as I
A somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Leave you to line that misery lost company
Wait and see
I, I, I, I wanna be there
To see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there and applaud it
From a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you broke mine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
And I'll sit there and applaud it
From a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, it's gonna break your heart
Just like you broke mine
