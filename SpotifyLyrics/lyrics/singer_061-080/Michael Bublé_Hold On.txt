Didn't they always say, we were the lucky ones
I guess that we were once
Babe we were once

But luck will leave you cause it is a faithlees friend
And, in the end
When life has got you down
You've got someone here that you can wrap your arms around

So hold on, to me tight
Hold on, to me tonight
We are stronger here together
Than we could ever be alone
So hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go hmmm

There's a thousand ways for things to fall apart
But it's no one's fault
No, it's not our fault

Maybe all the plans we made, might not work out
But I have no doubt
Even though its hard to see
I've got faith in us
And I believe in you and me

So hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it'll be all right
'Cause it's you and me together
And baby all we've got is time
So hold on to me
Hold on to me tonight

There's so many dreams that we have given up
Take a look, at all we've got
And with this kind of love
What we've got here is enough

So, hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it'll be all right
'Cause we are stronger here together
Then we could ever be alone
Just hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go

Hold on to me, it's gonna be all right
Hold on to me, tonight

Didn't they always said we were the lucky ones
