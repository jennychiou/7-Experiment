I should've seen the sign, way back then
When she told me, that you, were her best friend
And now she's rollin', rollin', rollin'
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressin' like me and talkin' like me, it freaked me out
She started callin' you up in the middle of the night, what's that about

I just wanna be there, when you discover
You wake up in the mornin', next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment, 'cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me, she doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have, it won't be the same (it won't be the same)

I should've seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
And she was stealin', stealin', stealin'
And now you're feelin', feelin', feelin'
She started dyin' her hair and wearin' the same perfume as me
She started readin' my books and stealin' my looks and lingerie

I just wanna be there, when you discover
You wake up in the mornin', next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast and love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary, 'cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me, she doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have, it won't be the same (it won't be the same)

She is lickin' her lips and she's battin' her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh, devoted for life, make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time, I guarantee you will find
She's not me
I know I can do it better

If someone wants to pimp your style and hang with you a little while
And make up for the things you lack, you're gonna have to watch... (your back)

She's not me, she doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have, it won't be the same (it won't be the same)

Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me and she never will be
Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me and she never will be

Gotta funny way to show your feelin's
I guess it was some bullshit sayin' you love me, love me
Guess my expectation hit the ceilin', uh
When you come back, it could cost, just trust me, trust me
Wendy

She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be (she never will be)
Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be

Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me and she never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me, never will be, never will be

She's not me and she never will be, she never will be
