I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can pretend to be someone else

You'll always love me more miles away
I hear it in your voice when you're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best, we were miles away

So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

When no one's around and I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You'll always have the biggest heart, when we're 6,000 miles apart

Too much of no sound, uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough, when it's long distance love

You'll always love me more miles away
I hear it in your voice when you're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best, we were miles away

So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

I'm alright, don't be sorry but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize 
That I'm the best thing to happen to you

You'll always love me more miles away
I hear it in your voice when you're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best, we were miles away

You'll always love me more miles away
I hear it in your voice when you're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best, we were miles away

So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away...
