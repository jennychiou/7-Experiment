"Yeah baby, ha ha ha ha
Hello, Austin
Hey Basil, how are you?
We need your help. Someone is seducing our top agents

As you can see, she's a master of disguise
Hoo hoo hoo hoo, oh
But Austin, whatever you do, don't fall in love. We've already lost 007 and 008
Well then, Basil, this looks like a case for double-oh behave!"

Haven't we met?
You're some kind of beautiful stranger
You could be good for me
I've had the taste for danger

If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Heaven forbid
I'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger

I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song

To know you is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows

To love you is to be part of you
I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pride

Da da-da-dum da-dum da-dum da da da-da dum
Beautiful stranger
Da da-da-dum da-dum da-dum da da da-da dum
Beautiful stranger

If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Haven't you heard?
I fell in love with a beautiful stranger

I looked into your face
My heart was dancing all over the place
I'd like to change my point of view
If I could just forget about you

To know you is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows

I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song to you

To know you is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows

I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pride

Da da-da-dum da-dum da-dum da da da-da dum
Beautiful stranger
Da da-da-dum da-dum da-dum da da da-da dum
Beautiful stranger
