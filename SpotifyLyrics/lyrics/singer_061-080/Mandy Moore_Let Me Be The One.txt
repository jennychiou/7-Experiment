Let me be
Let me be
Baby let me be the only one
Baby let me be the only one
Let me be the one
You give your love to (the only one)
You give your love to (the only one)

I hear your records on the radio
I see you talking on the late, late show
Every girl wants to be your friend
Don't you know you're always on my mind?
How I missed you since you hit the big time...
You hurt me
I just can't pretend

We used to be together
Making dreams
Making plans (ah)
You left that world behind
Now I'm asking you... wont you?

Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one you need, baby baby)
Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one that gives you lovin', oh oh)

Let me be, Let me be
Baby, Let me be the only one

I see the sadness in your eyes
Don't you get lonely for me, sometimes?
Lonely for... the love that we had
I'll be waiting when that day comes
You need somebody
Won't you let me the one?
Come to me
Put yourself in my hands
Oh

We use to be together
Making dreams
Making plans
You left that world behind
Now I'm asking you... wont you?

Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one you need, baby baby)
Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one that gives you lovin', oh oh)

We use to be together
Making dreams
Making plans
You left that world behind
Now I'm asking you... wont you?

Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one you need, baby baby)
Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one that gives you lovin', oh oh)

Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one you need, baby baby)
Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to (the one that gives you lovin', oh oh)

Let me be
Let me be
Baby let me be the only one
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
