Drove to a house in the hills where I wanted to be
The lights were all on and I knew you were waiting for me
And that road became familiar
Like a mystery shape of your heart

And I know
You love me in your way
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days
And I'm fine
But I'm not okay
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days

The fog in the morning that clouded the world that we knew
It was almost enough being lonely and living for you
And the rain came to our window
And I wish I could've stayed

And I know
You love me in your way
(You love me in your way)
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days
And I'm fine
But I'm not okay
(I'm fine, but I'm not okay)
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days

Let it go
Let it go, sunshine
Now you know
Now you know its time
It's time

You were asleep while I gathered my things in the dark
The burns on my fingers were all that was left of the spark
I didn't want to wake you
'Cause I knew I couldn't say

That I know
You love me in your way
(You love me in your way)
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days
And I'm fine
But I'm not okay
(I'm fine, but I'm not okay)
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days
I'm looking forward to looking back on these days
