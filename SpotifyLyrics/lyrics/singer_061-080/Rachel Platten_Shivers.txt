Gold green eyes
You, you see me in the perfect light
And, and even for the thousandth time
Ay, your hands can make my skin light up like diamonds
(Yeah, you do)

Maybe, it's chemical
Something about you really drives me crazy
Maybe, it's magical
It could be the stars above are all to blame
I get emotional knowing you never ever try to change me
'Cause you know who I am, goddamn

You're giving me shivers (Yeah, you do)
Running up through my spine
Giving me shivers (Yeah, you do)
You're making me lose my mind
Always deliver (Ooh, baby, baby)
You know my triggers (Ooh, baby, baby)
So just do what you do, what you do
Make my body shiver

Perfect fit like, like my name on your pillow lips
It, it's like a thousand ego trips
I, I'm dying to go anywhere you take me
(Yeah, you do)

Maybe, it's chemical
Something about you really drives me crazy
Maybe, it's magical
It could be the stars above are all to blame
I get emotional knowing you never ever try to change me
'Cause you know who I am, goddamn

You're giving me shivers (Yeah, you do)
Running up through my spine
Giving me shivers (Yeah, you do)
You're making me lose my mind
Always deliver (Ooh, baby, baby)
You know my triggers (Ooh, baby, baby)
So just do what you do, what you do
Make my body shiver

You're giving me shivers, running up through my spine
Giving me shivers, you're making me lose my mind
Always deliver (Ooh, baby, baby)
You know my triggers (Ooh, baby, baby)
So just do what you do, what you do
I love the way you make me
Shiver (Yeah, you do)
Running up through my spine
Giving me shivers (Yeah, you do)
You're making me lose my mind
Always deliver (Ooh, baby, baby)
You know my triggers (Ooh, baby, baby)
So just do what you do, what you do
Make my body shiver
Do what you do, what you do
Make my body shiver
Do what you do, what you do
I love the way you make me
