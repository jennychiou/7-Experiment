What can you lose?
Only the blues
Why keep concealing
Everything your feeling
Say it to her, what can you lose?

Maybe it shows
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore
Maybe though she knows
And just wants to go on as before
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

Well if she does
Those are the do's
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still you love her
What can you lose?

But what if she goes
At least now you have part of her
What if she had to choose?

Leave it alone
Hold it all in
Better a bone, don't even begin
With so much to win...
There's too much to lose...
