I,
Love to love you,
I,

Love to love you,

Some boys are full of noise,
But boy you've caught my ear,
Wanna see if you've got something to say.

No lies or alibis
The nonsense stops here,
Be my friend you can be on your way.

Play it smart boy,
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
If you wanna reach me,
Touch my heart boy,
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
'Cause that's how to please me...

What you want,
I can be,
I'm the girl of your fantasy,
As long as you love me
(As long as you love me)

What you want
I can do (I can do),
All I ask of you (oh owwww),
Is baby you love me.

Some boys want pretty toys,
But I'm so much more,
Can't you see that I'm a girl you can trust?
Get real with how you feel,
Or I'm out that door,
Is it love or is it only a crush?

Listen up boy,
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
And stop talking smack now,
Back it up boy,
(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?)
Boy step off that track now.

What you want,
I can be,
I'm the girl of your fantasy,
As long as you love me
(As long as you love me)

What you want
I can do (I can do),
All I ask of you (oh owwww),
Is baby you love me.

What you want,
I can be,
I'm the girl of your fantasy,
As long as you love me
(As long as you love me)

What you want
I can do (I can do),
All I ask of you (oh owwww),
Is baby you love me.

I,
Love to love you,
Oh,
Love,
Is this love?
Does it fall from heaven above?
Do you feel it boy?
Can you feel me boy?

"spoken:"
I know it's not right
I know it's not wrong
But right here right now
Is where I belong

What you want,
I can be,
I'm the girl of your fantasy,
As long as you love me
(As long as you love me)

What you want
I can do (I can do),
All I ask of you (oh owwww),
Is baby you love me.

What you want,
I can be,
I'm the girl of your fantasy,
As long as you love me
(As long as you love me)
