I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly
I want to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I want to save his life

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

Sometimes it's such a pleasure
Sometimes I wanna tear it all down
It's easy to be lazy
And hard to go away from the crowd

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
We'll never be the same

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

In the blink of an eye everything could change
Say hello to your life now your living 
This is it from now on
It's a brand new day
It was time to wake up from this dream (from this dream)

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
You'll never be the same
And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together

And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here
