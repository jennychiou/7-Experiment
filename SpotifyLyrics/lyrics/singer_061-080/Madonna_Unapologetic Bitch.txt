Woke up this morning feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it, then you let it go
See you tried to call me, but I blocked you on my phone

It took a minute, but right now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you say it that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you

It might sound like I'm a
It might sound like I'm a

I know you'd like it if I sat at home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded you were never on my side

I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, did it, love it, hate it, I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored?

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you

It might sound like I'm a
It might sound like I'm a

Yeah, woah
Yeah, woah
Yeah, woah
Yeah, woah
It might sound like I'm a
It might sound like I'm a

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

It might sound like I'm a
It might sound like I'm a
