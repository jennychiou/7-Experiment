Cause I use to live
In a fuzzy dream
And I wanted to be
Like all the pretty people
I'm so stupid
'Cause I use to live
In a fuzzy dream
And I use to believe
In a pretty pictures
That were all around me
But now I know for sure
That I was stupid

Please don't try to tempt me
It was just greed
And it won't protect me
Don't want my dreams
Adding up to nothing
I was just looking for
Everybody's looking for something

I'm so stupid
'Cause I use to live
In a tiny bubble
And I wanted to be
Like all the pretty people
That were all around me
But now I know for sure
That I was stupid
Stupider than stupid

Stupider than stupid
Stupider than stupid

Please don't try to tempt me
It was just greed
And it won't protect me
Don't want my dreams
Adding up to nothing
I was just looking for
Everybody's looking for something

Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody, everybody

Please don't try to tempt me
It was just greed
And it won't protect me
Don't want my dreams
Adding up to nothing
I was just looking for
Everybody's looking for something
