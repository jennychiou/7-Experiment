Cherish, cherish

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I'll take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance

You are my destiny 
I can't let go
Baby, can't you see?
Cupid please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
(Oh baby I) cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
(I'm always singing it)

Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good 
(And baby I) perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side 
(Oh baby I) cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
(I'm always singing it)

Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good 
(And baby I) perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

Who? You! Can't get away I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

(You're giving it, you're giving it to me, boy
Keep giving me all, all, all of your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you)

Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
