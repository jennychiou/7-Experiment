Seems I've played the game for much too long
I let people buy my love and I
Never got to sing my songs for you.

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose.
In the game of love you pay your dues.

Say that happiness cannot be measured,
And a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures.
What a joke.

I was not your woman, I was not your friend,
But you gave me something to remember.
No other man said love yourself
Nobody else can.
We weren't meant to be,
At least not in this lifetime,
But you gave me something to remember.
I hear you still say, "Love yourself".

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose.
In the game of love I've paid my dues.

Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun,
Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather.
What a shame, who's to blame?
