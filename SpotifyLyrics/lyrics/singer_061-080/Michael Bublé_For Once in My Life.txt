For once in my life
I've got someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Could make my dreams come true

For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once I have someone
I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I've got love I can make it
For once in my life
I've got someone who needs me

At least for once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I've got love I can make it
For once in my life
I've got someone
For once in my life
I find someone
For once in my life
I've got someone who needs me
