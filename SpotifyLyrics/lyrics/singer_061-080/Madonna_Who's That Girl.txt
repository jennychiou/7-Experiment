"Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?"

When you see her, say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word, get closer to the fire
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning 'round and 'round
You can't get off, you try but you can't

Quien es esa niña "(Who's that girl?)"
Señorita mas fina "(Who's that girl?)"
Quien es esa niña "(Who's that girl?)"
Señorita mas fina "(Who's that girl?)"

You try to avoid her, fate is in your hands
She's smiling, an invitation to the dance
Her heart is on the street, tu corazon es suyo
Now you're falling at her feet
You try to get away but you can't

Quien es esa niña "(Who's that girl?)"
Señorita mas fina "(Who's that girl?)"
Quien es esa niña "(Who's that girl?)"
Señorita mas fina "(Who's that girl?)"

Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now

Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning 'round and 'round
You can't get off, you try but you can't

Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now
Who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?
