The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there touched your hair
And walked with me

All summer long
We sang a song
Then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights
Went flying by
The world was new
Beneath a blue
Umbrella sky

Then softer than
A piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and gone
But still those days
Those lonely days
Go on and on
But guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and gone
But still those days
Those lonely days
Go on and on
But guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind

Mmm... that summer wind.
Warm warm summer wind
Mmm... that summer wind.
