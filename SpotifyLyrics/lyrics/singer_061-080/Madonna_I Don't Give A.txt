I don’t give a fu-u-u-u
I don’t give a fu-u-u-u
I don’t give a fu-u-u-u
I don’t give a fu-u-u-u

Wake up ex-wife
This is your life
Children on your own
Turning on the telephone

Messengers, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multi-task

Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy
I forgot the password

Gotta call the babysitter
Tweetin' on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right

I'm moving fast, can you follow my track
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

You were so mad at me
Who's got custody
Lawyers suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup

Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress

Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs

Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the biters have to go
Standing in the front row

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right

I'm moving fast, can you follow my track
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself
And I swallowed my light

I tried to become all
That you expect of me
And if it was a failure
I don't give a

I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u

[Nicki Minaj]
Shots fire
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire
You don't hear them bums on nothin' that's fire
Tell 'em catch buyer
In the Bugatti ten grand, one tire

Hey yo Madonna, maybe I say you original don dada
In that yeah Gabbana and the, ah yeah, Prada
We [[Madonna:Material Girl|material girls]] ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar

See I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss

Yo, I don't give a, F you
Curse nor bless you, never let 'em stress you
Yo I ain't a businesswoman
I'm a business, woman
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman, yeah

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be all right
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast
Can you follow my track
I'm moving fast
And I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

[Nicki Minaj]
There's only one Queen
And that's Madonna...bitch!

I don't give a (×16)
