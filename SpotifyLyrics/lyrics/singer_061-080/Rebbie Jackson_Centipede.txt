Centipede
Centipede

Your love is like a raging fire
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire

I feel, oh, yeah, a longin' for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Just like a centipede, you've got
A lot of lovin' to touch
Don't you know...

In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears
Now you're crawlin' like a centipede

Centipede

You came to strike him with your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To bite him with your love
But like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Just like a centipede you've got
A lot of lovin' to touch
Don't you know...

In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears
Now you're crawlin' like a centipede

Centipede

(Verse in extended version)
Your heart is full of strange desire
You're the heat of a summer's night
A centipede on fire
When the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire
Like a beast about to strike
The centipede's on fire
Don't you know...

In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears

In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears
Now you're crawlin' like a centipede
