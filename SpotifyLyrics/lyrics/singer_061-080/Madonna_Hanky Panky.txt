Come over here!

Some girls, they like candy,
And others, they like to grind,
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind.

Treat me like I'm a bad girl,
Even when I'm being good to you,
I don't want you to thank me,
You can just spank me. Mmm.

Some guys like to sweet talk,
And others, they like to tease,
Tie my hands behind my back and,
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy.

Don't slobber me with kisses,
I can get that from my sisters,
Before I get too cranky, you better...

Like hanky panky
Nothing like a good spanky
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky.

Like hanky panky
Nothing like a good spanky
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky guy.

Please don't call a doctor
'Cause there's nothing wrong with me,
I just like things a little rough
And you better not disagree.

'Cause I don't like a big softie, (no)
I like someone mean and bossy,
Let me speak to you frankly, you better...

Like hanky panky
Nothing like a good spanky
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky.

Like hanky panky
Nothing like a good spanky
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky guy.

Ooh, yeah.

What about? Yeah. That's an interesting...
My bottom hurts just thinking about it.

(She wants you to) Treat me like I'm a bad girl,
(She needs you to) Even when I'm being good to you.
I don't want you to thank me (don't thank her), you better...

Like hanky panky
Nothing like a good spanky
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky.

Like hanky panky

(Hanky panky) Ooh, yeah
(Good spanky) Get the picture?
(Don't wanna cry, I just wanna)

That's the way I came into this world,
The doctor said, "Lady, she's a beautiful girl."
He gave me a spanky and I started to smile,
So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it.
Yeah.
(Hanky panky, good spanky, don't wanna cry, I just wanna)
