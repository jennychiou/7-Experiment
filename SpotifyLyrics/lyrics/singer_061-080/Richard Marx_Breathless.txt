Never knew love before.
Never dreamed there could be something more.
Felt my heart overflow
With the danger of needing you so.
It's a mystery I can't explain,
But I shiver when I hear your name.

You are the fire,
Every desire.
Breathless we fall in love.
Love is the answer,
We are the dancers.
Breathless we fall in love,
We fall in love.

You've crept into my soul,
And I'm ready to lose all control,
Let our hearts fill with light.
Every movement you make is so right.
It's a mystery I can't explain,
But I shiver when I hear your name.

No need to worry,
No need fo hurry.
Breathless we fall in love.
Love is the answer,
We are the dancers.
Breathless we fall in love.
We fall in love.

It's a mystery I can't explain,
But I shiver when I hear your name.
