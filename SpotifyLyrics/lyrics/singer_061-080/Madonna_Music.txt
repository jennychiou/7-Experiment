Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby

Do you like to boogie woogie

Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music, music, music, music
Music, music, music, music, music

Music makes the people come together
Music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Don't think of yesterday, and I don't look at the clock

It's like riding on the wind, and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day

Music makes the people come together, yeah
Music mix the bourgeoisie and rebel
