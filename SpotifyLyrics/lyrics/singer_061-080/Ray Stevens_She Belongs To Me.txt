She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime, paint the daytime black

You can start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees
You can start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees
But you'll wind up peeking through her keyhole on your knees

She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall
No, she never stumbles, she's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all

Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween, buy her a trumpet, for Christmas, give her a drum
