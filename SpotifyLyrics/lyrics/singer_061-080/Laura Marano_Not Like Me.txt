Take a chance
Take my hand
Maybe make it more than a glance

Loss of words
Where do we begin
Maybe introduce me to your girlfriend

Call a car
So we can talk
She can drive, and we can walk

She seems nice
You got good taste
It's so not like me to get in the way

I know I don't
Know what I'm doing
Pulse beating a light year a minute

Sparks fly and I'm
Electrocuted
So not like me to do this

My heart don't have a clock
So it can't tell when the timing's off
I know it's not very likely
But not trying is not really like me

Woah oh oh oh oh oh
It's so not like me
Woah oh oh oh

We're alone
Let's take it slow
Take some time to get to know

Who I am
And where I stand
All my past and all my plans

Your stupid charm
Shows who you are
You don't wanna break my heart

Before we start
Something's gotta end
Mister, you don't wanna meet my boyfriend

I know I don't
Know what I'm doing
Pulse beating a light year a minute

Sparks fly and I'm
Electrocuted
So not like me to do this

My heart don't have a clock
So it can't tell when the timing's off
I know it's not very likely
But not trying is not really like me

Woah oh oh oh oh oh
It's so not like me
Woah oh oh oh

Just breathe and let it go
Forget the obstacles
So you know, this is so not like me

This is not a game
It doesn't happen everyday
I really hope that you don't not like me

I know I don't
Know what I'm doing
Pulse beating a light year a minute

Sparks fly and I'm
Electrocuted
So not like me to do this

My heart don't have a clock
So it can't tell when the timing's off
I know it's not very likely
But not trying is not really like me

Woah oh oh oh oh oh
It's so not like me
Woah oh oh oh

Take a chance
Take my hand
Maybe make it more than a glance

Loss of words
Where do we begin
Maybe you could make me your girlfriend
