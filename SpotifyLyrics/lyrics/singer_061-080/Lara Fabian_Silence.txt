Silence

I've learned so much
After these years of despair
And nothing intouched
With the deepest side of my pain
Although I can't say
There's nothing there
Not even a dream to share

Are you familiar?
Or should I show you around?
It's a cold room
With nothing inside
Not a sound
But to be amazed What stillnesss can do
It will bring you back to you

Silence (Silence)
Is the moment between everyone
Is the best friend you have in the world
That moment in time
Will help you to survive
Silence
Now that you've seen it
You don't need to go back at all
And when you feel that
Cold room inside
Stand tall
You will embrace it
As you recall
It made you stronger after all

Silence (Silence) Is the moment between everyone
Is the best friend you have in the world
That moment in time
Will help you to survive
Silence
Silence
Let your consciousness finally be heard
It's unconscious
But you'll hear the burst
The voice inside will bring you back to life

(Silence, silence)
It's the moment in time
(Silence, silence)
Silence (Silence, silence)
Let it be
