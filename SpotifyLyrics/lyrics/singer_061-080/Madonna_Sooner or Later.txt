Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you faced it
I always get my man

Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter
Let's settle the matter
Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe
The challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe
The more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe
Ever fights me again
If you're on my list
It's just a question of when
When I get a yen
Then, baby, amen
I'm counting to ten
And then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you and you all alone
Sooner is better than later, but lover
I'll hover, I'll plan

This time I'm not only getting, I'm holding my man
