Look in these eyes you'll see the dark
That little space inside my heart
The darkest side withholds the light
The light that brightens me inside

You don't know

Angels don't fly, they have no wings
It is another of those things
That we make up
That we believe
The real thing is not what we conceive

You don't know
I won't let you see me
I will hide, I will lie
As true as can be
You just don't have
What it would take
To be a part of me
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart

The darkest side witholds the light
The light that shines
You can't deny

These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
