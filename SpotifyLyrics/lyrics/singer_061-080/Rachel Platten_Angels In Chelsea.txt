Last night I saw a suit give a buck to a bum
Twenty feet down the street, someone yelling, look up
Some girl, maybe 18, probably drunk
Just in time, out the way of a bus

And maybe things are finally getting better, better
Maybe everyone is finally fed up enough
Maybe all the clouds are gonna let up, let up
Oh ee oh ee oh

Brown bags, sky high, I see angels in Chelsea
Wall Street, chic life, I see angels in Chelsea
Lost souls pass by through the chain link and concrete
And everywhere I look tonight, I see angels around me
And everywhere I look tonight, I see angels in Chelsea

Spring Street, hear a busker singing the blues
'Bout peace in the world and some money for food
And little kid says, "I'm gonna be like you
A superstar, and I'mma make a difference too
And I'mma make a difference too"

And maybe things are finally getting better, better
Maybe everyone is finally fed up enough
Maybe all the clouds are gonna let up, let up
Oh ee oh ee oh

Brown bags, sky high, I see angels in Chelsea
Wall Street, chic life, I see angels in Chelsea
Lost souls pass by through the chain link and concrete
And everywhere I look tonight, I see angels around me
And everywhere I look tonight, I see angels in Chelsea

"(Angels in Chelsea)"

Subway, saw a woman in a beautiful dress
Head down in her hands, makeup a mess
Young mom, two kids, holes in their shoes
Says I've been there too and you're gonna get through
Yeah, I've been there too and you're gonna get through

Brown bags, sky high, I see angels in Chelsea
Wall Street, chic life, I see angels in Chelsea
Lost souls pass by through the chain link and concrete
And everywhere I look tonight, I see angels around me
And everywhere I look tonight, I see angels in Chelsea

I see packing in the cross streets
I see angels in Chelsea
I see angels around me
All these angels in Chelsea
All these angels around me
All these angels around me
I see angels in Chelsea
