Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry
Wondering what in the world did I do

Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying
And crazy for trying
And I'm crazy for loving you

Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying
And crazy for trying
And I'm crazy for loving you
