Do I, do I, do I
Do I, do I, do I
Do I, do I, do I
Do I, do I, do I

You, you know that I done bad things
In my didn't-know-a-thing phase
I'm not sure sometimes that I've changed
And you know all that, still you stay
I don't know if I'm deserving
Of how unconditionally
You just love me and accept me
You know all that, still you stay

Any reasonable person would've left by now
But you, you're holding me after everything you found out

You saw my wild ways
Stuck around through my ugly days
I know you mean everything you say
So why do I feel like I'm fooling you?
You saw my wild ways
Stuck around through my ugly days
I know you mean everything you say
So why do I feel like I'm fooling you?
(Why do I feel like I'm fooling?
Why do I feel like I'm fooling?
Why do I feel like I'm fooling you?)

Seems I might've kicked the habit of not letting in the magic
Because, after all, we have this, yeah
Yeah yeah, you are loving me
I, I know it isn't easy when the weakest part of me preys
On the good that you and me made, oh
But here you are, still you stay

Any reasonable person would've left by now
But you, you're holding me after everything you found out

You saw my wild ways
Stuck around through my ugly days
I know you mean everything you say
So why do I feel like I'm fooling you?
You saw my wild ways
Stuck around through my ugly days
I know you mean everything you say
So why do I feel like I'm fooling you?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I feel like I'm fooling you

Or maybe it's just hard for me to see
Yeah, all the good you say you see in me
And I wish I, I wish I could believe it, too
But I feel like I'm fooling you
(Why do I feel like I'm fooling?
Why do I feel like I'm fooling?
Why do I feel like I'm fooling you?)

You saw my wild ways
Stuck around through my ugly days
I know you mean everything you say
So why do I feel like I'm fooling you?
You saw my wild ways
Stuck around through my ugly days
I know you mean everything you say
So why do I feel like I'm fooling you?
Ooh, ooh
Feel like I'm fooling you
Ooh, I feel like I'm fooling you
