"'Nana"'
Hi, Rachel, just wanted to say hi
And I hope everything's going well for you
And you're have, having a good time in New York?
So, sorry I missed you
If you get a chance, sweetie, call me

You were early every weekday to take me home
Your car was always the closest to Washington Road
Like a blanket, I was wrapped in your arms, so warm
They say Boston's the coldest, but I wouldn't know

There was no falling down without you 'round to pick me up
And no tears that fell without your help to change my luck
And you taught me so much, I could not learn fast enough
About how to love someone wholeheartedly

You soldiered storms that you never spoke of
Built up a world that was all about us
If I close my eyes, I can still feel your touch
The warm, steady shake of two hands
That love me too much, that love me too much

You took over for your family at just 16
Putting words onto paper, working tirelessly
You said, "Your life should just be easy, love
I've worked enough for all of us
Just smile and shoot for stars above and breathe"

'Cause there was no falling down
Without you 'round to pick me up
And no tears that fell without your help to dry them up
You taught me so much, I could not learn fast enough
About how to love someone wholeheartedly

You soldiered storms that you never spoke of
Built up a world that was all about us
If I close my eyes, I can still feel your touch
The warm, steady shake of two hands
That love me too much, that love me too much

Can I hold your, can I hold your hand forever
And never let it go? I might never let it go
And can I ask you, can I ask you everything
That I ever want to know?
And, Nana, can you show me how to

Soldier big storms and not ever give up?
And build up a world that is all about love?
And not close my eyes when the water gets rough?
To have warm steady hands just like you
That love me too much, that love me too much
That I'm worthy of, that love me too much

"'Rachel & "Nana""'
That love me too much
"It was so nice to see you at my party
And having you sit with me, and we were so close"
That I'm worthy of
"And you were singing the song, I'm so excited"
That love me too much
"So anyway, honey, I love you so much
Okay, now it's goodbye"
