I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realise he's there when I turn the light off
And turn over

Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon

And suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love's to eternity

Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
Ooh he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes

He's very understanding
And he's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late he's always waiting
But I feel him hesitate

Oh I'm so worried about my love
They say no no it won't last forever

And here I am again my girl
Wondering what on earth am I doing here
Maybe he doesn't love me
I just took a trip on my love for him

Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
Ooh he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes

In his eyes...
