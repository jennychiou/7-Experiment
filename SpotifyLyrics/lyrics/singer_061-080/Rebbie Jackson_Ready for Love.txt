Now I'm into the mood
Baby, can't you tell the time is right
Now it's on you, boy
To try and get the fire started

I'm ready for love
I wanna be with you
I'm ready for love
Take me right now
I'm ready for love
I wanna be with you
I'm ready for love
Take me right now

I know it's okay, hey, hey
I wanna be loved this way
I know it's alright (it's alright)
I wanna be loved just right

I wanna be your charm, ow!
I wanna be there rocking in your arms
You might say that it's true
I'll change my life around just for you
I'm gonna take the chance
In you, I know there's true romance
It's the spark in your eyes
The way you look at me is so exciting

I'm ready for love
I wanna be with you
I'm ready for love
Take me right now
I'm ready for love
I wanna be with you (with you)
I'm ready for love
Take me right now

I know it's okay (it's okay)
I wanna be loved this way, hey, hey
I know it's alright
I wanna be loved just right

I'll tell you what I'll do
(Whatcha gonna do?)
I'll change my life around just for you
I'm gonna take the chance
In you, I know there's true romance

(I'm ready, I'm ready)
Don't you hear me now
(On your mark, get set, let's go!)
Hey!
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
I'm going for it!
(Slow down!)
Whoa-whoa-whoa

I'm ready for love
I wanna be with you
