Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

You need so much but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong
But you pretend you don't see

I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend
I'm just your little wife

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change but it won't
If you don't

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows

You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change but it won't
If you don't

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is truth when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change but it won't
If you don't

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is truth when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

She's had enough, she says the end
But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again
Till death do us part
