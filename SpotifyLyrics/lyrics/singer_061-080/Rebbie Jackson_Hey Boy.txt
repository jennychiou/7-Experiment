Hey, boy
You sure look awfully good
I wanna take you home with me
'Cause you're exactly what I see in my dreams
Is it really you?
(Is it really you?)

He makes me laugh
Sometimes makes me cry
Sunshine rising, so surprising
Not to see my guy laying by my side
Now don't you hide
(Don't try to hide)

Hey, boy
My heart's not made of toys
Don't play with my love like my dream
(Don't play with my love)
Hey, boy (hey, boy)
Don't you dare destroy this dream
I've been wanting to come true
Now it's been proved
That sometimes dreams come true
So I waited all my life just for you
(Just for you)

The joy you bring makes each moment seems
Like a fantasy and memory
I'm not laying holding my pillow tight
(Squeezing my pillow)
So my dreams are real
So real (so real)
Ooh, look into my eyes, don't ask me why
Wanna mesmerize you, take you in my arms
Ooh, and hold you tight (you tight)
Now don't be shy
Come on, boy, don't be shy

Hey, boy
You fill my heart with joy
My life no longer wants to dream
(I don't wanna dream no more)
Hey, boy
Let's go and explore each other
And take love for what it means
I'm in a sexy mood
(In a sexy mood)
I saved all my love just for you
(Just for you)

Hey, boy, hey, boy, hey, boy
All my dreams are for you

Hey, boy
My heart's not made of toys
Don't play with my love like my dream
(Don't play with my love)
Hey, boy (hey, boy)
Don't you dare destroy this dream
I've been holding on so long, yeah
Now it's been proved
Sometimes dreams come true
So I waited all my life just for you
(I don't wanna dream no more)

Hey, boy, ow!
Don't play with my love
Hey, hey, boy
