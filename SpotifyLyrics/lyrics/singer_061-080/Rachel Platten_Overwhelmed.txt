We make patterns out of stars
And we whisper little prayers
To be somewhere that we're not
And if we're good it will take us there

But then the light comes through the dark
And our questions fall apart
It's just the beating of our hearts and the still of the midnight air

And I get so overwhelmed till it's hard to tell
What I'm thinking

We get down down down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We get down down down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud loud loud till there's love and nothing else
'Cause the more that you give the more that comes back around

So we hide away our hurts
And put bandaids on our fears
And we lie to all our friends
Move along there's no problems here
But then the orchestra will start
And the violins appear
And a simple little melody has us fighting tears

And I get so overwhelmed till it's hard to tell
What I'm thinking

We get down down down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We get down down down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud loud loud till there's love and nothing else
'Cause the more that you give the more that comes back around

But the hardest part is the way things are
And how quickly fingers will bleed
And the grace we need is not in magazines,
It's just space, in between, when we breathe

I am down down down I feel sorry for myself
And I get down down down and I need somebody's help
Let's get loud loud loud till there's love and nothing else
'Cause the more that we give, the more that comes back

Down down down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We're down down down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud loud loud till there's love and nothing else
'Cause the more that you give the more that comes back around
