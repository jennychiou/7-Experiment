This thing called love I just can't handle it
This thing called love I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love 
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to Rock 'n' Roll
She drives my crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

I gotta be cool relax get hip!
Get on my track
Take a back seat
Hitch hike
And take a long long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

I gotta be cool relax get hip!
Get on my track
Take a back seat
Hitch hike
And take a long long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to Rock and Roll
She drives my crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

I gotta be cool relax get hip!
Get on my track
Take a back seat
Hitch hike
And take a long long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
