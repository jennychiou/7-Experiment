My love's a revolver
My love's a revolver

Oops I guess I shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it

Click click, I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal, baby
I'm no counterfeit, click, click

Line 'em up, knock 'em down
My looks can kill eo-eo
My body's fully loaded
And I got more ammo

Line 'em up, knock 'em down
My looks can kill eo-eo
You're an accessory
To a murder cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

I let it bang, bang

You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl, I got you cryin'
To your mama, sayin'

I can't believe it, I seen ya tight
Bring ya knife into a gun fight
Caught up in love right
Think I'm in love, I

Line 'em up, knock 'em down
My looks can kill eo-eo
My body's fully loaded
And I got more ammo

Line 'em up, knock 'em down
My looks can kill eo-eo
You're an accessory
To murder cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

I let it bang, bang

I shoot 'em bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?

I shoot 'em bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang
I line them up and watch them fall

Bang, the shooting name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain
She just screamed, shoot again

I gave her extra rounds
My barrel twist around
I am Mr., shoot 'em down
I leave hearts on the ground

My love using weapon
And yes, I use it well
Then I let the rose petals
Cover up the bullet shells

I never shoot to tell
I only shoot to kill
And the vest ain't gonna help it
Even if you're laying still

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

I let it bang bang

I shoot 'em bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang
I line them up and watch them fall

I shoot 'em bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang
I line them up and watch them fall

Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
