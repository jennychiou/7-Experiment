What did you think
I would do at this moment?
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes,
Trying to tell me that you
Have found you another
And you just don't love me no more.

What did you think
I would say at this moment?
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me.
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you?
'Cause you just don't love me no more.

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you?
Oh, come on, you know me too well
And how can I hurt you,
When darling I love you
And you know I would never hurt you

No, no, no!

What did you think
I would give at this moment?
If you'd just stay, I'd subtract
Twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees,
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on,
If I could just hold you again.

I'd fall down on my knees,
Kiss the ground that you walk on, baby,
If I could just hold you,
If I could just hold you,
I would fall down, down on my knees,
Oh, God, please...
Let me hold you, let me hold you again.

Woooooh, Woooooh.

I'm gonna miss you girl,
I'm gonna miss you girl.
I can see the tears in your eyes, baby
Babe, I know,
You know I'm down on my knees

What do you think I would do, baby?
Did you think I could hurt you?
