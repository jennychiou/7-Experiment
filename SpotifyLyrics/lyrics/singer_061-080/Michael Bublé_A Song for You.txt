I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I have made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly
But girl can't you see, there's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me, 'cause we're alone now
And I'm singing my song for you, you taught me precious secrets
The truth withholding nothing, you came out in front
When I was hiding, but now I'm so much better
So if my words don't come together, listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there is no space or time, I love you for my life
'Cause you are a friend of mine, and when my life is over
Remember, when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone, and I was singing my song for you
For you
