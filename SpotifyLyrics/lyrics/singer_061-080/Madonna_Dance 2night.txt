Hey Madonna, I'm taking you to the club. Go. Uh. Feels good. Uh, uh.

Move your body, catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watchin', but I just wanna give you more
Don't care 'bout nothin', I've fallen for your love in the worst way

So move closer, 'cause I can feel your body rise
The heat from you and I just had to fantasize
We're all alone now and I don't care what people have to say

You don't have to be beautiful to be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous to be good
You just gotta give more more more than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast fast fast if you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight and prove I'll save the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy, you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight, don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

Do it, do it, let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it till the break of dawn
Do it, do it, while the night is young
Let the music pull you through it till the lights go on

Now we're in our zone, do you wanna take it further
Cause before too long, I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony or do you wanna keep running this race

I'm so into you
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste

You don't have to be beautiful to be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous to be good
You just gotta give more more more than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast fast fast if you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight and prove I'll save the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy, you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight, don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

Do it, do it, let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it till the break of dawn
Do it, do it, while the night is young
Let the music pull you through it till the lights go on

Dance. Dance. Dance.
Do you wanna take it further?
Just dance.

Ca-ca-catch me on the floor, floor, floor
Ca-ca-catch me on the floor, floor, floor
