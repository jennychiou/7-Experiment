I can read on your face
You expect my disappointment
And you think that all you can be
Is never gonna be enough

And you feel you've fallen short
Well your doubts aren't silent
And it hurts me when my soul can hear
You underestimate me

Never think that you don't know
How to love me it isn't so

You don't need to be the perfect thing
You don't have to give me anything
Only all you can give from your heart
You don't need to be the perfect one
You're the closest I will ever come
Oh oh nobody's perfect, I know
And nobody's perfect at all
Until you fall in love with them

When you look at my face
I know you don't see what I see
But a better version of myself
Someone I wish I could be

When we make love like this
We are totally flawless
And I know we are at our best
We are so beautiful

Never think that you don't know
How to love me it isn't so

You don't need to be the perfect thing
You don't have to give me anything
Only all you can give from your heart
You don't need to be the perfect one
You're the closest I will ever come
Oh oh nobody's perfect, I know
And nobody's perfect at all
Until you fall in love with them
