It's a take-out weekend
It's a fake-out smile and pretend
If nobody sees you cry
You can say it was raining outside

And all that you want
Is a few days down
All that you need
A little time to drown
It's to be expected
With all the weight you carry 'round
All that you want is
A few days down


It's a short vacation
To a foreign nation
Oh, nothing familiar here
Just you and your lonesome heart complaining

And all that you want
Is a few days down
All that you need
A little time to drown
It's to be expected
With all the weight you carry 'round
All that you want is
A few days down

I'm looking out
Ten stories high
And like a blanket lifted
The quiet night
The city finally waking up
To the morning light

And all that you want
Is a few days down
All that you need
A little time to drown
It's to be expected
With all the weight you carry 'round
All that you want is
A few days down
