Osama - yo' mama didn't raise you right
When you were young she must have wrapped yo' turban too tight
She should have kept you home on those arabian nights
It's plain to see - you need to stay out of those fights

Osama - yo' mama could have done a lot better
Though I bet every day you did somethin' to upset her
By the way, we got an answer to your anthrax letter
New York City's where it's from - it's the news header

And I can hear yo' mama sayin' now, "You in a heap o' trouble son
Now just look what you've done!
Saw you on TV with yo' gun
Mercy sakes, I can't do a thing with you hon."

And I can just hear dubyah sayin', "You in a heap 'o trouble boy
And I don't think you will enjoy
Our game of search and destroy
We got your terror right here, son yu sure are the real mecoy.

Osama - yo' mama didn't teach you how to act
You've crossed the line too far this time, there ain't no turnin' back
You're startin' to remind us of another maniac
Yeah, you know what we shoud of stuffed you in an over sized sack!

Osama - yo' mama didn't teach you to behave
Now they say you're hangin' with the bats in a cave
Well, pullin' off that sneak attack was not too brave
Kinda makes us wonder if your digging your own grave?

And I can hear yo' mama sayin' again, "You in a heap o' trouble son
Now just look what you've done
Saw you on TV with yo' gun
Mercy sakes, you need to settle down hon!

And I can just hear dubyah sayin', "You in a heap 'o trouble boy
And I don't think you will enjoy
Our game of search and destroy
We have made a son that is a real mecoy!

Osama yo' karma's really got you in a jam
But that's just what you get - when you mess with Uncle Sam

Osama the Taliban is history
Nobody wants to see you startin' World War Three

Osama you know the al-Qaida won't last
Osama, just like you, it's future's in the past

Lets just pray your mama will be plastered!
Because oshama you sure are a basturd!
