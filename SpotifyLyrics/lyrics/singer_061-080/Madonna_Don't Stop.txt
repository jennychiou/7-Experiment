Get up on the dance floor, everything is groovin'
Get up on the dance floor, got to see you movin'
Let the music shake you, let the rhythm take you
Feel it in your body, sing la dee da dee

Don't stop doin' what you're doin' baby
Don't stop, keep movin', keep groovin'
Don't stop doin' what you're doin' baby
Don't stop, keep movin', keep groovin'

Come on join the party, let the bassline pump you
Bring your body over, baby let me bump you
I know I can groove you, you know I can move you
Feel it in your body, sing la dee da dee
