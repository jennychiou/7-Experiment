Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Now, give it to me

I'm so addicted to the lovin' that you're feedin' to me
Can't do without it, this feeling's got me weak in the knees
Body's in withdrawl, every time you take me away
Can't you hear me callin', beggin' you to come out and play?

So baby come to me
Show me who you are here
You’re sweet to me and so good to my heart, baby 
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy

Sweet, sweet loving, got me going to the extreme,
Won't go without it this vibe has gotta hold on me
Satisfying baby let me show what I'm made of
No doubt about it, got me feeling crazy can't get enough.

Won’t you come to me
Show me who you are here
You’re sweet to me and so good to my heart, baby
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy

So baby come to me
Show me who you are here 
You’re sweet to me and so good to my heart, baby
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy

(Now, give it to me
You know who you are,
Your love's as sweet candy,
I'll be forever yours, 
Love always, Mandy)

Boy, I'm cravin', 
Missin' you like candy

So baby come to me

You’re sweet to me and so good to my heart, baby
