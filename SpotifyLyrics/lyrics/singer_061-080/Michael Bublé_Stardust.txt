Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song.
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you.

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration.
Oh, but that was long ago,
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song.

And beside a garden wall,
When stars are bright,
You are in my arms.
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew.

Though I dream in vain,
In my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.

Though I dream in vain,
In my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.
