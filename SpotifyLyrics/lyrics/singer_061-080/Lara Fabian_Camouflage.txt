It isn't funny to see people fall
Where is the humor when they hit the wall
Clowns get ready for their scars and bruises
When they paint that smile on their face

We never see the real, real pain
It hides behind the masquerade
For fear the crowd's applause dies out
If they see a tear roll down

Why do we hide?
Camouflage
Why do we hide?

I wonder if I really am that brave
To take the risk and wipe it all away
Expose my heart in true and honest colors
Reveal the darker side I've never shown

We never see the real, real pain
It hides behind the masquerade
For fear the crowd's applause dies out
If they see a tear roll down

Why do we hide?
Camouflage
Why do we hide?
Camouflage
