Here we are now face to face
Gonna make it very clear
'Cause I don't have time to waste
If your heart is insincere
Tonight is gonna be the night
Tell ya how it's gonna be
Gonna give my love to you
If you give it back to me

That's the way I planned it
That's our destiny
It only takes a minute to come and go with me
Ain't no doubt about it
I'm so into you
Tell you just what I'm gonna do

Hit you with my love shot
Tell me can ya handle this or is it too hot?
Only gonna take one kiss to show what I've got
'Cause I won't stop
With my love shot

Oh yeah

I don't care what you did before
'Cause now it's a brand new game
I'm everything you're searchin' for
And you'll never be the same
Real love is what I'm all about
Don't ya know that I play full key?
So if you wanna treat me right... then you'll get the best for me

There's no way to fight it
There's no where to hide
No words to explain what I'm feeling deep inside
Take you on a journey
Sure to satisfy
Baby come along for the ride
