Here I go out to sea again
The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air

And I need a friend
Oh I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

Gulls in the sky
And in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

No need to run
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
