Now 
Tomorrow is all there is 
No need to look behind the door 
You won't be standing there no more 
I had my chance 
To dance another dance 
I didn't even realize 
That this was all love 
And no lies 
Then lost you 

While 
I guess I loved you 
Oh, less, less than I should 
Now all there is is me and me 
I turn around and all I see 
The past where I have left our destiny 

Now 
Tomorrow's a mystery 
I cannot live without a dream 
Vanishing from reality 
I wanna now 
Would you come back to me? 
Now that I finally realize 
You are my whole 
You are my life 
I need you 

I guess I loved you 
Oh, less, less than I should 
Now all there is is me and me 
I turn around and all I see 
The past where I have left our destiny 
Oh, oh, oh, I, I guess I loved you 
Oh, less, oh less, less, less than I could 
Another time 
Another run 
To mend both of our broken hearts 
To tell you how much I can love you now 
I, I guess, I guess I loved you 
I guess I loved you
