Here we are
On earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love
It's true
I've really found
Someone like you
Will it say
The love you feel for me
Will it say
That you will be by my side
To see me through
Until my life is through
Well, in my mind
We can conquer the world
In love you and I
You and I, you and I...
I am glad
At least in my life
I've found someone
That may not be here forever
To see me through
But I found my strength in you
Cause in my mind
You will stay here always
In love you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I
In my mind
We can conquer the world
In love you and I
You and I, you and I...
