I'm only happy when I'm with you
I only feel good when I'm talking to you
& I'm a mess when you don't call me
Call me at night
Where did you go
Where did you go
And did you think of me

It's hard to breathe
& my heart is sinking
I'm slipping fast
& I'm reaching for you
It's gonna hurt cause
I have been there before
Can't take much more
Can't take another night
Without you beside me

I want to review my kisses
On every inch of your body
I want to reveal my secrets
That only you should know
I feel all this pain inside of me
That only your lips can make better
I wanna review my kisses
So you won't forget that you are mine

Don't wanna care more than you do
Don't wanna be the 1 whos out in the rain
Don't wanna get that 
Call where you sound so cold
So far away, So far away
Like the distant roll of thunder

I want to review my kisses
On every inch of your body
I want to reveal my secrets
That only you should know
I feel all this pain inside of me
That only your lips can make better
I wanna review my kisses
So you won't forget that you are mine

It's a cave in the darkness
And I'm lost inside you 
Don't go

I want to review my kisses
On every inch of your body
I want to reveal my secrets
That only you should know
I feel like a childless mother
Longing to hold her baby
If I could review my kisses
Then you won't forget that you are mine
