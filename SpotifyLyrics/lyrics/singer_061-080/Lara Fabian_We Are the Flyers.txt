Never fly before you can
Make sure you know have to land
Or somebody's going to hurt
Gravity has the final word
And it's always gonna win

There's gonna come a time
You're gonna need a safe, safe place to fall
Oh, oh
Before you say goodbye
You better make sure you've said it all
Oh, oh

So come and hold me tight
Last chance let's dance on the wire
Don't worry cause tonight
Tonight we are the flyers

Never lie unless you can
Remember words come back again
Just like faders in the wind
They can rise and fall and spin
Sometimes they will lock you in

There's gonna come a time
You're gonna need a safe, safe place to fall
Oh, oh
Before you say goodbye
You better make sure you've said it all
Oh, oh

So come and hold me tight
Last chance let's dance on the wire
Don't worry cause tonight
Tonight we are the flyers (3x)
