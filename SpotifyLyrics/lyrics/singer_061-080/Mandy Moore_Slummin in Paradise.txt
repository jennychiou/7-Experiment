I'm a long way off
But I'm still around
Sitting on the couch
I'm watching you
And if I take my time
All the others give in
You still feel like you're standing in line

I just know that you're worth the wait
It's of no concern
It's a risk I'd gladly take
From time to time

Don't worry about yourself at all
I'll hang your work up on my wall
Hose you down and dress you up real nice

With some brand new plans and a fancy car
Try to place your superstar
'Cause you can tell the story of your life
Without slummin' in paradise

I wonder how you feel
Or do I?
Standing on the corner
How's your view?
From the other side
Mr. Right
It's not a pretty sight alone

Don't worry about yourself at all
I'll hang your work up on my wall
Hose you down and dress you up real nice

You won't often see this letter
Handed over right away
I know the first time I found you wonderful

Don't worry about yourself at all
I'll hang your work up on my wall
Hose you down and dress you up real nice
