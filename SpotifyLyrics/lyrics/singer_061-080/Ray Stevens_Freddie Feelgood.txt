Well they got a tight little unit you know they're the most
Famous all over from coast to coast
A-really layin' down the sound as much as you can stand (yeah, yeah)
They got 3 outfits a red yellow and blue
Volkswagon station wagon, luggage carrier too
Got their name painted on the side you know it looks so grand
I'm talkin' 'bout Freddie Feelgood and his Funky Little Five Piece Band
Whoa yeah

They got a drummer named Yum-Yum he can really go some
Blows real cool, makes all the girls drool (drum noises)
They got a cat named Ace, he blows the bass (bass noises)
They got another named Tyrone he plays trompone (trombone noises)
Cat named Percy, have mercy, plays piano in the treble cleff (piano)
And the trumpet man, he's the leader of the band
Yeah that's Freddie Feelgood hisself (obnoxious trumpet noises)
Ah, work out now!

("Band" plays)

Well they're packin' 'em in every place they go
Everybody starts to rockin' on the dancehall floor
Stompin' their feet to the rhythm and clappin' their hands (yeah, yeah)
Yeah you can bet everybody's gonna have a good time
'Cause the music they play you know it sounds so fine
It's the kind with a down-home beat that you can understand
I'm talkin' 'bout Freddie Feelgood and his Funky Little Five Piece Band
Whoa yeah
Ah, work out now!

("Band" plays again)
