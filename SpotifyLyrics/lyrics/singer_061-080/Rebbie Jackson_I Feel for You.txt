Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There was something 'bout the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

Baby, baby, hey, when I'm with you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

Whoa-whoa-whoa
Ow, play!

Hey, everybody, get with it!
C'mon, let's go!
1, 2, 3, 4, ow!

Whoo-whoo, I feel for you
I love you, I love you
Huh, huh, huh!
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it
Ooh! Hey!

Baby, I love you
Ow!
Hey, hey!

Baby, baby, hey, when I'm with you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me

I feel for you
I think I love you, I do, I do
I feel for you
I think I love you, ow!

I feel for you
I think I love you, I do, I do
I feel for you
I think I love you
