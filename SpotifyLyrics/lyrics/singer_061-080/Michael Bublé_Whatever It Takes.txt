We've all been hurt by love, it's out of our hands.
For all it's worth I'm drawing a line that's in the sand.
Another morning just won't do.
I need your love to shine on through
Or it won't be new.

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it,
Whatever it takes, my love.
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down,
Whatever it takes my love.

If there's a chance for two hearts to celebrate,
To blow out some candles and tempt the hands of fate,
You make a wish, I'll make one, too. (I'll make a wish)
But close your eyes, love, when you do
Or it won't be true.

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it.
Whatever it takes, my love,
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down,
Whatever it takes, my love.

Because I've been wandering around with the same old blues
That have been dragging me down if you feel the same way, too.
Maybe it just takes two.

And, if we give thanks for our love at each new dawn,
We'll find the strength and the will to carry on.
The sun alone will never do (Ooh)
Without your love to shine on through.
It just won't be new.

Whatever it takes,
Oh, whatever it takes, my love,
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down,
Whatever it takes, my love,
Oh, whatever it takes, my love,
Oh, to put the lonely days behind us, laying it down.

Whatever it takes, my love, my love, my love.
Whatever it takes,
Whatever it takes, my love,
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down,
Whatever it takes, my love. (Whatever it takes, my love.)
