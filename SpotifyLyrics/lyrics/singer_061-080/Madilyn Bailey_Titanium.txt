You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium

Cut me down, but it's you who had further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love, Raise your voice
Sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium

Stone-hard, machine guns, firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard, those bulletproof glass

You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium

You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down
But I won't fall, I am titanium, I am titanium
