Like the sun, like the light, like the flame
Like the storm I burn through everything
Like a bomb in the night, like a train
Thundering through the hills, let it rain

Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I’m a sinner, I like it that way
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I’m a sinner, I like it that way

All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Ride the [[The Who:Magic Bus|magic bus]] tonight

I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner, I like it that way
I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner, I like it that way

Like a moon with no light of my own
Surfs the sky for a place to call home
I woke up with my head in the fire
Get my kicks when I’m walking the wire

Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I’m a sinner, I like it that way
Ah, ooo-woo-ooo-hooo
Ah, woo-oo-hoo-hoo
I’m a sinner, I like it that way

All the boys, all the boys and girls
Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Ride the magic bus tonight

I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner, I like it that way
I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner, I like it that way

I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner, I like it that way
I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
Praise the lord and I like it that way

Hail Mary, full of grace
Get down on your knees and pray
Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross
Died for our sins, it’s such a loss

Saint Christopher, find my way
I’ll be coming home one day
Saint Sebastian, don’t you cry
Let those poison arrows fly

Saint Anthony, lost and found
Thomas Aquinas, stand your ground
All those saints and holy men
Catch me before I sin again

Oooh-ooo-woo-hoo
Oooh-ooo-woo-hoo
I’m a sinner, I like it that way
Oooh-ooo-woo-hoo
Oooh-ooo-woo-hoo
I’m a sinner, I like it that way

I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner, I like it that way
I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner, I like it that way

You’re a sinner, you’re a sinner
You’re a sinner, you like it that way
We’re all sinners, we’re all sinners
We’re all sinners

I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner
I’m a sinner
And I like it that way

Hail Mary, full of grace
