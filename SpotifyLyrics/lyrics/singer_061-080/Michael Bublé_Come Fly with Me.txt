Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In lama land, there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there,
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear the angels cheer 
Because we're together

Weatherwise it's such a lovely day 
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say
S'Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away

Once I get you up there,
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear all the angels cheer 
Because we're together

Weatherwise it's such a lovely day
You just say those words, and we'll beat those birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's so perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say
Come fly with me
Let's fly let's fly
Pack up let's fly away
