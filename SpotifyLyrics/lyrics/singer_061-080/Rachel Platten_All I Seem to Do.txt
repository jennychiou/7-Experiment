Each time you leave
I can't know when
You will slip in
And lean against my door
And I will try to hide my eyes,
Seal my voice,
Try to deny,
How long I have
Waited here for you

Now I'm broken, hoping
That you'll glue me up again

All I seem to do
Hold my breath,
Waiting here for you
And all I seem to want
Is the warmth
Of your hands on me
I can't bear to think
Of you leaving me again
And all I seem to want
Is the warmth of your skin

I wait to hear
Your car switch gears
Last night's glasses
Steam like cheap red wine
Your warm face
A thought misplaced
I sink into assorted grace
I pull up my shades
And finally sleep

Now I'm broken, hoping
That you'll glue me up again

Oh, I will eat up
Every word you say (oh)
And if you love me
Let me stay (ooh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-oh oh)

And all I seem to do
Hold my breath
Waiting here for you
And all I seem to want
Is the warmth
Of your fingers too
I can't bear to think
Of you leaving me again

And all I seem to want
Is the warmth of your skin [X2]
