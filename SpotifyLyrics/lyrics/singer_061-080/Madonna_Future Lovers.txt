"spoken:"
I'm gonna tell you... about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills, and loans
Come with me

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

"spoken:"
In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide love inside their eyes

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

Not controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free

Put away your past
Love will never last
If you're holding on to a dream that's gone

"spoken:"
I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

There's no love... like the future love

Come with me

Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Ooh, It's so good, It's so good, It's so good, It's so good, It's so good
Ooh, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I'm feel love

I feel love, I feel love

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

Not controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free

I feel love, I feel love
