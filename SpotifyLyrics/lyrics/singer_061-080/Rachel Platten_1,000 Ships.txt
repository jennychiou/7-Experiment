I'd go beyond our fighting borders
If you needed that from me
And I'd march with decorated soldiers
To get your pretty eyes to see
Well I would bring your morning coffee
Then I'd wrap you up in me
I'd kiss your belly and your shoulders,
Cover blankets on our feet
So slow down there's some kind of blessing here
But you have missed your cue

So keep your eyes set on the horizon,
On the line where blue meets blue
And I bet that silver lining,
Well I know it'd find you soon
'Cause I have sailed a 1000 ships to you,
But my messages don't seem to make it through

Well I would bring your morning coffee
Then I'd wrap you up in me (me)
Deedeedee
I'd kiss your belly and your shoulders,
Cover blankets on our feet
But slow down there's some sort of blessing here
But you've gone and missed your cue

So keep your eyes set on the horizon,
On the line where blue meets blue
And I bet that silver lining,
Well I know it'll find you soon
'Cause I have sailed a 1000 ships to you,
But my messages don't seem to make it through

Well money and fame they are a losing game
And I know those pretty actresses are calling your name,
But I'll be here waiting, I'll always be the same
If you'd let me in again

Hahahahahaha

Hahahahahaha 3x

So keep your eyes set on the horizon,
On the line where blue meets blue
And I bet that silver lining,
Well I know it'll find you soon
