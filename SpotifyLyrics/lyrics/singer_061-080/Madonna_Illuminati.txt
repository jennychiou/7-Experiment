It's not Jay-Z and Beyoncé
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama, the Pope and Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye

It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga, Gucci or Prada
Riding on the Golden calf

The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That’s what it is: truth and the light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets in sight

It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah, woah, woah)"
It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah, woah, woah)"

It's the enlightenment that started it all
The Founding Fathers wrote it down on a wall
And now the media's misleading us all
To right or to wrong

It's time to dance and turn this dark into somethin'
So let the fire burn, this music is bumpin'
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It’s not platinum-encrypted commerce
It's not Isis or the Phoenix, pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid

It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not the Google of United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron, Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you love to hate

The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That’s what it is: truth and the light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets in sight

It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah, woah, woah)"
It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah, woah, woah)"

You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
Come on, let's go

We're gonna dance and turn the dark into somethin'
So let the fire burn, this music is bumpin'
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

It's like
It's like

It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah, woah, woah)"
It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah)"

It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah, woah, woah)"
It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati "(oh woah, woah, woah)"

It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati

Everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party
Shining like Illuminati
