All good things...
All good things...
All good things...

Not sure where to go
Everybody I know
Says I'm too forgiving
And now that I'm gone
I don't wanna move on
I just keep reliving

All good things
I wish you
All good things
Come to an end
All good things
I wish you well

Lost inside of my head
Empty side of the bed
I feel this place without you
I keep pushing this bruise
'Cause I know I don't wanna lose
What I loved about you

All good things
I wish you
All good things
Come to an end
All good things
I wish you well

I can think of a million ways
You proved you weren't the one
So live inside of your shades of gray
And never mind the sunshine
That I'll find...

I got so much space now
I've got a whole house
With the wind blowing through
I don't need somewhere to hide
I've got this whole world inside
I was accustomed to showing you

All good things
I wish you
All good things
Come to an end
All good things
I wish you well

Oh

All good things...
Oh oh
All good things
Oh oh, oh oh
All good things...
Oh I wish you well...
