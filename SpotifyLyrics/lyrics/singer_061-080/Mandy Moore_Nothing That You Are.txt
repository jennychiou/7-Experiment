Somebody told me
They saw you somewhere
Somebody hold me
'Cause suddenly I'm a little cold
Well I must be mistaken
It was somebody else
I know you all too well
Or do I?

I heard you say
We were one and the same
Well, wrong again
I could never do those things you did to me
I will be okay
In time you'll fade
Into the nothing that you are
The nothing you are

Somebody sold me
The same old story
Hadn't you told me
You were there the whole time
Well I must be mistaken
You were somebody else
I hope you burn in hell 
Or do I?

I heard you say
We were one and the same
Well, wrong again
I could never do those things you did to me
I will be okay
In time you'll fade
Into the nothing that you are
The nothing you are

And your mistakes will hunt you down
Eventually
You know that when you hit the ground
Your weakness did you in
And dealt me out
It's ok, I have the truth on my side

I heard you say
We were one and the same
Well, wrong again
I could never do those things you did to me
I will be okay
In time you'll fade
Into the nothing that you are
The nothing you are
