Needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
Needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Touching my emotion

I want to stop, and thank you baby
I just want to stop - and thank you baby... woawoa yeah
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wonderin' where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was such a bore
Everywhere I went
You know I've been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so may ways

I want to stop, and thank you baby
I just want to stop - and thank you baby... woawoa
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me there is you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop, and thank you baby
I just want to stop - and thank you baby... woawoaaaa
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I mean it's like cowabulla don't you know to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by yooooou
