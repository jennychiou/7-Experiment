There's so much I don't know about you and I'm dying to
It's like there is an obstacle that's keeping me from you
We were at the beach and you were hiding on your phone
You said nothing's wrong, but something's wrong
You know my insecurities, I always air 'em out
But I think showing weakness is, is something to be proud
God, it'd be so beautiful to see that side of you
All the messy parts, every part
Your whole, whole heart

(Hey) So come on, baby, open up
I swear you won't be sorry
(Hey) Yeah, you know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry
Hoo na na na, hoo na na na
I want your whole, whole heart
Give me that hoo na na na, hoo na na na
I want your whole, whole heart, lay it on me

There's something in your head that you can't seem to get around
Ghosts of past relationships that only let you down
Tell me all your darkest secrets, baby, try me out
I'll walk you through, just me and you
(And me and you)

You doubt I could be your safety net
What now? Why don't you just love me?
And why doubt all of my intentions?
You got my attention, my whole, whole heart

(Hey) So come on, baby, open up
I swear you won't be sorry
(Hey) Yeah, you know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry
Hoo na na na, hoo na na na
I want your whole, whole heart
Give me that hoo na na na, hoo na na na
I want your whole, whole heart, lay it on me

You doubt I could be your safety net
What now? Why don't you just love me?
And why doubt all of my intentions?
You got my attention, my whole, whole heart

So come on, baby, open up
You know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry

(Hey) So come on, baby, open up
I swear you won't be sorry
(Hey) Yeah, you know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry
Hoo na na na, hoo na na na
I want your whole, whole heart
Give me that hoo na na na, hoo na na na
I want your whole, whole heart, lay it on me

Whole, whole heart
I want your whole, whole heart
Lay it on me
