Walk me home, I don't wanna go all the way alone
Baby would you walk with me home
Baby would you take my hand
Come with me now to a special land
Baby would you walk with me home

3 A.M., you're on my mind once again
I must have been dreamin'
Thought I felt your heartbeat just then
And I wondered how it would be
If I was your lady and you were my friend
I would put my heart in your hands
And it would never end

Baby would you walk me home? (walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (all alone)
Baby would you walk with me home?
Baby would you take my hand? (take my hand)
Come with me now to a special land (oh)
Baby would you walk with me home?

Oh ohoh
Oh ohoh
La la la la la la

I hold your picture
Next to my heart all the time
Oh yeah baby

You're my dream come true
So glad you're mine
And I wonder how it would be
If I was your lady and you were my friend
I would put my heart in your hands
And it would never end

Baby would you walk me home? (walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (all alone)
Baby would you walk with me home?
Baby would you take my hand? (take my hand)
Come with me now to a special land (oh)
Baby would you walk with me home?

Everyday and night I wanna hold you (hold you)
Understand I am going to love you
In my own special way (in my own special way)

Baby would you walk me home? (walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (all alone)
Baby would you walk with me home?
Baby would you take my hand? (take my hand)
Come with me now to a special land (oh)
Baby would you walk with me home?

Baby would you walk me home? (walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (all alone)
Baby would you walk with me home?
Baby would you take my hand? (take my hand)
Come with me now to a special land (oh)
Baby would you walk with me home?

Oh
Won't you walk with me home?
