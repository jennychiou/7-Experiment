Baby, I get a little bit jealous
But how the hell can I help it?
When I'm thinkin' on you
Maybe, I might get a little reckless
But you gotta expect that
What else can a boy do?
My momma taught me how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care
'Cause I want you, I need you all for me

Now I don't want anybody loving my baby
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me, hey
Now I don't want anybody thinking just maybe
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me

And I know when you got a lovely lady
It might drive the boys crazy
When she's looking so fine, whoa
I know, know, know that no one would ever blame me
The only thing that could save me
Is just knowing you're mine
My papa told me once or twice
Don't be cruel but don't be too nice
'Cause I want you, I need you all for me

'Cause I don't want anybody loving my baby
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me, hey
And I don't want anybody thinking just maybe
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me

Hey, we make beautiful music together, how you make my heart sing
Move into the side with us and never be apart thing
Work of art thing, the way you pull me like a harp string
Every moment spent is worth it, that's the perfect part, see
I like whatever you like, we had to do right
And do like, two sovereign nations and try to unite
I'm proud of you, like a treasure, you're the one I'm cherishing
Every other girl is silly, paling in comparison

Baby, I get a little bit jealous
But how the hell can I help it?
I'm so in love with you

I don't want anybody loving my baby
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me, hey
I don't want anybody loving my baby
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me

Oh my papa told me once or twice
Don't be cruel, don't be too nice
My baby don't need no one but me
Oh, and I know how to share
But I'll be selfish, I don't care
My baby don't need no one but me
