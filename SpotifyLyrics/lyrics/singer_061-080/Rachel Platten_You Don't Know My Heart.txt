Hey, my fists are tight and I'm afraid
'Cause I cannot, I cannot explain
Your heart is like a hurricane
But can't you see I'm so in pain

Guess I'm not ,cause I don't talk
And then you write me off again
And I don't think you understand at all

I don't wanna use my mouth
Don't know how to spell it out
Every time I try, it sucks
I just wish you could open me up

And see all the confusion
And the love, the hurt, the wrong words I'm using
'Cause tonight, it feels like

Like you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
You don't know, you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh

Why, you say I never really see
That it's only ever 'bout me?
Like I don't listen when you speak
Like it doesn't kill me

When your tears fall down and I cannot catch 'em
And I do not have the perfect expression
And I don't think you understand at all

I don't wanna use my mouth
Don't know how to spell it out
Every time I try, it sucks
I just wish you could open me up

And see all the confusion
And the love, the hurt, the wrong words I'm using
'Cause tonight, it feels like

Like you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
You don't know, you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh

Like you don't know my "(feels like)"
Like you don't know my "(feels like)"
You don't know, you don't know my heart "(feels like eh)"
You don't know, you don't know my heart  "(feels like eh, eh, eh, eh)"

I don't wanna use my mouth
Don't know how to spell it out
Every time I try, it sucks
I just wish you could open me up

And see all the confusion
And the love, the hurt, the wrong words I'm using
'Cause tonight, it feels like

Like you don't know my "(feels like)"
You don't know, you don't know my heart "(feels like eh)"
You don't know, you don't know my heart "(feels like eh)"
You don't know, you don't know my heart "(feels like eh)"

Like you don't know my "(feels like)"
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart "(feels like eh)"
You don't know, you don't know my heart "(feels like)"
You don't know, you don't know my heart "(feels like eh)"
