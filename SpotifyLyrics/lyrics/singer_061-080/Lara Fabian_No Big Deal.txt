Looking from a distance, seems like I've lost it all
And everyone around me is waiting for this girl to fall
But my heart is missing, I just lost control
If I don't know why, why would I know how?

I've been working with the devils, trying to exorcise
The feelings I've been hiding down on a darker side
But full completed treading I never sold my soul 
I'm simply moving on, going, gone

And I'm losing the fight to make sense of it all
Got to build on my lie so I'm saved from the fall
I'm subjected, expected to know what I feel
But I don't feel nothing, it's alright, no big deal

How can I expect anybody to understand?
I've been silent treating all on my own demands
Now all I need is freedom on this ego-land
What I do is gone
I'm simply moving on, I'm going, going, gone

I think I'm losing the fight to make sense of it all
Got to build on my lie so I'm saved from the fall
I'm subjected, expected to know what I feel
But I don't feel nothing, it's alright, no big deal

And after all I know, there's nothing left to say
And I will fall my falls, I'll take it all
I'm moving on, going, gone

And I'm losing the fight to make sense of it all
Got to build on my lie so I'm saved from the fall
I'm subjected, expected to know what I feel
But I don't feel nothing, it's alright, no big deal
