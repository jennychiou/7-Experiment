He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately, I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again
Beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me
I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart but what of it
He is cold, I agree
He can laugh but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him
Each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well, I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot
I'm mean a lot
But now I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am
