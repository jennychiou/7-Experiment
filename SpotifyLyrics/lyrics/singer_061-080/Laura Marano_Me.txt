I think how good you would look on my body (mhm)
I daydream about all the shit you tell me (yeah)
Unzip all the logic like no one's watching (mhm)
And do all of the things that I've been wanting (yeah)

I gotta know
Does it mean, does it mean anything
Does it show
Every minute you're all that I think
About so
Do you think, do you think, do you think

About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me

Last night when you touched me, you lit a fire (mhm)
I know that you felt it, don't be a liar (yeah)
Break down the walls, and we'll fall into all the desire
Tell me the things you want, and I'll be your supplier

I gotta know
Does it mean, does it mean anything
Does it show
Every minute you're all that I think
About so
Do you think, do you think, do you think

About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me

La, la, la, la, do you think about me
La, la, la, la, do you think about me
All that I want is for you to want me
La, la, la, la, do you think about me (I gotta know)
La, la, la, la, do you think about me (does it mean, does it mean anything)
La, la, la, la, do you think about me (does it show)
All that I want is for you to want me (every minute you're all that I think)
La, la, la, la, do you think about me (about so)
Do you think, do you think, do you think

About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me ('cause I think about you)
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me (I think about you)
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me (do you think, do you think, do you think)
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me (do you think, do you think, do you think)
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
About me, me, me, me, me, me, me
