Just one kiss, on my lips
Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look, from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture
Once upon a time
There was a boy, and there was a girl
Just one touch, from your hands
Was all it took to make me falter

Forbidden love
Are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love
We seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

Just one smile, on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word, from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain
Once upon a time
There was a boy, and there was a girl
Hearts that intertwined
We lived in a different kind of world

Forbidden love
Are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love
We seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

Just one kiss
Just one touch
Just one look

Forbidden love
Are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love
We seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

Forbidden love
Are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love
We seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

Just one kiss (Five)
Just one touch (Four)
Just one look (Three)
Just one love, (Two)
One
