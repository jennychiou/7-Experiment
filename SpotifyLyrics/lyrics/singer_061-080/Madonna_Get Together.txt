It's... all an illusion...
There's... too much confusion... fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion

Down, down, down in your heart
Find, find, find the secret
Turn, turn, turn your head around
Baby, we can do it
We can do it all right

Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion
I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion
Come on over here

Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

I searched, I searched, I searched my whole life
To find, find, find the secret
But all I did was open up my eyes
Baby, we can do it
We can do it all right

Do you believe that we can change the future?
Do you believe I can make you feel better?

Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

It's... all an illusion...
There's... too much confusion...
I'll... make you feel better...
If it's bitter at the start
Then it's sweeter in the end

Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion
I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion
Come on over here

Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

Get together
It's... all an illusion...
There's... too much confusion...
I'll... make you feel better...
If it's bitter at the start
Then it's sweeter in the end
