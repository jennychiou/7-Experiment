Looking for a little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel

Look up
Do the lines on your face cut a little bit deeper
I know you're not feeling very young
So tired
Stuck in the place and you don't wanna be here
I know
Voices call you in the night
Come away! Come away!

Just looking for a little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel
A little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel

Hey now
From the wells of your eyes comes a deep frustration
Sometimes it can seem so hard to try
Everyday is a need for money you bleed
You're lonely when there's someone beside you
I know
That in these arms you'll find
All of this will pass

Just looking for a little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel
A little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel

'Cause everybody needs a harbor in the tempest
A reason to believe you're more than what you have
Even more than what you had
'Cause all of this will pass

Looking for a little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel
A little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel
A little light to illuminate
The truth in the stillness after everything is blown away
Life fades in the cuts and the struggles
I just need a light at the end of the tunnel
