What are you waiting for, nobody's gonna show you how
Why wait for someone else to do what you can do right now

Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on and on and on

Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

They say that a good thing never lasts and then it has to fall
Those are the people that did not amount to much at all

Give me then bass line and I'll shake it
Give me a record and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go and I'll take it

Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on and on and on

Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

Watch this

You're only here to win, get what they say?
You're only here to win, get what they do?
They'd do it too if they were you
You done it all before, this ain't nothing new

You're only here to win, get what they say?
