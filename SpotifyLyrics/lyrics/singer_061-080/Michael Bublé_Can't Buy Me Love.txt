Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend, if it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend, if it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too
Much for money
Money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give, if you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give, but what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too
Much for money
Money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no no no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings, and I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things, that money just can't buy
I don't care too
Much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no no no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings, and I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things, that money just can't buy
I don't care too
Much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
