I'm making this one special evening
Taking a chance in my life
Hoping you feel the same way as I do tonight
Just try and look into my eyes
Don't be scared of what you might see there
The first time I saw you
I knew love at first sight must be true, so true, oh so true
And now I just have to explain why I feel this way
I feel joy, I feel pain
You're in my heart and it's tearing me apart
'Cause I love you, I love you, I love you!
