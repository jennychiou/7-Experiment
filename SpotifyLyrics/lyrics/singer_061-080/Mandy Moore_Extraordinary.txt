I was a daydream
Quiet and unseen
I lived in stories
But inside I kept a mystery
I was a starling
Nobody's darling
Flying in perfect circles 
Just for company

And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready to be
Extraordinary

A midnight airplane
A window glowing
I know I am another
Sparkle in the sky
I shine uncovered
Still undiscovered
But you might see me in the corner of your eye

And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready to be
Extraordinary

Waking up to a week of Sundays
I've got my own parade
Stopping off at a sidewalk cafe
Wind is playing in the trees 
Kicking up confetti leaves
Seems as if it's all to say

And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready to be
Extraordinary
