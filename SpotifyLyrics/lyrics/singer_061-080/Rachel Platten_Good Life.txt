I'm stumbling over my laces
Kaleidoscope of everyone's faces
All my friends are saying, "Come on, Rachel, you should sit"
But, God, this music feels so good, I do the opposite
How 'bout we stay and never go home
And be in the present and break all our phones?
I just wanna stay this high on stream of consciousness
No, I don't wanna overthink it or I'll ruin it

Don't gotta be afraid of those ghosts
Angels on my shoulder, and I know
If I stay in the moment and be right here, right now
'Cause I know

I'm living when I feel like that
I'm living when I open my eyes
And, ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, I suddenly realize
I'm living when my heart reacts
I see the colors in the sunrise
And, ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I got a good life

And every stranger in their car
Has a private concert right where they are
I just wanna kiss the whole world and hug all the planets
It's like I'm onto something big when I don't overplan it

Don't gotta be afraid of old ghosts
Devil's on my shoulder, has gone home
If I stay in the moment and be right here, right now
'Cause I know

I'm living when I feel like that
I'm living when I open my eyes
And, ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, I suddenly realize
I'm living when my heart reacts
I see the colors in the sunrise
And, ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I got a good life

And there's so much love (Do you feel it?)
So much love ('Cause I feel it)
There's so much love, yeah
I'm living when I finally realize I got a good life

"spoken:"
I'm really like, the luckiest person in the world in the smallest ways
'Cause I get to make music, I get to make music
Every day, no matter who's listening, no matter what it sounds like
No matter if no one hears the baby I made that day
I get to move molecules around in space, that's crazy
And even when it's scary and terrifying
And my inner child in the sandlot gets her sand castle kicked over
I'm still building, I'm still learning
'Cause I'm growing, I'm breathing, and I'm living

Don't gotta be afraid of old ghosts
Devil's on my shoulder, has gone home
If I stay in the moment and be right here, right now
'Cause I know

I'm living when I feel like that
I'm living when I open my eyes
And ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, I suddenly realize
I'm living when my heart reacts
I see the colors in the sunrise
And, ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I got a good life

And there's so much love (Do you feel it?)
So much love ('Cause I feel it)
There's so much love
I'm living when I finally realize I got a good life
And there's so much love (Do you feel it?)
There's just so much love ('Cause I feel it)
There's just so much, so much love
I'm living when I finally realize I got a good life
