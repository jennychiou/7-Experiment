(With Michael Jackson)

Our love's in motion
Give me a notion 'cause
You know we'll never part
Our love goodbye

I love in season
Give me a reason 'cause
You know we'll never part
Our love goodbye

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it...

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today...

I love a notion
Give me a motion 'cause
You know we'll never see
The thing you see

I love a reason
Give me a treason 'cause
You know we'll never part
I love so hard

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
(I'll give you my heart)
No place too far for us
We don't need it...

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today...

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today...

Love is here to stay...

(Rebbie, spoken)
You know baby
I don't wanna go away
I don't wanna fly away
Oh no...

Alone at last
I give you my heart
(I give you my heart)
No place too far for us
We don't need it...

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today...

(Michael, sample)
Love you
Love you
Love you girl...
Make me fly away...
