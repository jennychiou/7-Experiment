Hola! Ese pato loco!

I'm going bananas,
And I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas,
For I'm going bananas.

I'm non compos mentis,
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist,
For I'm non compos mentis.

Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat,
That makes me gonzo.
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas,
Someone book me a room in the hot hacienda with all my mananas
For I'm going bananas.

I'm going meshugga
All day long there's a man in my brain incessantly playing "Booga Wooga",
But I'm going meshugga.

There's bats in my belfry.
Won't you make sure this straitjacket's tight,
Otherwise I might get myself free.
Yes, there's bats in my belfry.

Who knows?
Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think,
That makes me gonzo.
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas,
Someone get me a bed in the "Casa de Loco" for all my mananas,
For I'm going bananas.
Yes, I'm going bananas.
Si, I'm going bananas.
