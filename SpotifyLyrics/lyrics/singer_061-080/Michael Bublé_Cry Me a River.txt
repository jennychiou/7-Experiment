Now, you say you're lonely, 
You cried the whole night through.
Well, you can cry me a river, 
Cry me a river.
I cried a river over you.

And, now, you say you're sorry 
For being so untrue.
Well, you can cry me a river, 
Cry me a river.
I cried a river over you.

You drove me, 
Nearly out of my head. 
While you never shed a tear, babe.  

Remember? 
I remember all that you said.
You told me love was too plebeian, 
Told me you were through with me. 

And, now, you say you love me. 
Well, just to prove that you do, 
Why don't you cry me a river,
Cry me a river. 
'Cause I cried a river over you.

You say you love me, but you lie!

Now, you say you love me. 
Well, just to prove that you do... 

Come on and cry me a river, 
Oh, cry me a river. 
I cried a river over you, 
I cried a river over you.

I cried a river, 
Now, you can, too. 
Cry me a river. 
Cry me a river.
