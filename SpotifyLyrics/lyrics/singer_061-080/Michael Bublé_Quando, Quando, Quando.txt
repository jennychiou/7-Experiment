Tell me, when will you be mine
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
We can share a love divine
Please don't make me wait again

When will you say yes to me?
(When will you say, yes to me?)
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
(Tell me, quando, quando, quando)
You mean happiness to me
(You mean happiness to me)
Oh, my love please tell me when

Every moment's a day
(Every moment's a day)
Every day seems a lifetime
(Every day, it seems like a lifetime)
Let me show you the way
(Let me show you the way)
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
(Tell me, quando, quando, quando)
Just say, it's me that you adore
And then darling, tell me when

Now, every moment's a day
(Every moment's a day)
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way
(Let me show you the way)
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
(I can't wait a moment more)
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
Say, it's me that you adore
And then darling tell me when

Oh, my darling tell me when
And then darling tell me when
Oh, my darling tell me when
Ooh
