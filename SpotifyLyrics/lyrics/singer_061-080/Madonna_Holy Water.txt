I can give you everything that you want
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole
You can't buy this at no luxury store
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole

There's a place you gotta go before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby you should get down low and drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

"(Kiss it better, kiss it better)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Make it better, make it wetter)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Kiss it better, make it wetter)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Kiss it better, kiss it better)"

I can teach you all the things you don't know 
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole
It's rare like mink it's something you wanna own
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole

There's something you gotta hear, it's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven's door
I promise you it's not a sin, find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

"(Kiss it better, kiss it better)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Make it better, make it wetter)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Kiss it better, make it wetter)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Kiss it better, kiss it better)"

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(bless yourself and genuflect)"
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(if you like it, please confess)"

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(bless yourself and genuflect)"
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(Yeezus loves my pussy best)"

Holy water, holy water, holy water,...

Ladies with an attitude
Don't just stand there, don't, don't, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it

There's something you gotta hear
It's sacred and immaculate

I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within

"(Kiss it better, kiss it better)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Make it better, make it wetter)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Kiss it better, make it wetter)" Don't it taste like holy water
"(Kiss it better, kiss it better)"

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(bless yourself and genuflect)"
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(Yeezus loves my pussy best)"

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(bless yourself and genuflect)"
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water "(Yeezus loves my pussy best)"
