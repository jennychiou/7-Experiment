Look-a there, there he goes
Ha, there goes the funny man
The life of the party, that's me

And they'd never guess
That I had a care
They'd be amazed to see me cry
When the party's through
Cry over you

Talk loud, funny man
In the crowd, funny man
You're in rare form today

Leave em' laughing as you walk away, yeah, yeah
But they wouldn't laugh
If they only knew that I'll go home alone
To cry, cry the whole night through
Cry over you

And who's to know that this clever clown
Is really the fool of a town?
Yes, who's to know the girl I loved
Laughed when she turned me down?

So, tell a joke, funny man
Be gay, funny man
Don't give yourself away, funny man
Pretend you didn't love her anyway

Act as though nothin's wrong
Wear good smile to go alone
Then cry, cry the whole night through
'Cause there's nothin' you can do
