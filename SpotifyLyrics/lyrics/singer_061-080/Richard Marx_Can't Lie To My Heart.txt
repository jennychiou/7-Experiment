I whispered you
Words I thought I'd never say.
We played the game,
But then we tossed the rules away.
Could deny it
Justify it,
But we both know that we went too far.
Oh, I can feel you,
And I need you,
No matter wherever you are.

I don't want to watch my love come crashing down,
But I can't lie to my heart.
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round.
But baby, I just can't lie to my heart.

I have loved you
Longer than you've even known.
When you hurt, I hurt.
I'm your flesh, and you're my bone.
If I could only
Be two people,
Darlin', I swear we'd both be with you.
Oh, I know I'm selfish,
But I'm helpless.
I want you, and nothing else will do!

I don't want to watch my love come crashing down,
But I can't lie to my heart.
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round,
Rippin' me right apart.

I won't pretend anymore.
Been hiding too long.
I won't go on like before.
I'm not that strong!

{Guitar Interlude}

Oh, I can feel it when I'm near you.
It's not healthy to need you this way.
Try to fight it, get inside it,
But this pain is stronger than me, and it won't go away!

I don't want to watch my love come crashing down,
But I can't lie to my heart.
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round,
Rippin' me right apart.

I don't want to watch my love come crashing down,
But I can't lie to my heart.
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round.
Not anymore!
I can't lie anymore!
Baby, I can't. Baby, I can't.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoa, whoa. Whoa.
No, baby, I just can't lie to my heart.
