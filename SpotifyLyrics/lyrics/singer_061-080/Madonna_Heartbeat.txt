On any given night, catch me on the floor
Working up a sweat, that's what music's for
I'd rather not explain, for me it's just usual

(You can catch me poppin' that) Once I get going
(Droppin' that) I am gone...
(Ain't no stoppin' that)
(Are you watching that?)
(You can catch me poppin' that) I'll keep it going
(Droppin' that) All night long...
(Ain't no stoppin' that)
(Are you watching that?)

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see, when I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (the only one)
That the light shines on
"Hey!"

This complicated life, I try to do my best
I always tell myself, it's all just a test
For me it's an escape, cause dancing makes me beautiful
"Come on"

(And I can't pretend) Once I am moving
(It should never end) I'm all right
(Let the music play)
"She's all right" (Are you watching now?)
"All right, all right" (You can catch me poppin' that)
I'll keep on dancing (it should never end)
Through the night (Let the music play)
('Cause I'm here to stay)

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see, when I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (the only one)
That the light shines on
"Hey!"

See my booty get down like (uh)
See my booty get down like (c'mon, uh)
See my booty get down like (lower, uh)
See my booty get down like (little lower baby, uh)

Get down
Uh uh, get down (c'mon, uh)
See my booty get down like

You probably think I'm crazy, I don't want you to save me (dance)
Don't mean to disappoint you, I've never felt so free
If you could stand in my shoes, then you would feel my heartbeat too

(You can catch me poppin' that) Once I am moving
(Droppin' that) I'm all right...
(Ain't no stoppin' that) "She's all right"
(Are you watching that?) "All right, all right..."
(You can catch me poppin' that) I can keep on going
(Droppin' that) Through the night...
(Ain't no stoppin' that)
(Are you watching that?)

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see, when I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see, when I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (the only one)
That the light shines on
"Girl!"

M-dolla, M-dolla, what
