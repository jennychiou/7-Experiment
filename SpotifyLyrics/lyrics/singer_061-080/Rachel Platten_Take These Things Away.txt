I want someone to know my favorite ice cream
I want someone to laugh when I act like I'm thirteen
I need someone to stay till I can fall asleep
Make being awake like living in a dream

And at the end of everyday no one can take these things away
We all want love and that's okay,
Maybe there's someone.
When my song has slipped away
And the darkness swallows the day
Another one's not very far away, so baby just hold on.
Baby just hold on

I want somewhere to go when it's too noisy in my head
Verbal vertigo I want to hear my voice instead
I need some way to lose this fear of falling down
'Cause I can still dance when my feet are on the ground

And at the end of everyday no one can take these things away
We all want love and that's okay,
Maybe there's someone.
When my song has slipped away
And the darkness swallows the day
Another one's not very far away, so baby just hold on.
Baby just hold on

If you could see behind my eyes
Indigo and ivory
Overwhelmed in outer space
Spinning round and round and chasing
Fairy tales and shooting stars
How I wonder where we are
In this life we'll be all right
All we gotta do is hold on tight

At the end of everyday no one can take these things away
We all want love and that's okay,
Maybe there's someone.
When my song has slipped away
And the darkness swallows the day
Another one's not very far away, so baby just hold on.
