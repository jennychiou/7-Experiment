I don't know why I thought that I could make you happy
These tears I cry for you are so hopeless, yeah
I don't know why I thought that we were going somewhere
But you grabbed your coat and you were out the door
And now I know you don't care

I know you're gonna take your love and run
I know you think I'm the foolish one
I know you're gonna turn around and say goodbye

I used to think you were my pretty angel comin' down
Well now you've just proven me wrong
What about the letters we have written
All the things we've said and done
I'll just stand here while you count the battles you have won

But I'm not gonna cry for you
'Cause that's what you want me to do
No I'm not gonna cry for you anymore

Take your love and run from me
Is this the way love's supposed to be
You don't think that I can see
But you can't fool me

But I'm not gonna cry for you
'Cause that's what you want me to do
No I'm not gonna cry for you anymore
