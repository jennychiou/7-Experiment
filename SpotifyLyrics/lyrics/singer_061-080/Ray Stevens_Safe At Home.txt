Remember back when working hard
That baseball games and grandma jar
Appetites grew strong in the Georgia sun

'Bout the time you could smell the meal
With clean hand in center field
Someone would holler at, "Dinners on"

And no matter who the battle won
We'd stop and drop our baseball gloves
Head for the water pump to wash our hands

All stars bowed their heads in grace
Each one with its own home plate
Filled with the fruits of their labor from our land

And we were family
Family with resemblances too strong for us to see
We're family, ageless family
And safe at home is all we longed to be

I can still see little brother's face
As he slit wide eyed in the second base
And countless times I've wished we could return

It's in that moment seems so clear
Just who we are, why we're here
And I pray that someday soon the world will learn

We're family
Big family with resemblances too strong for us to see
We're family, ageless family
And safe at home is all we longed to be
