You looked at my face
Thought you could get me
Better look twice
It won't be that easy
Think it's because
You're a little older
All you'll get from me
Is my cold shoulder

You shouldn't judge
Someone by what you see
You may be wrong
Like you were about me

I'm not too young
To know
The right things to do
And one of those things
Is not to fall for you
Boy I don't want no play
Didn't you hear me say
I'm not gonna fall for you
So please just go away

Didn't work out
The way that you planned
Bragged to your friends
Said you were the man
Now whatcha gonna do
Since your plan is blown
Couldn't get this little girl
Now you're crying all alone

Too bad you judged me
By first sight
It's too late now
So kiss this chance goodnight

I'm not too young
To know
The right things to do
And one of those things
Is not to fall for you
Boy I don't want no play
Didn't ya hear me say?
I'm not gonna fall for you
So please just go away

You say you want me
When you don't really know who I am
I don't wanna play no games
So catch me if you can

Didn't work out
The way that you planned
Bragged to your friends
Said you were the man
Now whatcha gonna do
Since your plan is blown
Couldn't get this little girl
Couldn't get this little girl
Now you're crying all alone
I'm not too young
To know
The right things to do
And one of those things
Is not to fall for you
Boy I don't want no play
Didn't ya hear me say?
I'm not gonna fall for you
So please just go away
Please just go away

I'm not too young
To know
The right things to do
And one of those things
Is not to fall for you
Boy I don't want no play
Didn't ya hear me say?
I'm not gonna fall for you

So please just go away
