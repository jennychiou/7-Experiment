If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move

It seems to me is what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
Stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece

And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece

'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light

It seem to me is what you're like
The ""look, but please don't touch me"" type
And honestly it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece
And I can't tell you why

It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece

And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece

And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece

And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
