Walk Away  

When I woke up today
I could have sworn you were the man that would never betray
I could have sworn you were my life and my dream and my faith
But in one moment you took that all away

Did you break me to see if I'd break
Did you wanna know what I was made of
Big mistake
'Cause there's nothing now
That you or anyone can say
So save your breath and walk away

And your excuses, they make me wanna scream
I could have sworn you were the man that would never never be mean
I could have sworn you were the light in the end of the dark for me
But you proved that
It's never what it seems

Did you break me to see if I'd break
Did you wanna know what I was made of
Big mistake
'Cause there's nothing now
That you or anyone can say
So save your breath and walk away

How can I look at you the same way
Nothing is the same as it was
How can I touch you in same way
We'll never be the same

Did you break me to see if I'd break
Did you wanna know what I was made of
Big mistake
'Cause there's nothing now
That you or anyone can say
So save your breath and walk away

Just save your breath and walk away
Oh, no, Who knows I could have sworn you were the man that would never betray
