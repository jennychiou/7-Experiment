She walks like an angel walks
She talks like an angel talks
And her hair has a kind of curl
To my mind, she's my kind of girl

She's wise like an angel's wise
With eyes like an angel's eyes
And a smile like a kind of pearl
To my mind, she's my kind of girl

A pretty little face, that face just knocks me off of my feet
Pretty little feet, she's really sweet enough to eat
She looks like an angel looks
Baby, I'm hooked after just one look
And my mind's in a kind of whirl
Cause to my mind, she's my kind of girl

That pretty little face, that face just knocks me off of my feet
Pretty little feet, she's really sweet enough to eat
She looks like an angel looks
Oh, I'm cooked after just one look
And my mind's in a kind of whirl
Cause in my mind, she's my kind of girl

And my heart has a kind of joy
Cause in her mind, I'm just her kind of boy
