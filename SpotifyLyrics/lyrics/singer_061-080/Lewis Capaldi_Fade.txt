It ain't no wonder why we lose control
When we're always a heart attack away from falling in love
Well, I know that we've been hardly holding on
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far
Running near on empty
I wish somebody would've told me

That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me
Girl, you make my heart break more every day
But don't fade away

And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs
And now it's so hard to be
I wish somebody would've told me

That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me
Girl, you make my heart break more every day

Well, I know that we've been hardly holding on
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far, oh
Well, I know that we've been hardly holding on
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far
I wish somebody would've told me
I wish somebody would've told me

That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess I'm such a fucking fool for the way that you caught me
Girl, you make my heart break more every day

But don't fade away (well, I know that we've been hardly holding on)
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far
Don't fade away (well, I know that we've been hardly holding on)
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far
So don't fade away
