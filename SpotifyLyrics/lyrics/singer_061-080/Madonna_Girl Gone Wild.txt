Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pain of Hell
But most of all because I love thee
And I want so badly to be good

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet

It's so erotic "(erotic)"
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's comin' right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums!
It's got me singing

Hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor till the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinnin'
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away

I feel like sinnin'
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favourite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's comin' right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums!
It's got me singing

Hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor till the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave... misbehave
But I'm a bad girl anyway, hey!

Forgive me

Hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like hey-ay-ay-ay-eh-ay-ay-ay
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor till the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
