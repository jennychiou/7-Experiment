Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever - when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the the morning
Fever all through the night.

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever - when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the the morning
Fever all through the night.

Everybody's got the fever,
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing,
Fever started long ago.

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said "Julie baby you're my flame"
Thou givest fever
When we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.

Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy-O don't you dare"
Give me fever - with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever - I'm his Missus
Oh daddy won't you treat him right.

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, 
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever - when you kiss them, 
Fever if you live and learn
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.
