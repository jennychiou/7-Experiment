I ain't never read the Wall Street Journal,
I ain't no PH.D.
The Trickle Down theory and the Laffer Curve,
Are just Greek to me.

I'm ignorant about inflation,
And the Federal Reserve T-note.
I ain't never had a lesson in the Great Depression,
But, this much I know.

We're all working for the Japanese,
Little cars and color TV's.
Sending all our money overseas,
To the Eastern 'sphere.

One day we're gonna lose our roots,
Wear Oriental jeans and boots.
And, drink nothing, but Kawasaki saki, Honda wine, and Mitsubishi light beer.

Chrysler fights for survival,
So does General Motors.
Ford perseveres with better ideas,
And, everybody drives Toyotas.

Sony owns the Rockefeller Center,
And, the Hawaiian archipelago.
We buy Seiko's, walkman's, TV's, and minivans,
And, wonder where the money all goes.

Just working for the Japanese,
Little cars and color TV's.
Sending all our money overseas,
To the Eastern 'sphere.

One day we're gonna lose our roots,
Wear Oriental jeans and boots.
And, drink nothing, but Kawasaki saki, Honda wine, and Mitsubishi light beer.

I'm gonna gather up all my dollars,
Trade 'em in for Yen.
Get up and go to Tokyo,
Start over again.

Gonna change my name to Yamada,
Marry me a geisha wife.
And, eat nutritious dishes like little raw fishes,
And, be happy for the rest of my life.

While you're a-workin' for the Japanese,
Little cars and color TV's.
Sending all your money overseas,
To the Eastern 'sphere.

One day you're gonna roose your loots, (Asian dialect intended)
Where Oriental jeans and boots.
And, drink nothing but Kawasaki saki, Honda wine, and Mitsubishi right beer. (Asian dialect intended)

You're gonna love that,
Kawasaki saki, Honda wine, and Mitsubishi light beer.

Ah-so!
