I got early up mornings, shower and shave.
No time to feel alone.
I got do my job daytimes work like a slave.
Don't even notice she's gone.
I got meet my friends evening's over a beer.
Laughing and talking no sadness here.
All too soon they disappear.
Guess it's time for me to go home?

That's when I miss those Mary Lou Nights.
That's when I feel that emptiness as I turn out my lights.
I try to sleep and dream about her as I fold my pillow tight,
Oh how I miss those Mary Lou Nights.

I found some little places I go to eat.
They serve me home cooked meals.
There's that great little laundry just down the street.
We've made us a deal.
I'm wearing clean shirts and I guess I'm well fed.
I don't feel the hurt stayin' home instead of here.
Except late at night when I turn down by bed and I finally face how I feel.

That's when I miss those Mary Lou Nights.
That's when I feel that emptiness as I turn out my lights.
I try to sleep and dream about her as I fold my pillow tight,
Oh how I miss those Mary Lou Nights.

Oh how I miss those Mary Lou Nights.
