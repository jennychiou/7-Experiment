Cut me down the middle
Fucked me up a little
You said I was your queen
I tried to give you everything
And now you want your freedom

You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
Now I'm no longer needed

You said it was over
Wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say
That we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking
And I'm the last to know

Now I'm in the middle of HeartBreakCity "(HeartBreakCity)"
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty "(world not pretty)"
Your clever game got the best of me "(best of me)"
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me "(rest of me)"
'Cause I'm in HeartBreakCity

Tore me into pieces
Didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess

I curse the day we met
Your memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

You said it was over
Wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say
That we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking
And I'm the last to know 

I'm in the middle of HeartBreakCity "(HeartBreakCity)"
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty "(world not pretty)"
Your clever game got the best of me "(best of me)"
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me "(rest of me)"
'Cause I'm in HeartBreakCity
And it's not that pretty
