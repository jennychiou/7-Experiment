One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

Boy I wanna be where you are
Don't matter if you're near or you're far
You fill up my heart 
All the way to the top,
And it's you 
I'm loving for always

Catch me
I'm a shooting star
Make a wish
Close your eyes
Cross your heart
Your love is so rare
And I'm glad 
That you're here in my arms
I'll love you for always

Dreaming
Of you tonight
Praying that you will be mine
Hoping
You'll be holding me tight
Never ever letting me go
I need you to know (know)

One, two, three, four
You came into my life
Made everything go right
So sweet and tenderly
Unlock my love
You've got the key
Ooh, I'm so satisfied
This kind of love I just can't hide
I'm gonna love you for always

I'm gonna love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Yeah

Took my heart for a carousel ride
Made me feel
Brand new inside
When I'm with you
All that I seem to do is smile
I'll love you for always

Boy I'm floating on a cloud
Wanna scream and shout it loud
I found amazing grace
In your eyes
And your face
I'm in love
With you for always 

Dreaming
Of you tonight
Praying that you will be mine
Hoping
You'll be holding me tight
Never ever letting me go
I need you to know (know)

One, two, three, four
You came into my life
Made everything go right
So sweet and tenderly
Unlock my love
You've got the key
Ooh, I'm so satisfied
This kind of love I just can't hide
I'm gonna love you for always

I'm gonna love you for always
I'm gonna love you for always, 
It's true
I'm gonna love you for always
I'm gonna love you for always
For always
