Lately I've been trying
To fill up my days since you're gone
The speed of love is blinding
And I didn't know how to hold on

My mind won't clear
I'm out of tears
My heart's got no room left inside

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

Will the arms of hope surround me
Will time be a fair weather friend
Should I call out to angels
Or just drink myself sober again

Can't hide it, it's true
I still burn for you
Your memory just won't let me go

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

I'd hold you tighter
Closer than ever before
Yeah
No flame would burn brighter
If I could touch you once more
Hold you once more

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

Until I find you

Again
