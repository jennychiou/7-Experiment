I don't like cities
But I like New York
Other places
Make me feel like a dork

Los Angeles is for
People who sleep
Paris and London
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep

Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made glad
Except like New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

If you don't like my attitude
Then you can f off
Just go to Texas
Isn't that where they golf?

New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street

Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

I love New York (Get off of my street)
I love New York (Get off of my street)
I love New York (Get off of my street)
I love New York (Get off of my street)
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
Then get off my street
