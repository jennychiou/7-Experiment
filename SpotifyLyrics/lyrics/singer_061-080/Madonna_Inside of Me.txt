I can't stop thinking of you
The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared
I'll always find them there
In my memories

But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me
I'm crying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

You'll always be inside of my heart
Inside of me

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love still carries on

I will always feel you
You'll always be inside of my heart
I'll always have you inside of me
I will always have you
