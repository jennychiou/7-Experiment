It's gonna be a big heart breaker
Grandma needs a new pace maker
And the doctor says, "I realize she's ill"
But there's talk of legislation on all our medication
And maybe all we can do is put her on a pain pill

Whoa, me, hey, Congress

You vote Obamacare, we'll vote you outta there
We the people have awakened to your tricks
You vote to let this pass, you'll be out on your
'Cause we the people have awakened

And to put it in words you might understand
If you had the common sense that God gave a billy goat
You'd no doubt noticed that your constituents
The electorate, that's us, voters
Are onto your pork-barrel-special-interest-tax-and-spend-scam
Or, to put it more succinctly, "Heh, heh, heh, pff"

We've heard from Hannity, Beck, and Limbaugh
What you've got in mind for grandma
And we found this O'Reilly fella on Fox
We're kinda like Joe the Plumber
And when we crunch the numbers
It all adds up to votin' you out at the ballot box

Heh heh heh heh

You vote Obamacare, we're gonna vote you outta there
We the People have awakened to your tricks
You vote to let this pass, you're gonna be out on your
'Cause we the people have awakened

And to put it mildly, we're harboring feelings of extreme alienation
Due to copious amounts of horse manure
That have been shoveled out of the White House
And the Capitol Building

And we sense that we are being royally defecated upon, ha ha
Yeah, we're gettin' the impression that you think
We are not relevant to these proceedings
And dismissing our input into the situation

Please tell Nancy Pelosi
We're gonna do the Hokey Pokey
Put the right ones in
Pull the left ones out

You vote Obamacare, we're gonna vote you outta there
We the People have awakened to your tricks
You vote to let this pass, you're gonna be out on your
Yeah, we the people have awakened

And you might want to start looking for another line of work
How 'bout the medical profession? Ha, ha
Yeah, they're gonna need every one that can put up
With the red tape and the pay cut

Hey, why don't you kill every last job
Tax every last penny and infringe on every God-given
Right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?
'Cause let me tell you, ain't nobody happy with you

We the people have awakened
And it occurs to me that
You might really like it down in Venezuela
