Don't put me off 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough

I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up

I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

You're always closing your door
Well that only makes me want you more
And day and night I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough

To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind and I know
That you want to want me but you can't let go
Come on, let go

I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

Oh

Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Or bending over backwards now would you be pleased?
Unlike the others I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire

Come on, let go

Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Or bending over backwards now would you be pleased?
Unlike the others I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire

(Burning up for your love)
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up (Burning up for your love)
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up (Burning up for your love)
Come on, come on, I'm burning up (Burning up for your love)
Uh, uh, uh, I'm burning up (Burning up for your love)

Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up (Burning up for your love)
Come on, come on, I'm burning up (Burning up for your love)
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up (Burning up for your love)
Uh, uh, uh (Burning up for your love)

You know you got me burning up, baby (Burning up for your love)
You know you got me burning up, baby (Burning up for your love)

Burning up for your love (Burning up for your love)
Burning up for your love (Burning up for your love)
Burning up for your love (Burning up for your love)
Burning up for your love (Burning up for your love)
