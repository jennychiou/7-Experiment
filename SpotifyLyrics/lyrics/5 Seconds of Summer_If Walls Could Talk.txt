If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk

If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk

If these walls could talk
