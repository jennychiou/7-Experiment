You have - You have - You have Email!

(Hootie-hoo!)

Ain't no doubt about it
I can't wait to get home to you
(I gotta get home, yeah, uh, uh, come on woo)
Connected with my baby
Just jammin' online with you
(Online, online, online)

Here in the room we are as one
(Together you and me, together you and me)
Hours connect
As we switch on (switch on)

She's my best kept secret
My internet girl (my internet girl oh)
She's my one and only
And I ain't tellin' the world (my internet girl oh)

She's my best kept secret
Hooked up online with that girl
(My internet girl oh)
She's my one and only, my internet girl
(My internet girl oh)
My internet girl, my internet girl.

Surfin' through my windows
Gotta find my way back to you
(I gotta find away, gotta find a way)
(I gotta find a way, gotta find a way)

You left me mail in the inbox
Thinkin' about what we should do
(I will type again girlfriend, so tell me, tell me what you wanna do)

You left me the password to your heart
(Yeah, that's it. I got it.)
No lookin' back we clicked from the start
(Click click...)
I wanna let you know
She's mine

She's my best kept secret
My internet girl (my internet girl oh)
She's my one and only
And I ain't tellin' the world (my internet girl oh)

She's my best kept secret
My internet girl (my internet girl oh)
She's my one and only
And I ain't tellin' the world (my internet girl oh)

Uh uh uh uh c'mon
Here we go...

She's my best kept secret
My internet girl (my internet girl oh)
She's my one and only
And I ain't tellin' the world (my internet girl)

She's my best kept secret
Hooked up online with that girl
My internet girl
She's my one and only
My internet girl (my internet girl)
She's my best kept secret
My internet girl (my internet girl oh)
She's my one and only...

Talking: All I can think about all day
Is gettin' home to my computer
So I can see your voice
