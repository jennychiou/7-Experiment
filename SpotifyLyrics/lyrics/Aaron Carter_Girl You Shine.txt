I see you everyday
And I can't seem to think
Of anything to say
To you baby
How can it be
That breaks my heart
When you're smiling at me

The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true

Girl you shine, like the reflections on the water
Girl you shine, like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine, like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you shine, like the stars in the sky

In you I see
Something I won't find
Never again
Baby you're always on my mind
If I could find a way
To open up my heart
We'd be together
We'd not be apart

The moment that I laid my eyes my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true


Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're going to make my dreams come true
You know I'll never leave you
I'll never deceive you
I'll give you every piece of my heart

Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me


You're all I need to survive
And girl you keep me alive
And girl you shine
Like the sun in the sky
