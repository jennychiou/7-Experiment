Sometime, someplace
Everybody has words
Fallin' out, and making up

Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal

But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, I listen to the sound
You and I get, and everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time

(Yeah, yeah)
1, 2, 3, 4

You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane
You and I have much to give
Everything is relative When we have our darker days
We just go our separate ways
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane yeah yeah
1, 2, 3, 4

Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal

But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, I listen to the sound
You and I get, and everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time yeah yeah

Sometimes baby in your eyes
Love is truly justified
When I hear you tellin' lies
I just wanna terrorize
Making up is oh so good
Yeah we rock the neighborhood
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane yeah yeah
1-2-3-4

Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal

But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, I listen to the sound
You and I get, everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal

But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, I listen to the sound
You and I get, everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time yeah yeah
