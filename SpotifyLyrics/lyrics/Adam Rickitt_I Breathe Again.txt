I breathe again
I breathe again
I breathe again

When you're not here minutes feel like days
And I wait to hold you in my arms
Fever breaks, my body aches
But I'm strong and I'll hold on
Open the doors feel the need in me
Come and take, come and take this pain away
Babe your love is like oxygen through my veins
And I need it

I feel my body shake and my heart's about to fail
A panic attack and I can't exhale
But baby all I need's
Your lovin' medication

You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
When you hold me (I breathe again)
When you near me (I breathe again)
When you touch me (I breathe again)

I want to wake lying next to you
Where I'm safe and far away from harm
Nothing takes my breathe away
Like the thought of you gone

I feel your body burn, we move in time
You're givin' me life with your mouth to mine
And baby I can feel
You heal my soul
I breathe again

You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
When you hold me (I breathe again)
When you near me (I breathe again)
When you touch me (I breathe again)

I feel my body shake and my heart's about to fail
A panic attack and I can't exhale
But baby all I need's
Your lovin' medication

You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
When you hold me (I breathe again)
When you near me (I breathe again)
When you touch me (I breathe again)

You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
When you hold me (I breathe again)
When you near me (I breathe again)
When you touch me (I breathe again)
