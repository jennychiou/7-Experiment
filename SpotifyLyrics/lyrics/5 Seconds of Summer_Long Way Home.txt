Take me back to the middle of nowhere
Back to the place only you and I share
Remember all the memories?
The fireflies and make-believe
Kicking back in the old school yard
Singing songs on our guitars
This is our reality
Crazy stupid, you and me

We know this is the way it's supposed to be

So we're taking the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with you, talkin' 'bout nothing, yeah whatever, babe
So we're taking the long way home tonight

Now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere
Yeah you know we took our time to get there
We're hiding out in a dream
Catching fire like kerosene
And you know I'd never let you down
'Til the sun comes up, we can own this town
Something like make-believe
Living in a movie scene

I know this is the way it's supposed to be

So we're taking the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with you, talkin' 'bout nothing, yeah whatever, babe
So we're taking the long way home

Hitting every red light
Kissing at the stop signs, darling
Green Day's on the radio
And everything is alright
Now we're turning off the headlights, darling
We're just taking it slow

So we're taking the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with you, talkin' 'bout nothing, yeah whatever, babe
So we're taking the long way home

Hitting every red light
Kissing at the stop signs, darling
Green Day's on the radio
And everything is alright
Now we're turning off the headlights, darling
We're just taking it slow

Taking the long way home
Taking the long way home
Taking the long way home
