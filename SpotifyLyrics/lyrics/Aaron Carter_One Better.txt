Give me a half a chance
I'll make you understand
That what I've got to give
Is so much more than this
Than you'll ever know

I don't say what's on my mind
But you'll find this out in time
Don't always open up
I'm not quick to trust
And let someone inside

I've got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I've got to say what's right for me

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
Yeah
I'll be the one you can believe
I'll be one better
Yeah
I'll be one better

You've seen some falling stars
You've felt a broken heart
Time is all it takes
Learn from my mistakes
Know exactly what you are

But I can't hang on the side
Had enough of all these fights
Got to get to you
Got to get this through
Till you realize

I've got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I got to say what's right for me

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
Yeah
I'll be the one you can believe
I'll be one better
Yeah

I won't back down
No never, no never
You don't have to be alone

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
I'll be one better
Oh...

I'll be one better
Oh...
I'll be one better
