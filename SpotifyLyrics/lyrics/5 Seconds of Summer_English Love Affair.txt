It started out one weekend in May,
I was looking for attention
Needed intervention
Felt somebody looking at me
With a powder white complexion
Feeling the connection
The way she looked is so ridiculous
Every single step had me waiting for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me out the bar to the backseat of a car

When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
I can't forget my English love affair
Today, I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head on a king sized bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
My English love affair

Next thing we were back at her place
A hideaway in Mayfair
All the great and good there
Drinking all the way to third base
Princess getting naked
Falling on their faces
The storyline is so ridiculous
Every single step had me begging for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me up the stairs and it wasn't ending there

When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
Can't forget my English love affair
Today, I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head on a king sized bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair

When I got out I knew
That nobody I knew would be believing me
I look back now and know
That nobody could ever take the memory

When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
Can't forget my English love affair
Today, I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head on a king sized bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
My English love affair
My English love affair
