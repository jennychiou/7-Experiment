Here's a little bit of old school for ya
That goes a little something like this

I always tried to be the fliest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
Throw the party of the month
Nah, the party of the year

All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
Nah, send 'em to a show
Let me think, hmm
It's gotta be long though

I said mom, dad, yo why ya sittin' home
It's a Friday night, have you seen aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone

Have a good time

The door bell rings 'cause the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's new year
Walkin' 'round the house like who's da man
(Can't nobody do it like Aaron can)

First one on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I guess somewhere along I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around come on
(Come get it)
What?
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh, what what
(Come get it)
(Come get it)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Things are goin' great then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellows yo, ya gotta get out
(Hey man, I heard this was an open house)
Open house?
(Yeah, that's what the flyers said)
I didn't put out flyers
(Well somebody did)

Later walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On, my mom's new cushion

I turned around
Another kid broke a lamp
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
But now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
'Cause there's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around come on
(Come get it))
What?
(Come get it)
Say it again, here we go, uh
(Come get it)

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh, what what
(Come get it)
(Come get it)

(Aaron C's in the house, here we go)
Yeah yeah yeah
(Come with it)
Break it down
(Go go go)

Is that a car door
Oh, dang I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double
I'm dead that's it for me
(Your done)
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree

Once mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't wanna even start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin' around the house, tryin' to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test

The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life was good with 10 seconds left
(Aaron)
Grounded

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(Come get it)
Jump all around come on
(Come get it)
What?
(Come get it)
Say it again here we go, uh
(Come get it)

People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise

Aron C's in the house, come on
(Come get it)
Uh uh, what what

(Come get it)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
