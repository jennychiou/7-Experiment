Six weeks since I've been away
And now you're saying everything has changed
And I'm afraid that I might be losing you
And every night that we spend alone
It kills me thinking of you on your own
And I wish I was back home next to you

Oh, everyday you feel a little bit further away
And I don't know what to say

Are we wasting time talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up, even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

Late night calls and another text
Is this as good as we're gonna get?
Another time-zone taking me away from you
Living dreams in fluorescent lights
While you and I are running out of time
But you know that I'll always wait for you

Oh, everyday you feel a little bit further away
And I don't know what to say

Are we wasting time talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up, even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

On the phone, I can tell that you wanna move on
Through the tears I can hear that I shouldn't have gone
Every day it gets harder to stay away from you

So tell me are we wasting time talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers

Wasting time talking on a broken line
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up, even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

Six months since I went away
And I know everything has changed
But tomorrow I'll be coming back to you
