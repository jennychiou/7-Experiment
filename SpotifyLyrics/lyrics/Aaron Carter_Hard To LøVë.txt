I wake her up before she wanna
She get the best from me
I put in work so she can't think that
It all comes easily

Always telling her something
Always rushing and running
If I'm late to the stage 'cause we doing our thing
I'll be blaming our loving
In the studio, busting
She be pushing my buttons
But it's better than nothing, yeah

No more problems, I can solve 'em
I know that I can stop 'em, I'll be real for once in my life
So for once in your life

I need you to relate, I need you to be patient
It ain't easy to deal with, baby, it's only because
I'm hard to love because I love too hard
Maybe, I'm hard to love because I love too hard
Maybe, I'm hard to love, hard to love
Maybe, I'm hard to love, hard to love

Hard to love

She wake me up before I wanna
She makes it hard to breathe
I put in work so she can think that
My love is luxury

Always telling her something
Always rushing and running
If I'm late to the stage 'cause we doing our thing
I'll be blaming our loving
In the studio, busting
She be pushing my buttons
But it's better than nothing, yeah

No more problems, I can solve 'em
I know that I can stop 'em, I'll be real for once in my life
So for once in your life

I need you to relate, I need you to be patient
It ain't easy to deal with, baby, it's only because
I'm hard to love because I love too hard
Maybe, I'm hard to love because I love too hard
Maybe, I'm hard to love, hard to love
Maybe, I'm hard to love, hard to love

Maybe, I'm hard to love because I love too hard
Maybe, I'm hard to love, hard to love
Maybe, I'm hard to love, hard to love
