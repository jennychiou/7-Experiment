Another day of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away, lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine

I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Wasted days, dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
It seems I just lost track
Looking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away

I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? 
Invisible

Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Another day, the walls are built to keep me safe
I can't escape, it's too late
