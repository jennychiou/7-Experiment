Free child, time is on our side
Free child, where's the freedom we will ride
As time child, runs to make a stand
Time child, 'cause destiny is in my hand

We enter life with rules
We're told this is the way
Decisions made for us
In which we have no say
What right have they to judge
The way our life should be
A generation fuelled by ignorance and greed

'Cause we are calling out to the children of the world
As we forget the past and the future's ours
To fill new life without hurt

Free child, time is on our side
Free child, where's the freedom we will ride
As time child, runs to make a stand
Time child, 'cause destiny is in my hand

The future calls your name
And now your time has come
To realise your dreams
Before your chance has gone

Free child, time is on our side
Free child, where's the freedom we will ride
As time child, runs to make a stand
Time child, 'cause destiny is in my hand

'Cause the sands of time
Have been washed away
And we have come too far
For us to throw it all away away away...

Free to walk and cry

Free child, time is on our side
Free child, where's the freedom we will ride
As time child, runs to make a stand
Time child, 'cause destiny is in my hand
