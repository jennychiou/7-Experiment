Tell me darling, do you love him
Has he touched your soul?
Do you need him, to keep breathing
Has he made you whole?

'Cause when I sleep at night
I dream I hold you tight
Feel you close to me
Kiss you tenderly

Give me your heart, I'll keep it safe
Baby I promise that I'll never stray
Give me your heart, I'm here to stay
Baby I'll show you that we are the same

Does he love you, protect and console you
Like you wanted him to?
Or does he hurt you, betray and desert you
That's one thing I'd never do...

When I sleep at night
I dream I hold you tight
Feel you close to me
Kiss you tenderly

Give me your heart, I'll keep it safe
Baby I promise that I'll never stray
Give me your heart, I'm here to stay
Baby I'll show you that we are the same

Give me your heart
Never never
Give me your heart
Baby I'll show you that we are the same

Give me your heart, I'll keep it safe
Baby I promise that I'll never stray
Give me your heart, I'm here to stay
Baby I'll show you that we are the same
