I got everything, but you don't seem to want it
Why don't you practice what you preach 'cause this ain't fair
I'll give you everything, but you think something's missing (what's missing)
Why don't you practice what you preach 'cause this ain't fair

Dearly, dearly, I know you feel lost
Dearly, dearly, I know that you're gone
When are you coming home?

Finish what you started
Dearly departed
If this ain't what you wanted
Dearly departed, departed

And I got all this love, but you think something's missing (what's missing)
Why don't you practice what you preach 'cause this ain't fair
I know you play these games and we both know I like it (I like it)
Why don't you practice what you preach 'cause this ain't fair

Dearly, dearly, I know you feel lost
Dearly, dearly, I know that you're gone
When are you coming home?

Finish what you started
Dearly departed
If this ain't what you wanted
Dearly departed, departed

Finish what you started
Dearly departed
If this ain't what you wanted
Dearly departed, departed

Finish what you started
Dearly departed
If this ain't what you wanted
Dearly departed, departed
