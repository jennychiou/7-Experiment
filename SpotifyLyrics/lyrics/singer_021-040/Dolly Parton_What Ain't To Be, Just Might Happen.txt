I've learned to live my life just a little bit lighter
Gonna look on the lonely days just a little bit brighter
My heart's been throwed around and it ain't done enough laughin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good to worry none just turns your hair gray while you're young
Love can make you sing start your hands a clappin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen

Why you can't never tell when love might find you
It could be miles away or right behind you
Some makes you hurt real bad some makes you happy
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
Don't do no good to worry none...

I had a love one time sent me out on a ledge
Well it's fourteen stories high standin' on the edge
I don't want that kind no more to start my world a crackin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
Don't do no good to worry none...
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
