(Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)

Wrap me in everything that glows
Light it up, light it up, light it up
I found my skin underneath my clothes
Light it up, light it up, light it up
When everyone said that I lost my mind
You're the one that got me through those times
Everyone said that I lost my mind
Wrap me in everything that glows
Light it up, light it up, light it up

When everything was getting harder
You gave me your heart, you gave me your heart
When everything was getting louder
You gave me your heart, you gave me your heart

You wrap me up in stars when I'm feeling the darkness
You keep me on the ground when I light up the sky
You kiss me on my scars when you know I've been broken
When I was letting go you taught me how to fly
And hold on
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
(You taught me how to fly)
And hold on
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
(You taught me how to fly)

You put me in somewhere no one knows
With your love, with your love, with your love
I'll never be, never be alone
With your love, with your love, with your love
When everyone said that I lost my mind
You're the one that got me through those times
Everyone said that I lost my mind
You put me in somewhere no one knows
With your love, with your love, with your love

When everything was getting harder
You gave me your heart, you gave me your heart
When everything was getting louder
You gave me your heart, you gave me your heart

You wrap me up in stars when I'm feeling the darkness
You keep me on the ground when I light up the sky
You kiss me on my scars when you know I've been broken
When I was letting go you taught me how to fly
And hold on
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
(You taught me how to fly)
And hold on
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
(You taught me how to fly)

When everything was getting harder
You gave me your heart
When everything was getting louder
You gave me your heart

You wrap me up in stars when I'm feeling the darkness
You keep me on the ground when I light up the sky
You kiss me on my scars when you know I've been broken
When I was letting go you taught me how to fly
And hold on
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
(You taught me how to fly)
And hold on
(Hold on, hold on, hold on)
(You taught me how to fly)
And hold on
(Hold on, hold on)
