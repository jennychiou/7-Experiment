I'm solid, not apparition
Better check your vision, see what you're missing, boy
I don't need your permission
To go on existing with or without you, boy
I ain't gonna let it go, 'cause this been going on too long

I won't be another ghost
No, I won't be invisible
See me everywhere you go
No, I won't be invisible, yeah

Invisible
Invis-invisible

I had my suspicions, you kept me at a distance
I ain't disappearing, boy
I thought you were worth it
Pulling back the curtain
I see why I was hurting boy
I ain't gonna let it go
Now you see me with the lights on

I won't be another ghost
No, I won't be invisible
See me everywhere you go
No, I won't be invisible, yeah

Invisible
Invis-invisible

I won't be diminished, eclipsed, or hidden
You're gonna see my light blaze black to life
Like the phoenix rise
I won't be diminished, eclipsed, or hidden
You're gonna see my light blaze black to life
Like the phoenix rise

Invisible
Invisible
Invisible, tonight
