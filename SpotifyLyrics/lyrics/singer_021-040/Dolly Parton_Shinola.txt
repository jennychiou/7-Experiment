You got a snazzy new car in your driveway
Expensive new clothes on your back
Every short skirt on the highway
Has spent time in your bachelor pad

We dance and you look over my shoulder
And make eyes at somebody else
You swear that you're not, but you know that's a croc
Cause you only care for yourself

Your attitude stinks and I hate it
You're arrogant, cocky, and rude
You're selfish, conceited, and jaded
Everything's all about you
You think that I'm lucky to have you
You think you're so handsome, so what
I'm callin' you out 'cause I don't need this crap
I'm gettin' myself outta Dodge

Cause you don't know love from Shinola
With you love is not what I found
A woman needs someone to hold her
Not someone to just lay her down
I want someone I can count on
A cool headed, warm heart and shoulder
To cry on, rely on, today and from now on
But you don't know love from Shinola

You don't know love from Shinola

Oh but I gave you love and affection
But you never gave one iota
It was an early detection
That you don't know love from Shinola

You don't know love from shinola
You don't know what true loves about

Well you'll find your world growin' colder
When you're alone and without
So go on, lover boy, have a big time
Drink up on your Bourbon and cola
When you sober up you'll be *beep* outta luck
Cause you don't know love from Shinola

I'm in it for love, but you're just plain stuck
You don't know love from Shinola

You don't know love, you don't know love
You don't know love from Shinola
No, you don't know love from Shinola
You don't know love, you don't know love
