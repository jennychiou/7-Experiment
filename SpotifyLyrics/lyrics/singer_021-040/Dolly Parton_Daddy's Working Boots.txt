My dear hard workin' daddy works his life away for us 
That's the way that daddy shows to us his love 
And Daddy's two hard working hands 
They're callous and they're sore 
And Daddy's workin' boots have walked a million miles or more 
As long as I remember, I remember Daddy workin' 
Workin' on the job or either on the farm 
Tryin' to provide for the family that he loves 
And Daddy's working boots have taken many steps for us 

Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation 
Though just like him, they're tired and worn 
For years they've helped him stand 
Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation 
They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man 

Dear lord above, I know up there my Daddy's got a mansion 
And a great reward that's long been overdue 
And when it comes my Daddy's time to be with you in heaven 

Won't cha let him walk your golden streets 
In a pair of brand new golden boots 

Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation 
Though just like him, they're tired and worn 
For years they've helped him stand 
Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation 
They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man 

Daddy's workin' boots
