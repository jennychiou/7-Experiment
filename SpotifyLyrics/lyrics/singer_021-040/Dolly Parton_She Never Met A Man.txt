I know you think you love her and you're making plans to leave
But I must tell you something I just hope you'll believe
I know it isn't real love that you see in her eyes
'Cause she's never met a man she didn't like
And you're no different from the others
A new acquaintance in the night
You mean no more to her than all the others she's held tight
But I know she's convinced you it was love at first sight
But she's never met a man she didn't like

I must let you go but I want you to know
That I love you please don't let her ruin our lives
For there'll be other men and she won't want you then
She's never met a man she didn't like

I must let you go but I want you to know
That I love you please don't let her ruin our lives
For she'll have other men oh and she won't want you then
'Cause she's never met a man she didn't like
Oh no she's never met a man she didn't like
