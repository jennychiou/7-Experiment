I've got to tell you I've been rackin' my brain
Hopin' to find a way out
I've had enough of this continual rain
Changes are comin', no doubt

It's been a too long time
With no peace of mind
And I'm ready for the times
To get better

You seem to want from me what I cannot give
I feel so lonesome at times
I have a dream that I wish I could live
It's burnin' holes in my mind

It's been a too long time
With no peace of mind
And I'm ready for the times
To get better

Na, na, na...

It's been a too long time
With no peace of mind
And I'm ready for the times
To get better
