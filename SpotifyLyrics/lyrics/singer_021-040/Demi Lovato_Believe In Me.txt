I'm losing myself
Trying to compete
With everyone else
Instead of just being me

Don't know where to turn
I've been stuck in this routine
I need to change my ways
Instead of always being weak

I don't wanna be afraid
I wanna wake up feeling beautiful today
And know that I'm okay
'Cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
You see, I just wanna believe in me

La la la la
La la la la

The mirror can lie
It doesn't show you what's inside
And it, it can tell you you're full of life
It's amazing what you can hide
Just by putting on a smile

I don't wanna be afraid
I wanna wake up feeling beautiful today
And know that I'm okay
'Cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
You see, I just wanna believe in me

I'm quickly finding out
I'm not about to break down, not today
I guess I always knew
That I had all the strength to make it through

Not gonna be afraid
I'm gonna wake up feeling beautiful today
And know that I'm okay
'Cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
You see now, now I believe in me

Now I believe in me
