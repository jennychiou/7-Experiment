I can't even begin to tell you 
How I've been feelin' lately 
But I have stumbled across something rare 
And you use it to bait me 
Something tells me go 
Everyone says no, no, no 
How can they be so cruel 
When they tell me don't touch you 
I tell them I'll die 
In your red hot screaming love 
In your red hot screaming love 

If I'm losing my senses 
They're lost in your deepest emotions 
And the jets in my heart 
They won't start till you set them in motion 
Something tells me go 
Everyone says no, no, no 
How can they be so cruel 
When they tell me don't touch you 
I tell them I'll die 

In your red hot screaming love 
In your red hot screaming love
