Ooh

What happened?
Why didn't I listen to myself
I thought I'd know how to handle it
But I didn't

So confused
Where I stand
Do I stand alone
With each individual

This is not me
I used to be so strong
Now I feel weak

This is not me
I never said that it was
I didn't like it because I had lost my way
This is not me
You know that it's true
And I'd be lying to you just to convince myself
This is not me

What happened?
Why didn't I speak up at the time
I thought I'd know what was going on
But I didn't
So confused where I stand
Do I stand alone
With each individual

This is not me
I never said that it was
I didn't like it because I had lost my way
This is not me
You know that it's true
And I'd be lying to you just to convince myself

Whoo ooh yeah
Hey yeah

So confused where I stand
Do I stand alone
Someone tell me
Cause this is not me
I never said that it was
I didn't like it because I had lost my way
This is not me, you know that it's true
I'd be lying to you just to convince myself

This is not me
This is not me
I used to be so weak, and now I feel strong
Oh, yeah
