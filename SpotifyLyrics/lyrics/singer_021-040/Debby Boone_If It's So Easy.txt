They say that love is just a piece of cake
They tell me love is just a give and take
They make love sound like it comes easily
If it's so easy why was it so hard for me

They say that love will sparkle in his eyes
They tell me loves not hard to recognize
They make love sound like it's not hard to find
If it's that easy what was it made me so blind

If love is good
And love is great
Why don't they make a love
Too good to brake

My friends tell me that I will love again
But I am wiser now then I was then
I've seen how easy love
Can change its mind
Its just so easy that's why I'm so scared this time
Its just so easy that's why I'm so scared this time
