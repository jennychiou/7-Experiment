Welcome to Love City population two

It isn't a big place our little town
But it's filled with lovely sights all around
A park filled with flowers a beautiful lawn
The streets of the driveway that leads to our home
Just a small house on an acre of ground
We call it Love City our little town

Welcome to Love City polulation two
Founded on a little love that just grew and grew
Between me and you

We built our home on Love's Avenue
The taxes are low and it has a nice view
We've got home cooked meals that are fit for a king
And all kinds of love to fill every dream
A room just for friends if they happen to
Visit our Love City population two
