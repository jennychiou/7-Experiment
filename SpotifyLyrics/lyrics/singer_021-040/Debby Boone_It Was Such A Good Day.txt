I used to think I could stop the earth
And hold time in my hands
But I watched as it raced on by me
Heading for tomorrow
And I haven't the power to say
We can save today

For a little while longer
Just one tomorrow
Can I save today
It was such a good day
I want to remember
All of the good times
At the end of the day
To remember the good times

Before one more tomorrow
All shiny and new
Who'd believe that I'd ever
Be so close to you
When this day is over
And the sun leaves the sky
Let me see all the memories
While there clear in my eyes

At the end of the day
Let me reach out and touch
All the faces and places and people
That I love so much
Especially the people
That I love so much
Specially the people
That I love so much
