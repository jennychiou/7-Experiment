I heard somebody knocking at the door
And I had a drink in hand
But I was looking for something more
When I put my eyes on you, I fell in love with you

For the last time
I remember the dark brown of your eyes
And your olive skin and the look of sin
Yeah, you took me by surprise

When I put my hands on you
I fell in love with you
For the last time

Because the brighter that we shine
Leaves a bigger shadow in our wake
A story we can tell another time
But if this was love and I was wrong
Then I'll admit the mistakes we made were always mine
Were always mine

I told you to go left, then I went right
Though I told you that I loved you, you couldn't tell I was lying
'Cause I put a spell on you
When I put my eyes on you

For the last time
And maybe I'm too young to settle down (Oh-oh)
'Cause I know that you'd be good for me
But that I wouldn't stick around

And I don't wanna hurt you darling
I don't want to let you down again
For the last time

Because the brighter that we shine
Leaves a bigger shadow in our wake
A story we can tell another time
But if this was love and I was wrong
Then I'll admit the mistakes we made were always mine

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Please don't fly home
Won't you stay?

Because the brighter that we shine
Leaves a bigger shadow in our wake
A story we can tell another time
But if this was love and I was wrong
Then I'll admit the mistakes we made were always mine
Were always mine
