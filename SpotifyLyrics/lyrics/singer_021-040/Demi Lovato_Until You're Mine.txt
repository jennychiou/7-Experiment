My state of mind has finally got the best of me 
I need you next to me 
I'll try to find 
A way that I can get to you 
Just wanna get to you 

The world I see is perfect now 
You're all around 
With you I can breath 

Until you're mine 
I have to find a way to fill this hole inside 
I can't survive without you here by my side 
Until you're mine 
Not gonna be even close to complete 
I won't rest until you're mine, mine 

Alone inside I can only hear your voice 
Ringing through the noise 
I can't find my mind, keeps on coming back to you 
Always back to you 

Wanting something out of reach, it's killing me 
You're all I see, yeah 

Until you're mine 
I have to find a way to fill this hole inside 
I can't survive without you here by my side 
Until you're mine 
Not gonna be even close to complete 
I won't rest until you're mine, mine 

Just stop wondering 
If we were meant to be 
Forget about waiting, just hold me 
I'm ready to begin 
The waiting has to end 
Right now, today 
I've got to find a way, yeah 
Mine 
Until you're mine 

Until you're mine 
I have to find a way to fill this hole inside 
I can't survive without you here by my side 
Until you're mine 
Not gonna be even close to complete 
I won't rest until you're mine 

My state of mind has finally got the best of me 
I need you next to me
