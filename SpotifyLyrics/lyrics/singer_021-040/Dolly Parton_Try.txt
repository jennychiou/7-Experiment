I've chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I have even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountain, soared the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried

I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try

So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be the one to make a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try, you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again

(Try and try and try)
(Try and try and try)

Nothing is impossible if you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one that keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly, and not afraid to try

So try to be the first one up that mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep countin'
And try to soar where only eagles fly
And if you fail at first, just keep on tryin'
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount to much if you don't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
'Cause you'll never really know if you don't try

(Try and try and try)
You gotta to try (Try and try and try)
Come give it a try (Try and try and try)
You have to try (Try)

Oh, I know it ain't easy, whoever said it was?
Life is hard, same as it ever was
But try, you have to try
When you think you can't do it, just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little farther
But try, you have to try
Whatever it is, you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you, I know you can do it
Just try, just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make it
Put on a smile on your face, suck it up and fake it for awhile
At least you know you tried
Don't think I don't suffer, I know what I'm sayin'
When I get to that place, well I start prayin'
And I try, Lord knows I try
I try.
