I don't know why I like him, I just only know I do 
I don't know why I trust him, I just know his heart is true 
I don't know why he's more a man than any man I know 
I don't know how I know the man's for real but I still know 
The man is more than what meets the eye 
He is worn and weary from life 
He is rugged but he's got style 
The man has got what matters inside 

Weary, yes he must get weary but he doesn't say 
But you can read between the lines that wind along his face 
The man has got his memories that he hides inside his mind 
And you can see the sadness in the eyes they hide behind 

The man is more than what meets the eye 
He is worn and weary from life 
He is rugged but he's got style 
The man has got what matters inside 

Love him, yes I've always loved him and I always will 
He holds a place in my heart no one else could ever fill 
He's always been my hero, the best friend I've ever had 
The man is something special and I'm proud that he's my dad 

The man is more than what meets the eye 
He is worn and weary from life 
He is rugged but he's got style 
The man has got what matters inside
