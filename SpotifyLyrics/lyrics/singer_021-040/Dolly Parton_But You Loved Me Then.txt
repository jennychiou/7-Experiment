Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
But you loved me then
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
But you loved me then
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind
And you no longer care but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
