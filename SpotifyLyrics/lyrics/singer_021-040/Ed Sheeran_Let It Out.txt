You give me life
Like lots of oxygen
You treat me like
I was in love again
And I hold you tight
Tight enough to know
That you are mine
I'd never let you go

And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss
So let it out
Let it out, now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

You speak me to me
Behind your darkening stare
And you let me be
As if I wasn't there
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex 
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart
You see we were just like glue

It's you I miss

And it's you I miss
So let it out
Let it out, now
I let it out
I let it out, now, now. 

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn part
You see we were just like glue

We're like glue 

So let it out
Let it out, now
Let it out
Let it out, now, now

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart 
You see we were just like glue
