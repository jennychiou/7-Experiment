I keep a close watch on this heart of mine 
I keep my eyes wide open all the time 
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind 
Because you're mine I walk the line 

I find it very very easy to be true 
I find myself alone when each day's through 
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you 
Because you're mine I walk the line 

As sure as night is dark and day's light 
I keep you on my mind both day and night 
And happiness I've known proves that it's right 
Because you're mine, I walk the line 

You've got a way to keep me on your side 
You give me cause for love that I can't hide 
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide 
Because you're mine, I walk that line 

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine 
I keep my eyes wide open all the time 
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds 
Because you're mine, I walk the line 

Because you're mine, I walk the line 
Because you're mine, I walk the line 

I'm gonna walk it 
I'm gonna walk the line 
I'm gonna walk it, walk it, walk it 
I'm gonna walk that line 

I'm gonna walk it because you're mine 
I'm gonna walk it, walk it 
I'm gonna walk the line 
I'm gonna walk it, walk it 
I'm gonna walk the line 
I'm gonna walk it 
I'm gonna walk the line
