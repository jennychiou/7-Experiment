From the dawning of the world and its wonders 
Before the mountains reached the sky 
From everlasting to everlasting 
You were there through all of time 

All my Fathers heard Your call 
Through the ages 
They made the choice to follow You 
You were faithful 
To the faithful 
They found Your promise to be true 

You have been a shelter, Lord 
To every generation, to every generation 
A sanctuary from the storm 
To every generation, to every generation 

I was born into Your arms, O my father 
There's still a refuge there for me 
From my first breath 
Drawn from Your breath 
You've been my security 

You have been a shelter, Lord 
To every generation, to every generation 
A sanctuary from the storm 
To every generation, to every generation 

My years go by, before Your eyes 
Like days rush into the night 
Time would steal every dream I feel 
Give my hope a place to hide 
All the days of my life 

Let my children know Your mercy in the morning 
And find Your greatness as they grow 
May Your glory be their glory 
May Your heart become their home 

And You will be a shelter, Lord 
To every generation, to every generation 
A sanctuary from the storm 
To every generation, to every generation
