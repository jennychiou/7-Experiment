Knew where I was going when you left the room
You're the kinda guy who makes me wanna follow through to you
I've been trying to leave here for the longest time
The second that I saw you I just knew I found my ride by

I like it, I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it, I like it

I wanna crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
Of something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Something's making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you

I like it, I like it, I like it
And I like it, I like it, I like it

Losing my direction, that's the way it should be
Feeling a connection when you're standing next to me
I wanna be rolling, I just wanna be rolling with you
All of the things you say (I like it, I like it)
They're taking me far away (And I like it)

I wanna crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
Of something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Something's making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you

Maybe you'll save me
You're gonna take me from this crazy
I've been waiting
'Cause I just need a little, I just need a little
Somewhere in the middle with you

Crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
Of something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Something's making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you

Crash, fall, I like it, I like it
Somewhere in the middle with you
Crash, fall, I like it, I like it
Somewhere in the middle with you, middle with you
