The truth is too painful 
This moment too real 
Saying good-bye 
But loving you still 
Too late to start over 
We've tried that before 
And I just don't have it in me 
To try anymore 

But I know I'll miss you 
And I know I'll cry 
I know you loved me 
And I know you've tried 
It's the hardest thing 
I'll ever do in my life 
But I know no good way 
Of saying good-bye 

I know I'll miss you 
And I know I'll cry 
I know you loved me 
And I know I'll ask why 
I know I'll have moments 
When I'll want to die 
But I know no good way 
Of saying good-bye 

And the longest night 
I'll ever spend will be tonight 
'Cause I know no good way of saying
