I saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart
And so I stopped to see what I could do
His heart had been run over by a reckless lover
She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue
Tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride
He was the victim of a love and run
And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him
Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done
Oh this boy has been hurt I'll save him I'll take his heart and mend it if I can
Oh this boy has been hurt I'll save him
I'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them
I'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again
