Find the loneliest girl in a thousand
Find the saddest eyes you've ever seen
Find someone who's always longing for you
Find that man and you found me

And all I need is you all I want is you
To give my loving to all I need is you

Find a man who wakes up every morning
And lives in a world of make believe
Find someone who's arms are aching for you
You find that girl and you found me

And all I need is you all I want is you
To give my loving to all I need is you

You're with me now so let the world forsake us
I've found my heaven here within your arms
And nothing in this world can separate us
You're all I ever wanted all along

And all I need is you all I want is you
To give my loving to all I need is you
