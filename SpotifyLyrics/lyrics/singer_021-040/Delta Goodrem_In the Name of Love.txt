Started on the outside, worked my way in
Tracing the road to where it all begins
Watching myself back, now I find the gutter
I just felt so lost when I wasn't honest
But now

I'm standing on my feet, I'm saying how I feel
Fighting here for everything that's real
And even when it hurts, for all that I am worth
I'm fighting here for everything I feel
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love

They say all is fair in love and war
But nothing ever really is
With best intentions they can leave you torn
But baby that's the way it is
Every choice in life may not be perfect
But in time we'll find it'll be forgotten
Yeah

I'm standing on my feet, I'm saying how I feel
Fighting here for everything that's real
And even when it hurts, for all that I am worth
I'm fighting here for everything I feel
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love

I tell it just the way it is

And here I am just standing on my feet, saying how I feel
Fighting here for everything that's real
And even when it hurts, for all that I am worth
I'm fighting here for everything I feel
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
