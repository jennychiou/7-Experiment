There is a house down in new orleans
Down in the vieux carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun

There is a house
Down in new orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh god, you know I'm one

So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun

There is a house in new orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh god, you know I'm one
Oh god, you know I'm one
