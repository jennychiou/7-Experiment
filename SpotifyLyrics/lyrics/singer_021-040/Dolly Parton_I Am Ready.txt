I am ready 
Oh, my children 
When Jesus knocks at my door 
I'll be there come morning 
Don't weep for me 
I'll be with my Lord 
There's my bible on the table 
Read it to me once more 
I can hear God's heavenly angels 
Singing me on through heaven's door 

Hallelujah Lord 
I am ready 
No more sorrow 
Hallelujah, yes 
I am ready, I am ready 
I am ready to go 

Oh, Hosanna 
Take my hand now 
Lead me to the promised land now 
I am ready, I am ready 
Hallelujah, I am ready to go 
Oh, Hosanna 
I am ready to go 
I can hear God's heavenly angels 
Singing me on through heaven's door 
Singing me on through heaven's door 
And I am ready
