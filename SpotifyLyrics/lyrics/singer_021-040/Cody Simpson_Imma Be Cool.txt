When I wake up in the morning happy
I got a lot of people talking at me
As if in my shoes, they'd walk every mile, yeah

So I deal with negativity all day
But I ain't gon' let it rub me the wrong way
To each his own, and I walk away with a smile

'Cause until I share my life with someone else
Imma find my good times by myself
And you'll never see me sad about it, no

Singin'
Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be cool
Oh Imma be all right
Na na na Imma be
Na na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be cool
Don't worry 'bout me

Ooh ooh oh

As you can see I ain't a stressed out person
I don't really think the time is worth it
I'd rather spend it with a girl and my guitar
(And it sounds something like)

But I ain't really found a girl that gets me
But that don't mean I walk around feelin' empty
It only means I gotta be patient for a while
And that's all right

'Cause until I share my life with someone else
Imma find my good times by myself
And you'll never see me sad about it, no no

Singin'
Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be cool
Oh Imma be all right
Na na na Imma be
Na na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be cool
Don't worry 'bout me


(I feel you Cody, we just chillin', we just chillin')
Nah brotha it's nothing, I'm not buggin'
I wake up in the morning and enjoy an English muffin
Little fried egg with a side of turkey bake
And I'm dancing round the kitchen listenin' to T-Pain
I understand things won't always go my way
Instead of tryin' to force it I just try and ride the wave
Go in, around, and up, and down, and never look away
Stay focused on that level ground and things will turn out straight
Yeah my intuition's fabulous, instincts are simply great
And my homies keep me grounded, never worried 'bout the hate
If you hear them talkin' bad, then this is what you do
Look 'em in the face and say I'll be cool
Tell 'em Cody, bruh

Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be cool
Oh Imma be all right
Na na na Imma be
Na na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be cool
Don't worry 'bout me

Ooh ooh oh
(Don't worry 'bout me, Imma be cool)
