Oh, woah, oh

I don't know why, I don't know why I'm so afraid
And I don't know how, I don't know how to fix the pain
We're livin' a lie, livin' a lie this needs to change
We're out of time, we're out of time and it's still the same

We can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
But I'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone

I'm hearing the noise, hearing the noise from all around
And I'm on the edge, I'm on the edge of breakin' down
Like Bonnie and Clyde, let's find a ride and ditch this town
To keep it alive, keep it alive, don't make a sound

We can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
But I'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone

I never wanna take that final look
I'll turn another page, won't close the book

We can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
But I'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone

Let us be alone, let us be alone
