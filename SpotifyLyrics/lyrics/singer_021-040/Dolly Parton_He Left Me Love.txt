He left me love enough to last a lifetime a lifetime filled with loving memories
And so I have no reason to search for new love time could never take his love
From me
And my mind is filled with mem'ries sweet and tender
My heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes the love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
I just close my eyes and I still see him
And in dreams he loves me just like he used to do
Even wakes me with a tender kiss every morning
A kiss that lingers on my lips the whole day through
And my mind is filled...
Oh yes he left me love
