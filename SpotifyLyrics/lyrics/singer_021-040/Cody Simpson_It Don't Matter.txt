Woah baby, woah baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everyday people like you
And me just wanna live naturally
Times are true and you told me
"Nothing gonna get us down, can't you see?"

I said if it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me, oh baby
If it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me, woah baby

People all around making sounds and all kinds of noise
If I could only get there, then I could enjoy
Who they tryna be? Who they tryna fool, let's change the mood right now
Turn down the lights, it's time to cool it down

If it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me, woah no no no
If it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me, woah baby

Yesterday, what we could be? It don't matter
Getting more of what we don't need, it don't matter
Everyday I'm less of you
It doesn't matter to me
No, woah
Bring it on down, bring it on down to me
Sing it all down, sing it all down to me
Bring it on down, bring it on down to me

If it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me, woah no no no
If it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me
I say if it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me, oh no no no
If it don't matter to you, it don't matter to me, no no no no don't matter
