You've seen me naked in more ways than one
You've seen me done up, seen me come undone
We've cried in the darkness, we've laughed in the sun
We've been forever, yet we've just begun

We've come full circle, all the way 'round
Though the good times, the bad times, through life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together
Through thick and through thin
Yes, we've come full circle.
Thank God, we're still friends

You know the soft spots under my skin
Deep down inside me, where no one has been
And we've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the wind
But time's only sweetened this love that we're in

We've come full circle, all the way 'round
Though the good times, the bad times, through life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together
Through thick and through thin
Yes, we've come full circle.
Thank God, we're still friends

We've cried in the darkness, laughed in the sun
We've come full circle and we've just begun
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
You know we've cried in the darkness, and we've laughed in the sun
We've stayed together, and we've just begun

We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
I'm so glad you're still my friend
We've come full circle, and I'd do it again
