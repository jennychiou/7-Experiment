Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you 
But I can't ever seem to count that far 
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons 
More than this I love you as you are 
More than this I love you as you are 

You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing 
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything 
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star 
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are 
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are 

You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep 
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak 
Every role I play in life you play the leading part 
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are 
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are 

You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing 
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything 
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star 
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are 
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are
