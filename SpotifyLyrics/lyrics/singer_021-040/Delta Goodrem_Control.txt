I woke up in our bed, but you weren't there
Some dreams start out as dreams and turn into nightmares
I, been screaming your name, but it's always the same
And I can't shut my mouth and hope you'll love me

I, I've been at this too long, when I know that it's wrong to be here
Tonight, I'm just letting you know,
I'm taking back control
Watch as I leave, ache to your soul
Baby, I'm taking back control

Control

You had every chance to make it right
You know I've loved you more than anyone else in life
I'm, not yours anymore, I'll pick up my tears off the floor
Cause baby, you had my heart and I'm taking it back


I, I've been at this too long, when I know that it's wrong to be here
Tonight, I'm just letting you know,
I'm taking back control
Watch as I leave, ache to your soul
Baby, I'm taking back control

(Do you remember the sound of your freedoom)
Control
(Marching on in here to my life's beating drum
Do you remember the sound of me leavin')
May I reming you... Who I was before you...

I, I've been at this too long, when I know that it's wrong to be here
Tonight, I'm just letting you know,
I'm taking back, I'm taking it back, taking it back, I'm taking it back
Taking it back, taking it back, I'm taking it back
Tonight, I'm just letting you know
I'm taking back control
Watch as I leave, ache to your soul
Baby, I'm taking back control

Control

Baby, I'm taking back control
Control

Baby, I'm taking back control
