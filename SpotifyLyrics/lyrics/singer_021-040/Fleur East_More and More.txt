They say love can't lift you up no more
But boy you lift me like a ninja core
They say love's gonna get in you misery
But baby that don't sound like you and me
When you're touching me, my heart it comes alive
(All night, all night)
And you're the only one, 'cause boy you do me right
(All night, all night)

Shut up and let me say it
We don't need to complicate it
I just wanna be your baby
Every day I love you more and more
Look at what we started
Nobody ??? party
Everything I want, you got it
Every day I love you more and more
Oh, you know you know you know I love you more and more
More and more, baby
Oh, you know you know you know I love you more and more
More and more, baby

Let's go!
Thought my whole life was out of key
Now my heart it hears a symphony
Though I tried, I couldn't find my favorite song
But I just wanna play you all night long
When you're touching me, my heart it comes alive
(All night, all night)
And you're the only one, 'cause boy you do me right
(All night, all night)

Come on! Shut up and let me say it
We don't need to complicate it
I just wanna be your baby
Every day I love you more and more
Look at what we started
Nobody ??? party
Everything I want, you got it
Every day I love you more and more!
Oh, you know you know you know I love you more and more,
More and more, baby
Oh, you know you know you know I love you more and more,
More and more, baby

You're going straight to my head
(Can't stop, boy, I can't stop)
Boy, all I want, boy you got it
(Can't get it, I can't get enough)
Baby!

Shut up and let me say it
We don't need to complicate it
I just wanna be your baby
Every day I love you more and more
Look at what we started
Nobody ??? party
Everything I want, you got it
Every day I love you more and more!
Oh, you know you know you know I love you more and more,
More and more, baby
Oh, you know you know you know I love you more and more,
More and more, baby

I'm in love, it's alright
You take me up so high
And I love it,
Every day I love you more and more
I'm in love, it's alright
You take me up so high
And I love it,
Every day I love you more and more
I'm in love, it's alright
You take me up so high
And I love it,
Every day I love you more and more
