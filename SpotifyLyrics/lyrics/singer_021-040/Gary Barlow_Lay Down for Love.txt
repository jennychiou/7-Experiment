Hey,
Hoh,
He-e-e-ey,
Lay down for love,
Lay down,
Yeah,

I was alone,
With you on my mind,
Look at me now,
You've left me behind,
You're all that matters,
You are my life,
You are the one that should be here by my side,

(You are my lover)
Yes you are,
You should be my friend,
Don't you think we've got some talkin' to do?
Only love depends on you,

Don't tell me it's over,
'Cause it's not over yet, no,
Don't tell me you love me when you're tryin' 'a throw this love away,
Don't throw this love away,
Don't say that I changed girl,
Because change is not enough, no,
Don't tell me it's over,
When you know that we can fight,
You know, you gotta lay down for love,
You gotta lay down for love,
Oh yeah,

So where is your kiss?
Where is your touch?
The taste of your lips,
I miss them so much,
You said you'd be back soon,
You said you'd be here,
You seem to run every time love comes near,

(Remember when we were lovers?)
Yes I do,
Remember when we were friends, ooh ooh?
Don't you think we've got some talkin' to do?
In the end it's up to you,
(I got to talk to you!)

Don't tell me it's over,
'Cause it's not over yet, no,
Don't tell me you love me when you're tryin' 'a throw this love away,
Don't throw this love away,
Don't say that I changed girl,
Because change is not enough, no,
Don't tell me it's over when you know that we can fight it,
You know, you gotta lay down for love,

(Lay down, lay down)
Lay down for me, lay down for you,
Lay down for everything you do,
'Cause you know it's right,
You know it's time,
To love me for the rest of your life,
(Love me for the rest of your life)
(Even when you got good love you don't need it)
When you got good love,
(Even when you got good love it ain't right)
It ain't right,
(All you gotta do is love me..)
To please me, oh oh oh,

Whoo ooh ooh whoo ooh ooh whoo ooh ooh ooh,
Yeah yeah,
Ooh no no...
(Fade out)
