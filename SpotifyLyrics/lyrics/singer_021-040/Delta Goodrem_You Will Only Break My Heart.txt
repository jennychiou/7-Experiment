Tell me your thoughts now baby
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's eating you alive
Tell me your darkest secrets
Clear up those stupid lies
Show me what's there behind those eyes

I wanna know 'cause I can't face another day here in the dark
I'm tired of wondering when we're together baby where you are
Why should I give you everything when you will only break my heart?

You will only break my heart

Tell me your thoughts now baby
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's eating you alive
Tell me your latest story
What will it be this time
Show me what's there behind those eyes

I wanna know why you can't find a way to just let down your guard
I don't believe that love or what we had should ever be this hard
Why should I give you everything when you will only break my heart?

You will only break my heart

All this is too familiar
I think we've been here before
I wish I could believe you
I see you down on your knees

You will only break my heart
