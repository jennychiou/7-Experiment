I thought I'd been in love before but so did you
I thought that I would love no more but so did you
We'll always be together, forever yours forever mine
You and me, you and me are two of a kind

There's so much between you and me
Like sadness and disappointments, jealousy
Like respect and honor and admiration and a love so fine
You and me, you and me are two of a kind

I'd made promises to you that I couldn't keep
And you know I've said things to you that I didn't mean
We made our vows and we can never break the ties that bind
You and me, you and me are two of a kind

There's so much between you and me
Like sadness and disappointments, jealousy
Like respect and honor and admiration and a love so fine
You and me, you and me are two of a kind
