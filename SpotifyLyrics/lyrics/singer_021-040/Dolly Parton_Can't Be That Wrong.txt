So often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again

'Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end

"Torn Between Two Lovers" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong

I guess I should be singing "Rock of Ages"
"Amazing Grace", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong

Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again

And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right

And "Torn Between Two Lovers" just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home

I guess I should be singing "Rock of Ages"
"Amazing Grace", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
'Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong

To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't be
