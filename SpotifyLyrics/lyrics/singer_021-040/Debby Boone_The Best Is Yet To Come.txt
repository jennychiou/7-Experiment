Out of the tree of life 
I just picked me a plum 
You came along 
And everything's starting to hum 
Still it's a real good bet 
The best is yet to come 

The best is yet to come 
And babe, won't it be fine? 
You think you've seen the sun 
But you ain't seen it shine 

Wait till the warmup's underway 
Wait till our lips have met 
Wait till you see that sunshine day 
You ain't seen nothing yet 

The best is yet to come 
And babe, won't it be fine? 
The best is yet to come 
Come the day you're mine 

The best is yet to come 
Come the day you're mine 

Come the day you're mine 
I'm gonna teach you to fly 
Yeah, we've only tasted the wine 
We're gonna drain the cup dry 
Wait till your charms are right 
For these arms to surround 
You think you've flown before 
You ain't left the ground 
Wait till you're locked in my embrace 
Wait till I draw you near 
Wait till you see that sunshine place 
Ain't nothing like it here 

The best is yet to come 
And babe, won't it be fine? 
The best is yet to come 
Come the day you're mine 
The best is yet to come 
Come the day you're mine 
The best is yet to come 
Come the day you're mine 
You're mine
