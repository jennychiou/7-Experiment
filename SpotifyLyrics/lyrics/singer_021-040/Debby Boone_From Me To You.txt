If there's anything that you want 
If there's anything I can do 
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

I got everything that you want
Like a heart that's, oh, so true
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do 
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do 
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

To you
To you
From me to you
From me to you
From me to you
