There's an "S" under my clothes
On my chest where nobody else can see
I light up when the doors are closed
I am free, yeah
And I wish I could make my move
I can tell that you're really into me
And I don't got a thing to lose
In my dreams, in my dreams

I'm a badass jumping off a moving train
I'm a Jane Bond putting all them guys to shame
I'm a wildcard and I'm gonna steal your game
You better watch out

I'm a fire starter
Make your blood run faster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter (yeah yeah)
I'm a sweet disaster (yeah yeah)
I melt hearts like water (yeah yeah)
Oh, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, yeah

I might look all innocent
But the embers are burning inside of me
And I'm ready to take that step
Can't you see, can't you see

I'm a badass jumping off a moving train
I'm a Jane Bond putting all them guys to shame
I'm a wild card I'm about to take my aim
You better watch out

I'm a fire starter (yeah yeah)
I'm a sweet disaster (yeah yeah)
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter (yeah yeah)
I'm a sweet disaster (yeah yeah)
I melt hearts like water (yeah yeah)
Oh, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

Up so high I'm burning up
Kiss your lips I'm waking up
There's nothing more to be afraid of

There's an "S" under my clothes
On my chest where nobody else can see

I'm a fire starter (yeah yeah)
Make your blood run faster (yeah yeah)
I melt hearts like water (Water)
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter (yeah yeah)
I'm a sweet disaster (yeah yeah)
I melt hearts like water (yeah yeah)
Oh, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter
