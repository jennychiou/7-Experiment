Hey - Aim your gun and pull the trigger
I'm up and running like a river, yeah I'm already gone
Just - When you think you know who I am
If you think I'm gonna keep on crying
Yeah, I'm already done
I smile when it's the hardest time to smile
I climb when it's the highest mountain to climb

Baby, Baby, when my sun goes down
That's when my stars come out
Baby, Baby, when my sun goes down
That's when my stars come out to shine...
Shine...

Hey - Should I let you go on lying
What's the point of me denying when I've already won
Hey - Maybe you should try to remember
You're never gonna make me surrender 'cause I've already won
I smile when it's the hardest time to smile
I climb when it's the highest mountain to climb

Baby, Baby, when my sun goes down
That's when my stars come out
Baby, Baby, when my sun goes down
That's when my stars come out to shine...
Shine...

The sun sets, but it ain't over yet
The sun sets, but it ain't over yet
The sun sets, but it ain't over yet
The sun sets...

Baby, Baby, when the sun goes down
That's when my stars come out
Baby, Baby, when my sun goes down
That's when my stars come out to shine
Shine
That's when my stars come out to shine
Shine
Shine

When my sun goes down
That's when my stars come out
