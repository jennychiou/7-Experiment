Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart 
Never have I had this beautiful feeling before 
Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart 
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore 

It wasn't too long ago 
I thought I would never know 
What reason has anyone to sing a happy song 

I knew only loneliness 
But then I found happiness 
And now I just want to the world to smile and sing along 

'Cause your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart 
Never have I heard this beautiful music before 
Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart 
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore 

Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart 
Never have I heard this beautiful music before 
Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart 
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore
