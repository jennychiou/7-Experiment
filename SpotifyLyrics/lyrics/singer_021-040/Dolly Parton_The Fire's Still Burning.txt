Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long
Each night without you just gets longer
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning

Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time
I know I never will stop...
Yes baby the fire's still burning
