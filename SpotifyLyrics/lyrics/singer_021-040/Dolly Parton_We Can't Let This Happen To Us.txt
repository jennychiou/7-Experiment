Lately we're acting as if we were strangers
For a moment with each other we don't take time
With our work and busy schedules of things we think important
Seems we've left the most important things behind

And we can't let this happen to us
The hills that we climb may seem rough
And the mountains between could shadow our dreams
And we can't let this happen to us

We can't let this happen to us
We must cherish each smile and tender touch
For the castles we've built could all crumble to dust
And we can't let this happen to us
No we can't let this happen to us
