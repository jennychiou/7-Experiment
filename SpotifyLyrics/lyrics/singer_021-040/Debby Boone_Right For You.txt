You're just like me 
You've got times of doubt and insecurity 
To some degree 
You've got chains that hold you and you long to be free 
You want to rise above your limitations 
You want to live your life without frustration 
Oh, can't you see 
We're alike, you and me 

I'm just like you 
I face difficult times and hard decisions, too 
It's sad but true 
I don't always do the things I know I should do 
But I've found someone to help me daily 
To lift me out of my human frailty 
He carries me through 
He can carry you, too 

Right for you 
He's right for you 
Jesus is all that I need 
I know that He's what you need, too 
Right for you 
In every part of your life 
I know that He is right for you 

You're just like me 
You know that life doesn't come with a guarantee 
And all you see 
Are people searching hard for quick remedy 
Longing for a rock of reassurance 
Against the odds of our low endurance 
Oh, can't you see 
We're alike, you and me 

Right for you 
He's right for you 
Jesus is all that I need 
I know that He's what you need, too 
Right for you 
In every part of your life 
I know that He is right for you
