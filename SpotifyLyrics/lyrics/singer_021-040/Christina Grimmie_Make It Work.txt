Do you wanna tell me
What you have against me
And why, you keep me in disgust
What are you afraid of
'Cause it can't be that bad
Being friends, beneficial ties

For a couple of days
I've gotten looks from your lady
Now you tell me how she knows
I've got my eyes on you
And it's funny how your girl
Just seems to ignore me
Anytime we're stuck together
In the same small room

Baby, doesn't have to be you and her
Maybe we can make it work
Maybe we can make it work
And baby, don't you know I wanna rock your world
And I don't care about the other girl
You know I've never been scared of her
We can make it work

She's a bit of a looker
But you could do better
You're worth it
I can make you see
She doesn't care
The way I care
Don't you know
You're better off with me

But if we can't be real
And you really do feel that baby she's the one
I can let it go we can keep it down low
And if she asks it was just good fun
Boy you say it's not the way you think it should go
And you miss me far too much
Well, Make up your mind
'Cause you're wasting my time
But I'm still not giving up

Baby, doesn't have to be you and her
Maybe we can make it work
Maybe we can make it work
And baby, don't you know I wanna rock your world
And I don't care about the other girl
You know I've never been scared of her
We can make it work

It's too bad
'Cause I don't know now
The way I feel about you
And then you do what you do

Baby, doesn't have to be you and her
Maybe we can make it work
Maybe we can make it work
And baby, don't you know I wanna rock your world
And I don't care about the other girl
You know I've never been scared of her

Baby, doesn't have to be you and her
Maybe we can make it work
Maybe we can make it work
Maybe we can make it work
And baby, don't you know I wanna rock your world
And I don't care about the other girl
You know I've never been scared of her
We can make it work
