If you ever need to cry
I'll wipe the tears right from your eyes
Oh yes, I will
If you can't fall asleep at night
I'll sing to you a lullaby
Oh yes, I will

Can I be your gentleman?
I'll be as gentle as I can
Girl, what will it take?
To be your gentleman
To be your gentleman
I swear I'll be the luckiest man
If I can be your gentleman

I wanna be the one you hug
When the world is just too much
Oh what you say?
I wanna be the one you trust (trust)
I'll keep your secrets between us
Oh what you say?

Can I be your gentleman?
I'll be as gentle as I can
Girl, what what would it take?
To be your gentleman
I swear I'll be the luckiest man
If I could be your gentleman

Yeah, I will open every door for you
'Cause my lady should be first, awh yeah
I'll throw my jacket over a puddle
'Cause my lady should be first, ooh yeah
So tell me baby possibly
That you might consider me?
Just say you will
And I love you humbly
I just pray that you believe
That I could be your gentleman
