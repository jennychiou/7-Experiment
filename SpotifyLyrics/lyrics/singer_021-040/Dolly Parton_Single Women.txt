Single bars and single women
With a single thought in mind
Just to make it till the morning
Looking for what they can find
For a man they won't remember
For a night they can't forget
Do you come to this place often?
May I light your cigarette?
Drinkin' beer in Amarillo
Passing time and swaping jokes
Hoping for a new beginning
But beginning to lose hope
And you're waiting for that moment
When a glance becomes a stare
Mmm, what's that perfume that you're wearing?
Haven't I met you somewhere?

Find a matchbook in the morning
With a name and number scrawled
When you phone, a woman answers
And you wish you'd never called
Oh, they're friendly when they meet you
But they're strangers when they go
Ah, do you mind if I come join you?
Would you like to dance one more?

And it's gettin' near to closing
And the seconds pass like years
Lots of friends to share the laughter
Not a one to share the tears

Oh and you wish they'd change that juke box
Cause you know every song it plays
Can I drop you off at my place?
Oh, what's the matter, are you gay?
You gotta twenty in your pocket
Got your toothbrush in your purse
Life could get a whole lot better
But it better not get worse
