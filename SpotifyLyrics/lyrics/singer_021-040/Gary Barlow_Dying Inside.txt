How can I make sure no one notices me
Don't want a conversation with nobody
And it hurts too much to say how I feel
What you don't know, is all I know

How can I make sure that I fool everyone
Gonna wear a suit and tie
And put my bravest face on
And it's far to deep to show you this wound
No it won't heal no time soon
Nobody knows what I'm going through

I'm dying inside
Who knows what I'm thinking
What I'm trying to hide
Yeah, I'm dying all night
I'm breathing but I can't feel life
I'm smiling but I'm dying inside

How can I make sure
I'm invisible
I find just a simple phrase that may say it all
'Cause it's far too soon and not the right time
What I've seen was for my eyes

And how can I make sure
No one worries for me
'Cause I don't need a helping hand
And don't want sympathy
Don't know what I need but know what I don't
What you can't see it feels so broke
That you can't see is how I'll cope

'Cause I'm dying inside
Who knows what I'm thinking
What I'm trying to hide
Yeah, I'm dying all night
I'm breathing but I can't feel life
I'm smiling but I'm dying inside

Want everyone around to think that I'm alright
Hope they assume I've left the dark and found the light
Want them to think that I don't cry myself to sleep at night

Yeah, I'm dying inside
Who knows what I'm thinking
What I'm trying to hide
Yeah, I'm dying all night
I'm breathing but I can't feel life
I'm smiling but I'm dying inside
