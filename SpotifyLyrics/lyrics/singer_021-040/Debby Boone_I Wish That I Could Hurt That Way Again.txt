Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
In between the sorrow
At least there was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow there's no end
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again

Oh I wish that we could play that game again
Even though I'd always loose and you would win
At times you would desert me
The emptiness would hurt me
But you coming back was always worth the pain
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again

I'd love to hear you tell me you don't need me anymore
Just like you used to tell me everyday
I loved to watch you leaving like a hundred times before
At least my eyes could see you walking in

Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
In between the sorrow
At least there was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow there's no end
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
