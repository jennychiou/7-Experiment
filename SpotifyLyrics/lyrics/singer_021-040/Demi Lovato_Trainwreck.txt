La dee da, yeah

You fled from medication 
'Cause it only causes pain
You won't go to the doctor
He keeps calling you insane

You're lost even when
You're going the right way
You mean the world to me
Even though you might be crazy

And you said we wouldn't make it
But look how far we've come
For so long my heart was breaking
But now it's standing strong
The things you'd say
Made me fall harder each day
You're a trainwreck
But I wouldn't love you if you changed

No, yeah

I shook your hand
And you pulled it right away, yeah
You asked me to dance
And instead I said no way

Inside I was dying to give it a try
And you begged me so I stayed
I knew you were different
From the way I caved

And you said we wouldn't make it
But look how far we've come
For so long my heart was breaking
But now it's standing strong
The things you'd say
You make me fall harder each day
You're a trainwreck
But I wouldn't love you if you changed

Yeah, ooh, no, yeah

We were so different
But opposites attract
So my hope kept growing
And I never looked back
You're one of a kind
No one can change this heart of mine

And you said we wouldn't make it
But look how far we've come
For so long my heart was breaking
And now it's standing strong
The things you'd say
You make me fall harder each day
You're a trainwreck
But I wouldn't love you if you changed

Oh, ooh, ooh, yeah

One more thing I thought
I'd share with someone special
I'm falling like I've never felt before
It's funny, you said we'd never make it
And look how far we've come
You're a trainwreck but with you
I'm in love
