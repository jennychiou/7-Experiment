I can't fall asleep tonight,
I'm not the same without you.
Since I've been gone,
Since I've been gone.

When I lay down at night,
Nobody's here to catch,
The tears I cry
Can't wait to be home,
Wait to be home.

A million more miles,
Till I get to see you,
A thousand more minutes,
I know I'll have to go through.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, back to you.

A hundred more thoughts,
Of us to consume me.
Too many steps till,
You're right in front of me.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, back to you.

I keep good company,
But most days I'm still lonely,
Without you here,
Without you here.

I try to do my thing,
But I just might go insane,
Without you near,
Without you near.

A million more miles,
Till I get to see you,
A thousand more minutes,
I know I'll have to go through.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, back to you.

A hundred more thoughts,
Of us to consume me.
Too many steps till,
You're right in front of me.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, back to you.

If you could travel the world,
With me I'd feel so complete,
We'd have the time of our lives.

Right now, I keep waiting,
A little longer, to be,
By your side, oh yeah, babe.

A million more miles,
Till I get to see you,
A thousand more minutes,
I know I'll have to go through.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, back to you.

A hundred more thoughts,
Of us to consume me.
Too many steps till,
You're right in front of me.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, back to you.

A million more miles,
Till I get to see you,
A thousand more minutes,
I know I'll have to go through.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, back to you.

A hundred more thoughts,
Of us to consume me.
Too many steps till,
You're right in front of me.

Counting my, (counting my),
Way back to you, way back to you, oh.
