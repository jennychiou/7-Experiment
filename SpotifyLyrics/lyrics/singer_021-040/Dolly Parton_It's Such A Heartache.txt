Each time I dial your number I never get an answer
It seems like you're avoiding me
I can't take unhappy endings so I just keep pretending
You'll see the light eventually

Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you

Feels like some tragic movie please say you'll come back to me
Dreamin' of you night after night
I'm havin' trouble sleepin'
Your memory is keepin' these feelings runnin' through my mind

Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you

It's such a heartache, I don't know what to do
It's such a heartache and it's tearin' me in two
You took away the dream I wanted more than anything

Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you

Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you
