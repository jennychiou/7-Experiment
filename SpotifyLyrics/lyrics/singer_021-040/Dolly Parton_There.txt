There is a place where the sun's always glowing 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
Meadows grow green near the streams gently flowing 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
A city of riches beyond comprehension 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
Streets are of gold, gates of pearl, brilliant mansions 
Take me there, won't you take me there 

Take me and show me this rare place you speak of 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
To this land of plenty where there is complete love 
Take me there, won't you take me there 

At the foot of the throne the kingdom rejoices 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
The angels are singing His praise with their voices 
Hallelujah, hallelujah take me there 

Peace, joy and love linger on through the ages 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
Lambs lay with lions and lions with babies 
Take me there, won't you take me there 

Take me and show me this rare place you speak of 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
To this land of plenty where there is complete love 
Take me there, I can't take you there 

But there is a church where they teach all about it 
Take me there, won't you take me there 
There is a book we must not be without it 
Take me there, I will read with you there 

There is an altar where sins are forgiven 
Take me there, yes I'll kneel with you there 
We'll find there the God of Eternal Living 
Take me there, He will take you there 

There is no sorrow and no heartache there 
There is no crying and no dying there 
Won't you take me there, won't you take me there 
Hallelujah won't you take me there
