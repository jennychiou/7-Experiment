It's been a long dark night 
And I've been a waitin' for the morning 
It's been a long hard fight 
But I see a brand new day a dawning 
I've been looking for the sunshine 
'Cause I ain't seen it in so long 
But everything's gonna work out just fine 
Everything's gonna be all right 
That's been all wrong 

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of a brand new day 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
And everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

It's been a long long time 
Since I've known the taste of freedom 
And those clinging vines 
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em 

'Cause I am strong and I can prove it 
And I got my dreams to see me through 
It's just a mountain, I can move it 
And with faith enough there's nothing I can't do 

And I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
And I can see the light of brand new day 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
And everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of a brand new day 
Yes I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
And everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
Yes I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
Everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

I can see the light 
I can see the light 

It's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be all right
