Ooh, but love was just so hard to find
Till you came along into my life
And then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine

And ever since that day I've been hooked
Nothing can turn me away
This living with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday

Ooh, I'm reaching the highest of highs
Everytime I look into your eyes
You ask how I feel
I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside

And I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you want me baby
And for your love I would do anything
Every night I'm a fool for your love

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and can't get enough

Driving home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights, well I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you

I waited all day by the telephone
Staring at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and can't get enough

Ooh, you're giving me chills up my spine
I'm feeling so fine, going out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I love you right up until I drop, you know

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and can't get enough

'Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool and can't get enough

'Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
