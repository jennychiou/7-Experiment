When you feel the pain of loneliness inside you you feel the emptiness that lives within
When all the things around you had no meaning
And the lips you love can kiss you once and then
That's when love (love) will mean the most that's when love (love) will hold you close
To the lips you love to touch and the things that mean so much
That's when love (that's when love) will mean the most

When you see a gentle smile from one that loves you
I feel a softness in the touch of love's sweet hand
Or just reminiscing back through childhood mem'ries
Of days gone by that can't return again
That's when love...
