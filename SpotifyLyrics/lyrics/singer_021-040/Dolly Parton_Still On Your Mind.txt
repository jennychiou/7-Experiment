Darling you know, you know I love you like I love no other
And you told me, remember when you told me, you'd forget her in time
Time passes by but still you can't forget her, it looks like you can't forget her
Oh and that makes me wonder if you'll ever, ever be mine

There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
While there's another, another still on your mind
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not when there's another, another still on your mind
There's just no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not while there's another, another still on your mind, still on your mind
