Saw you turnin' down main street in your big, black fancy car 
You were dressed up fit to kill, with a pretty girl on your arm 
You spun around and you headed up town 
Where the neon lights all shine 
Left me choking in a cloud of dust 
You never pay me no mind 

You're livin' in the fast lane 
I guess I'm just too slow 
I never wore silk or fancy furs 
Just plain ole calico 

I'll never be a fast lane lover 
And they're the only kind you take up town 
I am just a country road 
That you keep turnin' down 

If you ever hit a dead end street 
If it's love that you're looking for 
You can always turn around 
And beat a path right to my door 
Do I have to draw you a map 
You seem to know your way around 
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels 
Baby, we can go to town 

You're livin' in the fast lane 
I guess I'm just too slow 
I never wore silk or fancy furs 
Just plain ole calico 

I'll never be a fast lane lover 
And they're the only kind you take up town 
I am just a country road 
That you keep turnin' down 

I am just a country road 
That you keep turnin' down 

You're livin' in the fast lane 
I guess I'm just too slow 
I never wore silk or fancy furs 
Just plain ole calico
