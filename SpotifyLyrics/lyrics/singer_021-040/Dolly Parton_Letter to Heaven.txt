An old man was sitting at his table one day 
Writing a letter to pass time away 
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee 
Saying won't you please write a letter for me 
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away 
I coming to see her real soon I hope 
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat 

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope 
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail 
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale 

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast 
The little girls prayers had been answered at last 

The postman was passing and picked up the note 
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke 
Straight up into heaven this letter did go 
She's happy up there with her mommy I know
