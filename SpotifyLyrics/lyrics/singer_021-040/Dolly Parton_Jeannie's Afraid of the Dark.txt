Her two little feet would come running into
Our bedroom almost every night
Her soft little face would be wet from her tears
And her little heart pounding with fright
She'd hold out her arms, then she'd climb in beside us
In her small voice, we'd hear her remark

"Mommie and Daddy, can I sleep here with you
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark"
One day in the summer, we took some flowers
To place on some old family graves
Jeannie said, "Mommy, ain't it dark in the ground
Oh, Daddy, I'd be so afraid"
Then she looked up at her daddy and me
And said somethin' that broke both our hearts
She said, "When I die, please don't bury me
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark"

Jeannie was always afraid of the dark
And we never could understand why
'Cause we looked after Jeannie with the very best of care
Because Jeannie was our only child
Perhaps it was death that she was so afraid of
'Cause it took her one dark stormy night
I think we always knew that we'd never see Jeannie grown
'Cause it seemed she was destined to die
But on Jeannie's grave, we placed an eternal flame
That glows and never loses its spark
And on the darkest night, there's always a light
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark

Our Jeannie's afraid of the dark
