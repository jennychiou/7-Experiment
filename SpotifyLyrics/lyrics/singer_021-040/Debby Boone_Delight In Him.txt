When the level of every fear is rising 
Let your praise rise up higher till 
You delight in Him 
Delight in Him 
When discouragement has you at the bottom 
Let your love go down deeper still 
And delight in Him 
Delight in Him 
It doesn't matter what appears to be 
His overriding power is all you need to see 

When the dreams of your heart become elusive 
Make Him your goal and tell Him how 
You delight in Him 
Delight in Him 
When the measure of hope adds up to nothing 
Count it all joy and tell Him now 
You delight in Him 
Delight in Him 
It doesn't matter what appears to be 
He'll show you all that matters for eternity 
If you delight in Him 

Lift up your voice to Heaven 
Like a trumpet's sound 
And delight in Him 

It doesn't matter if you're running dry 
There's a source of living water that will never die 
If you will delight in Him 

Lift up your voice to Heaven 
Like a trumpet's sound 
And delight in Him 

It doesn't matter what appears to be 
His overriding power is all we need to see 
So let us delight in Him 

Lift up your voice to Heaven 
Like a trumpet's sound 
And delight in Him 
Let's delight in Him 
Delight in Him
