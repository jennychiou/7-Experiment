At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone

Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

And I wonder if he's sorry
For leaving what we begun
Guess there's someone for me somewhere
Aw, but I still miss somone
