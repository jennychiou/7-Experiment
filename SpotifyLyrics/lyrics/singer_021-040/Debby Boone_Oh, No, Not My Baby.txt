When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true.
I showed them all I had a faith in you.
I just kept on sayin'

Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies (Tell you lies)

My mama told me when rumors spread 
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But didn't listen to what she said
I kept right on sayin'

Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys

Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh no, not my sweet baby.

Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
