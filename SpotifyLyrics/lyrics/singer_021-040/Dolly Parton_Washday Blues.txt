Last Saturday night I looked like a princess dressed in calico
Now blue Monday washday I look like a lady hobo
Just rubbin' and a scrubbin' and a raisin' 'em out
I gotta hang 'em out early I hope the sun comes out
(Wash 'em out ring 'em out hang 'em on the line
Get a little tired just think about the good times) washday blues

Now I ain't never been very lucky I ain't never won a prize
But I'd like to get a job on TV for some of that soap they advertise
Rubbin' and scrubbin...

Well that good lookin' good lovin' no good man of mine
Could buy me a washin' machine
But he spends all his money on payday to make me look like a queen
Now rubbin' and scrubbin'...
