When you walked into my life
With your muddy shoes on and your baggage
Claim ticket one night...
I thought it'd be okay 'cause there was
Something about you
That made me feel somehow safe
I gave too much to you, you took it all away and
Finally I had no more to give...
So don't try to come back and break me down
I am standing so much stronger now

I have lost my love
I have lost my love, I have lost my love for you
Every little bit, every part of it
There is nothing more to do
Oh I have lost my faith
I have lost my faith, in everything you said was true
When the dust has settled down
I realised I lost all love for you...

I lost my belief in your tired excuses
And the reasons why you weren't there
I cried myself to sleep but now I'm back on my feet...
I don't need anything more from you
So go and live your life find another wife take her
To that stupid restaurant you like...

I have lost my love
I have lost my love, I have lost my love for you
Every little bit, every part of it
There is nothing more to do
Oh I have lost my faith
I have lost my faith, in everything you said was true
When the dust has settled down
I realised I lost all love for you...

Ooh, it's the same old story
Ooh, now my life before me
Is beautiful, and it's waiting for me

'Cause I found myself, yes I found myself
So I learnt a lot from you, Oh I will never change
Not for someone else
My own woman through and through

Oh, I have lost my love
I have lost my love, I have lost my love for you
Every little bit, every part of it
There is nothing more to do
Oh I have lost my faith
I have lost my faith, in everything you said was true
When the dust has settled down
I realised I lost all love for you...
I lost all love for you
