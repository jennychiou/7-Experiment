Held my breath as the last wave pulled me 
Under under
What doesn't kill you makes you so much 
Stronger stronger
Can you feel this pain rushing through these veins
Driving me insane but I won't break...

I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
Dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher...
Dancing with a broken heart

I'm gonna bury all the past now six feet 
Under under
I'm gonna make a storm from lightning 
And thunder thunder
I won't let dogs lie in their peace and quiet
I'm moving on to another time

I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
Dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher...
Dancing with a broken heart
I'll be dancing with a broken heart

Dancing with a broken heart 

Dancing with a broken heart 

Dancing with a broken heart 

Can you feel this pain rushing through these veins
Driving me insane but I won't break...

I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
Dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher...

Dancing with a broken heart

I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
Dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher...
Dancing with a broken heart
Be dancing with a broken heart
Dancing with a broken heart
