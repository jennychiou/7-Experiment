Oh, you drive me crazy

I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Just turn loose and let it be
This waitin' 'round is killin' me

You drive me crazy like no one else
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself

I can't get any rest
People say that I'm obsessed
You're everything I want in life
But to me that's no surprise
And what I have I'll give to you
I hope you feel the same way, too

Cause you drive me crazy
Like no one else
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself

I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone
You drive me crazy, yes it's true
I'd give it all up just to be with you

Cause you drive me crazy like no one else
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself

Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself

Oh, you drive me crazy like nobody else
You drive me crazy, can't help myself
I'm gonna hold you all night long
And I'm gonna love you till the cows come home
Drive me crazy like a rock in my shoe
I can't keep my mind off-a you
Drive me crazy and that's a fact
You're the one that's a makin' me feel like that

You drive me crazy
You drive me crazy, I'm a lunatic
I'd do anything for your sweet kiss
Drive me crazy, can't help myself
Drive me crazy like nobody else
You drive me crazy
