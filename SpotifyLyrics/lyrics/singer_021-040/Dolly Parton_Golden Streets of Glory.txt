Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy

There's a city where the streets are paved in gold
A land where the milk and the honey flow
And a mansion which for me
'Cause my bible tells the story
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory

Green meadows where the little children play
No sorrow there, just one long happy day
And none will litter there except the pure and the holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory

And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I walk on
And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing

Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory

And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I'll walk on

And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing

Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
