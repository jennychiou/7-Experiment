Lookin' outta my windowpane
Tears minglin' with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry, just like old Hank
Starin' down the city street
Feelin' empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank
A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and I just be me
Ho-o-ome
Where the warm wind's blowin' and the river's flowin' along
Like a lazy bum in the midday sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome home
I left home I was seventeen
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true, I've had good luck
I ain't complain' that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
