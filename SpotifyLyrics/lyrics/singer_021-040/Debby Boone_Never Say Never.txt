You know we've done so many things 
We said we'd never do 
But time creeps in and changes hearts 
And nevers end up haunting you 

I said I'd never love someone 
'Cause love was not returned 
But hearts are led so easily 
And soon the heart has lessons learned 

So never say never 
On where love may grow 
Never say never 
For with love you never know 
Love you never know 

So don't tell me love's not for us 
Be careful what you say 
For love can hide from what you you see 
And only be a smile away 

So never say never 
On where love may grow 
Never say never 
For with love you never know 
So never say never 
On where love may grow 
Never say never 
For with love you never know 
With love you never know
