When it's over
All over
There's really nothing more that's left to say
We both seem to know
What started out so right today could end up
As you go your separate ways

The laughter
The good times
All fade into a last and sad goodbye
And you and I
Too soon to really know all that we've lost now
Too late to even try
Now and then you still pretend
That love like this could never end

But it's over
All over
And it's like the morning sun has left the sky
And all that's left
Are long and lonely nights that seem forever
There's nothing left to say but goodbye

When it's over
All over
And it's like the morning sun has left the sky
And all that's left
Are long and lonely nights that seem forever
There's nothing left to say but goodbye
