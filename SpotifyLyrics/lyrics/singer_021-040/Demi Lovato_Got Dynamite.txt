I can't take your hand and lead you to the water
I can't make you feel what you don't feel but you know you wanna
Find out how to crack me, log in, try to hack me

Underneath the surface 
There's so much you need to know
And you might feel like you're drowning 
But that's what I need to let go

Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses

Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite

Got dynamite?

I can't paint this picture just so you can hang it
I can't wait for you to understand if you just don't get it
Find out how to crack me, log in, try to hack me

Underneath the surface 
There's so much you need to know
And you might feel that you're drowning
But that's what I need to let go

Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses

Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite

When the walls come crashing down
I hope you're standing right in front of me
Where my past lies all around me
'Cause all you need to save me is to intervene
And make the walls come crashing down

Got, got dynamite?

Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses

Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite 

Got dynamite, got dynamite, got dynamite, got dynamite?
