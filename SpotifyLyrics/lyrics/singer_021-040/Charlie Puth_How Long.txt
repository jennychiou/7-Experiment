Alright
Ooh, yeah

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you play my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
I promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been goin' on?
You been creepin' 'round on me
While you callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You been actin' so shady (shady)
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Ooh-oh (yeah)
Ooh-oh (encore)
Ooh-ooh-oh

I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmh
I tried, and I tried, but you'll never see that
You're the only I wanna love, oh, yeah

She said "Boy, tell me honestly" (honestly)
"Was it real or just for show?", yeah (real or just for show?)
She said, "Save your apologies" (apologies, yeah)
"Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been goin' on?
You been creepin' 'round on me (on me)
While you callin' me "baby" (baby)
How long has this been goin' on?
You been actin' so shady (shady)
I've been feelin' it lately (lately), baby

Ooh-oh (yeah)
Ooh-oh (encore)

Ooh-oh, you gotta go tell me now
Ooh-ooh-oh

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
