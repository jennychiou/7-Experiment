Here we sit lookin' at each other
Seems we're at a loss of what to say
Ties bind us both two someone else
We don't want to hurt but we must break away

And tonight I'll sit home a' thinkin'
And tonight I'll sit home a' drinkin'
We both live in separate homes
Where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late, burnin' the midnight oil

Tomorrow, we'll meet here in this same place
With love and desire that just won't wait
In each others' arms we'll dream for a little while
Then when it's time to leave it'll nearly drive us wild

And tonight again I'll sit home a' thinkin'
And tonight again I'll sit home a' drinkin'
We both live in separate homes
Where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late, burnin' the midnight oil
