Change, like secrets in the wind
I hear the whispers madame butterfly
Spread your precious wings
I watch you fly away

I know, I can't change fate of that July the 8th
And it was never the same 
I know, this stage is frightening but it's oh so enlightening
Is this how karma goes?

Who would have thought when chance came calling
That this would be my defining story
And who could have guessed on my life's journey
I could find my way through this extraordinary day

Why? 
Had my universe gone mad? 
Was there no compassion?
I was wrong 
So many loving hands
Reaching out to hold me

I know, I can't change fate of that July the 8th
And it was never the same 
I know that this stage is frightening but it's oh so enlightening
Is this how karma goes?

Who would have thought when chance came calling
That this would be my defining story
And who could have guessed on my life's journey
I could find my way through this extraordinary day

Nothing is isolated

I know, I can't change fate of that July the 8th
And it was never the same 
I know that this stage is frightening but it's oh so enlightening
Is this how karma goes?

Extraordinary day

This would be my defining story
And who could have guessed on my life's journey
I could find my way through this extraordinary day

Extraordinary day
