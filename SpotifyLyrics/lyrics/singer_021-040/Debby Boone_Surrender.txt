Like the song in the wind
Lord you called me again
Surrender

And I find myself drawn to your voice
As I lean toward the choice
Surrender

Like the echoing sound of the sea
Lord you echo in me
Surrender

Like a dancer I'll follow again
To the music within
Surrender

For the freedom I seek
Is the word that you speak
Running deep as a song of my soul
To be totally sure and totally yours and totally... Surrender

Like the song of the rain
You repeat the refrain
Surrender

And I know that your music is mine
And I follow in time
Surrender

For the freedom I seek
Is the word that you speak
Running deep as a song of my soul
To be totally sure and totally yours and totally... Surrender

Like the song in the wind
Lord you called me again
Surrender

And at last I can soar like a bird
On the wings of the word
Surrender
