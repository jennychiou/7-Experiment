I was just with you on your birthday
And I met your whole family
But on the way home you kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask "Who is that babe?"
And the way you said "Nobody"
I knew the rumors, they were more than just rumors

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you, you were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that it's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it, you were my girl

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

Lately you've been making excuses
And the stories ain't adding up
But I just complied when you looked into my eyes
Every time that I tried to confront you
There's always somewhere you've gotta run to
The warning signs, they were more than just warning signs

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

('Cause) Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you, you were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that it's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it, you were my girl

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You were my girl

Baby I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Baby I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
You were my girl, yeah

Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you, you were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that it's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it, you were my girl

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You were my girl

Baby I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Baby I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
You were my girl
