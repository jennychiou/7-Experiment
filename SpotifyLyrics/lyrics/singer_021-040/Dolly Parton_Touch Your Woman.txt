We can't always both be right 
We sometimes disagree 
But you've got the right to speak your mind 
An' it's the same with me 
When the anger's at an end 
And you want inside my arms again 
All you have to do to make it right is just 

Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Let me know, let me know everything's alright 

There are times when I should be strong 
When I'm awfully weak 
When the sudden blows of life have brought me to my knees 
Woman needs a helpin' hand 
Needs someone to understand 
Needs the man she loves to help her stand, so 

Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Let me know, let me know everything's alright 

And when the busy day is done 
You lay by my side 
You know exactly what it takes to keep me satisfied 
You know exactly what I need and I always go to sleep in peace 
Thanking God that you belong to me, so 

Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Let me know, let me know everything's alright
