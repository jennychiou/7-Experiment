Mama, I remember what you told me 
You said you wait for love before you fall 
But, mama, I am sorry, I guess it's gonna be love after all 
'Cause mama, when he holds me 
The air is thick and sweet 
He asked me if I'd come tonight 
And hold him in his sleep 

And I'm almost in love 
I can feel myself fallin' 
Yes, I'm almost in love 
I can hear my heart fallin' 
'Cause I'm almost in 
Yes, I'm almost in love 

Mama, I've grown into a woman 
I been growing stronger and stronger day by day 
Mama, you know about children 
You raise them then they'll go away 
Mama, when he holds me 
He thrills me through and through 
So dry your eyes and teach me how to say goodbye to you 

And I'm almost in love 
I can feel myself fallin' 
Yes, I'm almost in love 
I can hear my heart fallin' 
'Cause I'm almost in 
Yes, I'm almost in love 

Yes I'm almost in love 
I can feel myself fallin' 
Yes I'm almost in love 
I can hear my heart fallin' 
Yes I'm almost in love 
I can feel myself fallin' 
Yes I'm almost in love 
I can hear my heart fallin' 
'Cause I'm almost 
Yes, I'm almost in love
