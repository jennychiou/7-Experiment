In my mind I've made love to you often 
But only in my mind can it be so 
'Cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me 
And if I did, I'm sure that he would know 
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell 
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well 
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes 
I know my guilt would show and he would know 

But I must admit you're someone very special 
And it would be so easy to let go 
Makin' love to you could be so easy 
But if I did, I'm sure that he would know 

Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell 
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well 
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes 
I know my guilt would show and he would know 

My conscience just won't let me make love to you 
I know it would be sweet, but I just can't 
When I go home to him I must be able 
To look him in the eyes and say I ain't 

'Cause he would know, yes, he could tell 
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well 
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes 
I know my guilt would show and he would know 
He would know
