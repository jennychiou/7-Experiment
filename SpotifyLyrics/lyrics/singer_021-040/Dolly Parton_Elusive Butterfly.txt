You might wake up some morning 
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind 
And if you're quick enough to rise 
You'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow 
Out on the new horizon 
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings 
And if the sleep has left your ears 
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow 
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you 
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of 
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love 

You might have heard my footsteps 
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind 
I might have even called your name 
As I ran searching after something to believe in 
You might have seen me runnin' 
Through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind 
If you remember something there 
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing 

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you 
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of 
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love 

Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love 
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder 
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
