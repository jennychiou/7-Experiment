Out of the pages of books that I've read
I can recall that somewhere someone said
If you don't succeed, try again

So I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand
Using every ounce of strength that I have
Don't turn me away

'Cause I live and breathe you
God knows how much I need you
And I'll never leave you
God knows I love you

Too insecure is lovers who fail
The princess and the white knight
Live in fairy tales or so the story goes

We read so right from the very start
But here we are both with broken hearts
Let's not part this way

'Cause I live and breathe you
God knows how much I need you
And I'll never leave you
God knows I love you

Time ran away and took you by the hand
If I can't bring you back, maybe time can

'Cause I live and breathe you
God knows how much I need you
And I'll never leave you
God knows how much I love you

God knows how much I love you
God knows how much I love you
God knows how much I love you
