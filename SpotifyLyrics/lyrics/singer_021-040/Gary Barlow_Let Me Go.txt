A room full of sadness
A broken heart
And only me to blame
For every single part
No Science or Religion
Could make this whole
To be loved, but never loved
To have, but never hold
It's a life alone, and a desperate need
To be held to be loved so
This is gonna take a bit of getting used to, but I know what's right for you

Fly high and let me go
That sky will save your soul
When you pass by then you'll know
That this gonna take a bit of getting used to but I know what's right for you
Let me go

A head full of madness
And no where safe
When tears aren't big enough, and love turns into hate
It's a life alone, and a desperate need
To be held to be loved so
That this gonna take a bit of getting used to but I know what's right for you

Fly high and let me go
That sky will save your soul
When you pass by then you'll know
That this gonna take a bit of getting used to but I know what's right for you

So let me go life will get better
Find the love I never gave ya
I know you lie there waiting all night long, so find where you belong

Fly high and let me go (Let me go)
That sky will save your soul (Let it save your soul tonight)
Fly high and let me go (Let me go let me go)
That sky will save your soul
But this gonna take a bit of getting used to but I know what's right for you
Let me go
