I've had to think up a way to survive 
Since you said it's over 
Told me good-bye 
I just can't make it one day without you 
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true 
Rivers flow backwards 
Valleys are high 
Mountains are level 
Truth is a lie 
I'm perfectly fine 
And I don't miss you 
The sky is green 
And the grass is blue 

How much can a heart and a troubled mind take 
Where is that fine line before it all breaks 
Can one end their sorrow 
Just cross over it 
And into that realm of insanitive bliss 

There's snow in the tropics 
There's ice on the sun 
It's hot in the Arctic 
And crying is fun 
And I'm happy now 
And I'm glad we're through 
And the sky is green 
And the grass is blue 

And the rivers flow backwards 
And my tears are dry 
Swans hate the water 
And eagles can't fly 
But I'm alright now 
Now that I'm over you 
And the sky is green 
And the grass is blue 
And I don't love you 
And the grass is blue
