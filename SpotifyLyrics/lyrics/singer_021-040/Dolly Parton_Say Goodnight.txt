The city streets are empty, it's beginning to feel like dawn 
The lights have gone out, the sun is coming on 
We've been standing here for hours, watching the river flow 
You walked into my life tonight, but if you've got to go

Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on 
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes 
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while 
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye

I've been saving all my secrets, spending my time alone 
I've given up on the life I used to know 
I've been waiting for one person to love me like a friend 
You walked into my life tonight and if it's got to end

Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on 
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes 
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while 
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye

Oh it easy now to tell you how I'm dreaming 'bout tomorrow 
'Cause you'll be there to share that dream with me 
But now it's time to close your eyes, put this night away 
And keep it safe, a perfect memory

Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on 
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes 
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while 
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye

Let me touch your smile and hold you for a little while 
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye

Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on 
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes 
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while 
Then say goodnight but don't you say goodbye

Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on 
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes 
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while 
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
