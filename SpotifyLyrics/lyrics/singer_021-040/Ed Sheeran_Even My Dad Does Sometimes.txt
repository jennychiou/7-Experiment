It's all right to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's all right to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

It's all right to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
It's all right to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today hold on

So live life like you're giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path
And hold on
