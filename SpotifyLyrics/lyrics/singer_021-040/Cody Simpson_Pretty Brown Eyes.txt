I like this right here

This girl she came 'round
The corner, looking like a model
Magazine figure, she was shaped like a bottle
Long straight hair, she was fly as a bird
First time ever I was lost for words
Felt so right, couldn't be wrong
Love at first sight, if that exists at all
I couldn't move, felt like I was stuck
And then baby girl looked up

And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Watcha doin' later tonight?
Mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Watcha doin' later tonight?
Mind if I spend time with you?

This girl she was a lil hottie,
She know she got it
Came from the city so she loves to party
The JT song that can move that body
She dancing all night long

'Cause I can tell that she was a wild one
That's why I was shy at first,
But I finally worked up the nerve

And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Watcha doin' later tonight?
Mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Watcha doin' later tonight?
Mind if I spend time with you?

Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you

Like hey hey little pretty brown eyes
Don't cha ever be looking at them other guys
Ain't never had a surfer like me
Start swimming over here and ride my wave
'Cause I see that you party like there's no tomorrow
Let's leave the party, I'll grab my guitar
I got the keys, so jump in my car
Sit back relax, Australia's kinda far

Hey there pretty brown eyes
Watcha doin' later tonight?
Mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
Watcha doin' later tonight?
Mind if I spend time with you?

Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
