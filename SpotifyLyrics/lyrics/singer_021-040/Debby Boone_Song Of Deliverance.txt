Standing at my station camped upon the battleground
Though I can't see my enemy, I know that he is all around
So many voices speaking, telling me I'm wrong; can they be right?
I have the choice to weaken, or to stand up strong and fight
But the only defense that I can raise
Is lifting up an anthem of Your praise

Oh Lord, Your loving kindness is everlasting
That's why I sing
My Lord, your loving kindness endures forever
And You are able to deliver me
Deliver me

Lord in my confusion all my strength is giving in
My adversary's everywhere, it seems that there's no way to win
Then I hear Your voice all through me telling me this battle's Yours, not mine
I have no choice left to me but to yield to Your design
As You take it from my hands what can I do
But to lift them up in sacrifice to You

Oh Lord, Your loving kindness is everlasting
That's why I sing
My Lord, your loving kindness endures forever
And You are able to deliver me
Deliver me

And now the hope of Your salvation
Is burning in me like a flame
I come before You now rejoicing
And with this song of deliverance proclaim

Oh Lord, Your loving kindness is everlasting
That's why I sing
My Lord, your loving kindness endures forever
And You are able to deliver me
Deliver me
