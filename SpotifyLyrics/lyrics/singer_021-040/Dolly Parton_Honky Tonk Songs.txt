Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink 
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think 
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance 
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't 
You see I loved him, he left me for a girl half my age 
I relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played 
I listen to Haggard, ole Hank, and George Jones 
But why don't more women sing honky tonk songs? 

Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs? 
About the heartaches and the tough breaks 
And the men that's done 'em wrong 
There are others just like me that are hurtin' to the bone 
So why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs 

Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs 
Honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones 
Judge not lest you be judged, who can cast the first stone 
Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs

(All you lonely women sing) 
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs 
About the heartaches and the tough breaks 
And all the men that's done us wrong 
There's a whole lotta women I know would sing along 
So why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
