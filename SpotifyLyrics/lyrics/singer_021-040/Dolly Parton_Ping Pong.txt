Ping pong
I use to like
Ping pong
Now I'm in a ding dong, ping pong game of love with you

Ping pong
It scares me now
Ping pong
My heart is the ball in a ding dong, ping pong game with you

I serve it to you
And you knock it back
You hit it so hard, hard, hard
Its startin' to crack

Ping pong
You're smashed again
Ping pong
And I'm losing this ding dong, ping pong game of love with you

I serve it to you
And you knock it back
You hit it so hard, hard, hard
Its starting to crack

Ping pong
You're smashed again
Ping pong
I'm losing this ding dong, ping pong game of love with you

Ping pong
I use to like
Ping pong
Now I'm in a ding dong, ping pong game of love with you

Ping pong
It scares me now...
