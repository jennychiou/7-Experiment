Lord I find myself needing you
Like I've never felt before
In all of the darkness around me
Everyday my hungers growing more

It's clear to me now You are my only refuge
My port in a troubled seas
Help me to give my life completely to You
And make me only what You want me to be

Lord just keep the flame burnin' in my heart
Light my way with the fire of Your spirit
Keep the flame burnin' in my heart
And let it spread to who ever comes near it
Lord just keep the flame burnin' in my heart

Children, He knows what you're going through
He suffered more than you'll ever know
Well, He's drawin' us closer
Down closer to Him
He'll be back soon
You've got to get ready to go

Lord just keep the flame burnin' in my heart
Light my way with the fire of Your spirit
Keep the flame burnin' in my heart
And let it spread to who ever comes near it
Lord just keep the flame burnin' in my heart

Well there's no time for complacency
There's no room for compromise
Just walk straight and strong
'Cause it won't belong
Till we see Him split the eastern skies

Lord just keep the flame burnin' in my heart
Light my way with the fire of Your spirit
Keep the flame burnin' in my heart
And let it spread to who ever comes near it
Lord just keep the flame burnin' in my heart
