Momma moved out 
Daddy sold the house 
They split up the money 
And went on their way 
And all the king's horses 
And all the king's men 
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again 

Starting over again 
Where should they begin 
'Cause they've never been out on their own 
Starting over again 
Where do you begin 
When your dreams are all shattered 
And the kids are all grown 
And the whole world cries 

Got an apartment 
She moved in with her sisters 
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends 
While she sits at home 
Just sorting out pieces 
Of left over memories 
From thirty odd years 

Starting over again 
Where do you begin 
You've never been out on your own 
Starting over again 
Never any end 

What will the neighbors say? 
They're talking talk, its small town news 
Facing fifty years old 
Making up a happy home 
And this far down the road 
You find yourself alone 
Two fools  

Starting over again 
Now where do you begin 
When you've never been out on your own 
Starting over again 
Never any end 
When your dreams are all shattered 
And the kids are all grown 
And all the king's horses 
And all the king's men 
Could never put mommy and daddy back together 
Back together, again
