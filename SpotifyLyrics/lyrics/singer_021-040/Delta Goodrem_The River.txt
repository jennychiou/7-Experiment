(Preacher, take me down)
(Take me down the river, river)

It's not what I had planned when I was walking in
I didn't know what I'd see
Stepping through the door, their clothes were on the floor
Was something like a bad dream
And then yesterday, before I could think
I didn't know what happened
All I knew was this
How could he commit a crime against our passion

The moment that I saw them kiss
I knew it had to end like this

Preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
I couldn't help myself
When I saw him with her, with her
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
(River, river, river, river)

The writing's on the wall, but it was his fault
How could anybody blame me
I swear to tell the truth, and if you only knew
I swear you'd do the same thing

If you give me one more chance
I'll never shoot him down again

Preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
I couldn't help myself
When I saw him with her, with her
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river

(Take me down)
(Take me down)
(Take me down)
(River, river)
(Take me down)

Preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
I couldn't help myself
When I saw him with her, with her
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
(River, river, river, river)
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
