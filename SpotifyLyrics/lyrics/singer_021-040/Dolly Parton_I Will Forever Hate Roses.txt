I used to love it when roses would come
The card always read, "You're my number one"
But love never goes the way one supposes
And I will forever hate roses

You sent me roses, I thought it was nice
Opened the card and it read, "goodbye"
You're movin' on as this chapter closes
And I will forever hate roses

I'll never see a rose from now on
That will not remind me that you're really gone
Don't trust the rose for the danger it poses
I will forever hate roses

The fragrance of roses will last throughout time
Their beauty will linger, but not in my mind
No, I'll love the daisies, the tulips, the posies
But I will forever hate roses

And I'll never see a rose from now own
That will not remind me that you're really gone
Oh, and don't trust the rose for the pain it imposes
I will forever hate roses
Now you're movin' on as this chapter closes
And I will forever hate roses
