Here I go once again
With my suitcase in my hand
And I'm running away down River Road
And I swear, once again, that I'm never coming home
Yes, I'm chasing my dreams down River Road

Mama said, listen child
You're too old to run wild
You're too big to be fishin' with the boys these days

So I grabbed some clothes and I ran
Stole five dollars from a sugar can
A twelve year old jail breaker runnin' away

Here I go once again
With my suitcase in my hand
And I'm running away down River Road
And I swear, once again, that I'm never coming home
I'm chasing my dreams down River Road

Well, I married a pretty good man
And he tries to understand
But he knows I've got leavin' on my mind these days

When I get that urge to roam
I'm just like a kid again
The same old jail breaker runnin' away

Here I go once again
With my suitcase in my hand
And I'm running away down River Road
And I swear, once again, that I'm never coming home
I'm chasing my dreams down River Road
