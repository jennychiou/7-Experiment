Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through

Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried

I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' for the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you

Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
