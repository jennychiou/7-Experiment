Fighting for no reward
Cold in the rain I'm tossing and turning your words ever burning my heart
Love's an electric storm of pleasure and pain
Where thunder and lightening are crashing
And striking us down

Two people shipwrecked
Stranded alone
Praying for dry land to save our souls
Hurricane season just knocked us down
Emotional suicides running the ground

Fighting for no reward
Cold in the rain I'm tossing and turning your words ever burning my heart
Love's an electric storm of pleasure and pain
Where thunder and lightening are crashing And striking us

I won't give up never never
I won't be struck by the weather
Hold on when the wind's so strong
Tell me how can we find our way home in love's electric storm

Feels like our last chance to get out alive
Will we survive this treachous night
Predators waiting circling around
Sky full of fireworks burn without sound

Fighting for no reward
Cold in the rain I'm tossing and turning your words ever burning my heart
Love's an electric storm of pleasure and pain where
Thunder and lightening are crashing And striking us

I won't give up never never
I won't be struck by the weather
Hold on when the wind's so strong
Tell me how can we find our way home
In loves electric storm

Have we never been stronger?
Have we never been tighter?
But we're close to the wire again
Have we never been safer?

Fighting for no reward
Cold in the rain I'm tossing and turning your words ever burning my heart
Love's an electric storm of pleasure and pain
Where thunder and lightening are crashing
And striking us down

I won't give up never never
I won't be struck by the weather
Hold on when the wind's so strong
Tell me how can we find our way home
Tell me how can we find our way home
In love's electric storm
