I fell picture perfect
On and off the shelf
To a broken frame of mind
A broken frame of mind

It comes back and haunts me
A bullet undercover
It fooled me every time
Fooled every time

But even if I lose it all
I've got so much left to give
I won't give up, no no
My heart's on the frontline, I'm not afraid

I will love you like I've never been hurt 
Run through fire for you like I've been burned 
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost 
Gonna give it all I've got 
I will love you, I will love like I've
Never been hurt, never been hurt

You set fire to ashes
You fought through the darkness
And brought me back to life
You brought me back to life

So even if I lose it all 
I've got so much left to give
I won't give up, no no
My heart's on the frontline, I'm not afraid 

I will love you like I've never been hurt 
Run through fire for you like I've been burned 
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost 
Gonna give it all I've got
I will love you, I will love like I've
Never been hurt, never been hurt

I will love you and forever
I will love you like I never
Like I never heard goodbye
Like I never heard a lie
Like I'm falling into love
For the first time, yeah yeah

I will love you like I've never been hurt 
Run through fire for you like I've been burned 
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost 
Gonna give it all I've got 
I will love you, I will love like I've
Never been hurt, never been hurt
