If you hear me crying in the night 
Pretend that you don't hear me it's alright 
Don't ask me why I'm crying, please don't make a sound 
I don't know why, it's just the way I am 
And if you think I act a little strange 
And you don't understand when I do things 
Like running through the fields while the rain is pouring down 
I don't know why, it's just the way I am 

And even though you may not understand me 
I hope that you'll accept me like I am 
For there are many sides of me, my mind and spirit must be free 
And I might smile when other folks would frown 
I don't know why, it's just the way I am 

I might go out chasing butterflies 
And if I fail to catch one I might cry 
And if you want me you might find me in the meadow walking 'round 
I don't know why, it's just the way I am 

I might be home and busy cleaning house 
And in the middle of my work I might go out 
And go play games with children at the playground 
It makes me happy, and that's just the way I am 

And even though you may not understand me 
I hope that you'll accept me like I am 
For there are childish sides of me 
My mind and spirit must be free 
I might smile when you think I should frown 
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
