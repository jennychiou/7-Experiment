I'll be home for Christmas you can count on me
Fileds have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams

Christmas Eve will find me...
If only in my dreams
Yes I'll be home I'll be home for Christmas
