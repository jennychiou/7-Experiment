Well a good way down the rail-road track,
There was this little old run down shack
And in it lived a man I'd never se-e-e-een
Folk said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you'd better not set foot on his land
But I didn't think nobody could be that mean

So I took me out walking down the rail-road track
I was gonna go down to that little old shack
An' just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And he growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say" well, who are you?"
Ooh and there he stood in the door of that shack
And his beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said " what yuh doing snooping round my place"
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said " come on in, pull you up a chair,
You might as well since you're already here"
And he said " you can call me Joshua"
Joshua Joshua what you doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no
We talked till the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talked when it come daylight
There was just so much we had to say
I spent my life in an orphans home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said"yeah" when he asked if I'd stay
Ooh we grew close as time went on
And that little ole shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little ole shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
Its plenty good enough for me and Joshua
Joshua Joshua why your just what I've been a looking for
Joshua Joshua you ain't gonna be lonesome anymore

Oh no

Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
