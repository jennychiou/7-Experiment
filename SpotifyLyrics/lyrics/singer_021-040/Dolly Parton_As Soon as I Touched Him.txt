He came to me like a bright idea
Shining like the sun
And the way his eyes burned into mine
I knew he must be the one

Oh, he drew me in like a magnet does
So I couldn't pull away
But the kind of lovin' that I gave to him
I'm not ashamed to say

Oh, as soon as I touched him
Soon as I touched him
I felt like a woman
And the feelin' made me close my eyes
I was born again
An' I heard myself cryin'
Like a new born baby cries

He told me what I meant to him
Swore that I was sent to him
All my lovin' went to him
Now he's gone, oh, he's gone

Now I hide myself from the light of day
So no one else can see
A part of him that I can't forget
That's growin' deep inside of me

Oh, as soon as I touched him
Soon as I touched him
I felt like a woman
And the feelin' made me close my eyes
I was born again
An' I heard myself cryin'
Like our new born baby cries

Oh, as soon as I touched him
Soon as I touched him
I felt like a woman
And the feelin' made me close my eyes
I was born again
An' I heard myself cryin'
Like a new born baby criess
