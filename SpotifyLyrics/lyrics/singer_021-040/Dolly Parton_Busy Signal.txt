Busy signal 
That's what I get when I call you 
Busy busy 
Talking to someone new 
I wish I knew 

I shouldn't worry 'cause it's probably his mother 
Or then again it could even be his little brother 
On the line 
Making me lose my mind 

Hang up hang up hang up hang up 
Come on hang up hang up hang up 
Gotta talk to my baby 
Gotta tell him I'm sorry 

Busy signal 
How can I tell him I'm sorry 
When I said I didn't care 
I didn't mean a word I said 
Talking outta my head 

I've got to reach him now and tell him that I love him 
And from now on I'll stay right by his side and love him 
All the time 
So please somebody quit tying up the line 

Hang up hang up hang up hang up 
Come on hang up hang up hang up 
Gotta talk to my baby 
Gotta tell him I'm sorry 
I didn't mean to hurt you baby 
I really really love you baby
