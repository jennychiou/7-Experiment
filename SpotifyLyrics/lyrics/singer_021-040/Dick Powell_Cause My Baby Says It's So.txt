Lots of little questions used to bother me.
I know all the answers now.
I know every little prayer for, every little why and how.
I have no diploma, I have no degree from a university.
But I didn't really miss much
As long as I know this much.

White is black and black is white
For no good reason that I know
Only that my baby says it's so.
Night and day and day is night
The moon at noon is all aglow.
Just because my baby says it's so.

I caught her kissing someone else to my confusion.
She said what I saw was an optical illusion.
I was wrong and she was right 
And as I said a while ago
That's because my baby says it's so.

I caught her kissing someone else to my confusion.
She said what I saw was an optical illusion.
I was wrong and she was right, 
And as I said a while ago
That's because my baby says it-
That's because my baby says it-
That's because my baby says it's so.
That's because my baby says it's so!
