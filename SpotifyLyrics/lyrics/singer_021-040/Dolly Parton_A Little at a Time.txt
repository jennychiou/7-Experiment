Well, the lady said will this be cash and I thought boy if that'en ain't a laugh
Why I don't carry money of that kind
Just put it on my charge account on account of I can't pay you now
I'll pay for it a little at a time.

I'm just an average working girl trying to get along in this old world
Looking for that rich man I might find
But up till now the times are hard I'm living on my credit card
And paying for life a little at time.

A little at a time that's how I pay my bills
That's the story of the working girl
Always going overboard buying things I can't afford
In this charge account credit card pay for it a little at a time world.

My weekly check don't amount to a lot
But I'm making payments on what I got
At the end of the month I ain't got one thin dime
And this old car I bought brand new but I'm still payin' on it too
I've been payin' for it a little at a time.

Got a new apartment I just moved in and I'll do well to pay the rent
It's unfurnished so a bargain I must find
I saw a sign in a store downtown house goods for nothing down
Pay for it a little at a time.

A little at a time that's how I pay my bill
That's the story of the working girl
Always going overboard buying things I can't afford
In this charge account credit card pay for it a little at a time world.

I want to pay on my layaway here's a dollar on my mink collar.
