It seems we lost the feeling somewhere along the way
The distance now between us grows farther day by day
We never love each other we're just passing off the time
Wasting love yours and mine

Wasting love love divine wasting love yours and mine
There's nothing left between us just the ties that bind
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love

We just might find happiness with somebody new
For all the love we're wasting surely could be used
Not long ago our love was so true and kind
Now it's been wasted yours love and mine

Wasting love love divine...
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love
