When the rain is pouring, flooding at your feet
And better days feel far behind
When the sun is hiding rays of light you need
And the clouds, they fill your mind
When the fire in your soul is feeling cold
And the lights burn out, I'll be your flame

Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be next to you soon as I can
When you're down and out and your heart's in doubt
Don't know what to do, I'll be there with you

And my love said
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
I will be here just call my name
And my love said
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
I will be here just call my name

When the mountain feels to high for you to climb
And you can't breathe, I'll see what's near
When the night has gone to dark to see the stars
And you can't wish 'cause it's out of reach

Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be next to you soon as I can
When you're down and out and your heart's in doubt
Don't know what to do, I'll be there with you

And my love said
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
I will be here just call my name
And my love said
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
I will be here just call my name

Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be next to you soon as I can
When you're down and out and your heart's in doubt
Don't know what to do, I'll be there with you

You can spend your days living like you have lost
Or you can change, rewrite the page
We could set the world on fire for the day
I'll be your flame, I will be your flame

Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be next to you soon as I can
When you're down and out and your heart's in doubt
Don't know what to do, I'll be there with you

And my love said
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
I will be here just call my name
Yeah
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ya
I will be here just call my name

Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be next to you soon as I can
When you're down and out and your heart's in doubt
Don't know what to do, I'll be there with you

I will be here, just call my name
