Baby, won't you come out tonight
Just come up the hill
'Cause there's a full moon on the risin'
Hey baby, can't you steal away
You know I really need to see you tonight
I just got word you was packin' it in
What's the matter
This old town got you crazy again
I can see the sad look in your eyes
But I don't know how to say goodbye

And tomorrow, you're gonna have your day
Take your wife and you're gonna run away
Baby while I'm wailin'
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'

Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mmmmm, baby, won't you come out tonight

Oh baby, won't you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
Let me gaze into your eyes till we both go blind
Oh baby, can I see you tonight

I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast
An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks
An' when ya' go, baby don't look back

There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
No more dancin' after hours
Singin' in the showers
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'

Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight

I'll meet ya' on the corner
And you'll be there at midnight
Oh baby, can you steal away
You know I really want to see ya' tonight

Ooh baby, can you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
Oh baby, can you steal away
I really wanna see you tonight

Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Come up the hill
There's a full moon on the rise
Oh baby, can ya' steal away
Baby, won't ya' come out tonight
