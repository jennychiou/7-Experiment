It's a true sign of a soldier
Taking care of the hearts around us
And the whole world loves a hero
A leader and a shoulder to cry on
That's what you are to me
Everyone around can see yeah

When we're face to face oh I
When the music plays oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place
When we're face to face
Yeah we do know

You can measure the strength of a human
By the weight of the love around them
One sweet light in the darkness
Guided us all like a pilot
That's what you are to me yeah
Everyone around believes yeah

When we're face to face oh I
When the music plays oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place
When we're face to face

When you live your life with the passion
Taking nothing for granted
You made me believe if you give love, you will find it oh oh oh oh oh
You, you are the world to me yeah
A heart as wide as the ocean
You aim to climb every mountain
And the unknown in you understand it
Yeah you do, oh yeah

When we're face to face oh I
When the music plays oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place

When we're face to face oh I
When the music plays oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place
When we're face to face
