Darling, will you love me forever
Always, always
Will you keeps these vows we mad together
Always, always
Will your love be as strong if my dreams will go wrong
Always, always

Darling, will you stay with me forever
Always, always
Will your love remain through stormy weather
Always, always
To walk the roads that might get rough
Always, always

In return for your love I'll be true as stars above
Always, always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real
Always, always
