We don't take away one happy moment we won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away

I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once but I wasn't even close not even close
Well you make me wanna call you sweet names
For each day I love you more and we won't never take away
We don't take away one happy moment...
Love is give and take but we don't take away take away mhm
