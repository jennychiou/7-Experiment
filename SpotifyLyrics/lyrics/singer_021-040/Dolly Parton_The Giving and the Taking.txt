I keep on a' givin' 
And I took all the takin' 
I gave all my love to you 
And I took all your hurt 
I treated you so good 
But you treated me like dirt 
They say love is give and take 
Now my poor heart is breakin' 
I keep on a' givin' 
And I took all the takin' 
I always gave you everything 
That I knew how to give I would for you 
I treated you too good for my own good 
Now I'm along and left forsaken 
I keep on a' givin' 
And took all the takin' 
The giving and the takin' 
Has caused my heart to break 
I've given all that I can give 
And I have taken all that I can take 

The giving and the takin' 
Has caused my heart to break 
I've given all that I can give 
And I have takin' all that I can take
