I'm impressed by the wrong kinds of people 
Although I never think that they know 
And all the lives that I lead belong to others 
And one that is mine I can't say that I know 
And I long to be one by the others 
Who seem so far and further than me 
And oh, if wishes were true 
But if you wouldn't mind 
I'd rather be alone 

I've been down and for too long forgotten 
On occasion I'll stay there for days 
And I act like a clown and I tear myself down 
Just for someone to fill me with praise 
And I long to be loved by the others 
And I long to be taken for me 
And oh, if wishes were true 
But if you wouldn't mind 
I'd rather be alone 

I'm inspired by the wrong inspiration 
Even times when the light flickered low 
I'd relight it again and since you let me in 
I'm not hurting for somewhere to go 
Still I long to be loved by the others 
But I long to be loved just by me 
But oh, no wishes are true 
So if you wouldn't mind 
I'd rather be alone 

And if you wouldn't mind 
I'd rather be alone
