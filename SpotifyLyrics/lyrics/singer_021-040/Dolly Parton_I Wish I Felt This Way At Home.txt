If I, could be with you forever
My restles heart
Would never want to roam

I've never been loved
The way you love me

I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me

It's words without speaking
And I don't believe that
God would call this wrong
Your arms are the refuge
I was seeking

I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me

But I don't, and I won't
We did all that we could

He and I
We tried hard
But it's just no good
I may never be free
'Cause I've no reason
And I don't expect you to wait that long
But I'll say one more time

As I'm leavin'

I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me

Yes, I wish I felt this way at home
