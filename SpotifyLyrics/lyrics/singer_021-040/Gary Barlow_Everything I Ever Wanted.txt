You're everything I ever wanted and more
You're the girl that I've needed for so long
I think I'm old enough to know now
The reason I feel the way I do now

In my own words this love is so meant to be
It's in your eyes each time you're listening to me
I'm saying things I've never said before
And so naturally you're coming back for more
There's a reason why this love is changing my life

You're everything I ever wanted and more
You're in my mind, in my heart, in my soul
Each time I think about reason, my work, losing time
I just think about you and leave responsibility behind
And lead me back to you

My day it opens with your head on my shoulder
I love to kiss, touch, I love to hold ya
Our time it moves so fast
Every hour's a second till at last
We will sleep one night and that night is forever

You're everything I ever wanted and more
You're in my mind, in my heart, in my soul
Each time I think about reason, my work, losing time
I just think about you and leave responsibility behind

Everything, everything I want
Ooh oh yeah
You mean everything and more to me

There's a reason why this love is changing my life

'Cause you're everything I ever wanted and more
You're in my mind, in my heart, in my soul
Each time I think about reason, my work, losing time
I just think about you
'Cause you're all I ever need
All I ever wanted and more
All I need
You're in my mind in my heart in my soul (you're everything)
And each time I think about reason, my work, losing time
I just think about you
And leave responsibility behind
