When you're rocking back and forth there by the window
And the sun shines through the silver in your hair
I'll think of all the years we've spent together
And of all the good and bad times we've shared

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
But each things we share just makes our love grow stronger
And I love you more than words could ever tell

When the golden years have slowly come upon us
And our children have all married off and gone
You know, sweetheart each day our love grows more exciting
And I love you more as each day passes on

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
And each day as we grow closer to God's calling
I pray He'll call us at the same time
There to dwell

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
But each things we share just makes our love grow stronger
And I love you more than words could ever tell

Yes I love you more than words could ever tell
