Looking back on a photo album of my life
It's the little things that make us smile
That, that, that, that make us smile

Like the very first time that you discovered true love
It's a feeling you can't describe
But it always stays on your mind

Or the first time you hear your song on the radio
That gives you goose bumps all over head to toe or
The time you stayed up all night on the phone and you look down
And you realize she's staring
At the same song as you boo

'Cause that's what gets me sentimental (Sentimental)
That's what life is all about (Yeah, Yeah)
That's what gets me all emotional
More than all the things I can do without (Yeah)
I figured out, that these are the moments that matter, matter

And I figured out, that these are the moments that mean the most to me
'Cause I know I have friends (friends), trust (trust), family (family), and others around me that should be enough and I figured out that these are the moments that matter to me

The one thing that I try cherish when I'm on the road is that I'm never alone
Just look around at sunsets and waterfalls and you know that Gods very close

It's like the first time that I learned my history
Cause my dad looked down into my eyes he broke it down for me
I still remember how my mom asked me how my day had been
When I came home from school and Think that's a sweet memory

'Cause that's what gets me sentimental (Sentimental)
That's what life is all about (Yeah, Yeah)
That's what gets me all emotional
More than all the things I can do without (Yeah)
I figured out, that these are the moments that matter, matter

And I figured out, that these are the moments that mean the most to me
'Cause I know I have friends (friends), trust (trust), family (family), and love around me that should be enough and I figured out that these are the moments that matter to me

Keep the only loved ones close to you
'Cause when it gets tough they'll help you pull through
Don't let anybody take you moments from you
Cause these are the moments that matter in the end

'Cause I figured out, these are the moments that matter, matter
And I figured out, that these are the moments that mean the most to me
'Cause I know I have friends (friends), trust (trust), family (family), and love around me that should be enough and I figured out that these are the moments that matter to me

That's all that matters,
That's all that matters,
That's all that matters,
That's all that matters.
