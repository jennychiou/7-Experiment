Look how the wind carries the seed 
See how the soil supplies what it needs 
The rain falls, the sun shines and a flower breaks free 
And it all works together, why can't we 
And I have seen children at play in the park 
Skin shades of ivory, red, yellow and dark 
Well, my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see 
They were playing together, why can't we 

Why can't we, why can't we 
I can love you and you can love me 
Why can't we, why can't we 
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be 
Why can't we 

I had a dream about a lion and a lamb 
They were playing together and there was peace in the land 
And swords became plowshares 'cause there were no enemies 
And I woke up and wondered, God why can't we 

Why can't we, why can't we 
I can love you and you can love me 
Why can't we, why can't we 
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be 
Why can't we 

Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be 
Why can't we, M-M-M-M 
Why can't we
