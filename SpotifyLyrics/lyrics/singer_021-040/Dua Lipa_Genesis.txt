In the beginning
God created heaven and Earth
But for what it's worth
I think that he might've created you first

Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to
Every day
And every night

I been sick and tired or runnin'
Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry
So sorry!
I'm sorry!
Yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is gettin' serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us

How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again
All over again
No, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition
Tells me that I'm doin' you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

I been sick and tired or runnin'
Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry!
Yeah

I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

You know, I roar like a lion
For you, you know I'll be trying till the sun starts rising

I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
