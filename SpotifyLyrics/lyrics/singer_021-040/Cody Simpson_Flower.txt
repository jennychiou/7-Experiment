I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
But I pick you a flower if you like
I know I'll never be the stars up in your sky
But I'll pick you a flower if you like
She loves me, she loves me not
She says she love me has she forgotten that she loves me
Love me one more time
I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
But I can pick you a flower if you like

'Cause I meet you down by the end of the road
Where the sunset glows and the garden grows
I got one pair of shoes with 20 holes in the toes
And I would walk 20 miles just to get to those blue eyes
If you will smile for me to my surprise I would stay for a while to see what comes next
Or we could take off our clothes and have long conversations in French

I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
But I'll pick you a flower if you like
I know I'll never be the stars up in your sky oh no
But I'll pick you a flower if you like
And she loves me, she loves me not
She says she loves me has she forgotten that she loves me
Love me one more time
I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
But I pick you a flower if you like

Let's go
Roses are red, violets are blue
But it is true I'd be through if I don't have you
So I just chill up on the hill picking daffodils
Making wishes, about you mrs

'Cause I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
But I'll pick you a flower
