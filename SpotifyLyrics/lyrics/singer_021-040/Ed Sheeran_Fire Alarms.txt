The rain wont stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor

What I need to know
Is if you love me and I 
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you call
If you want me when you call

We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call

We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away

We are waving (and what I need to know)
We are waving (is if you love me and I)
We are waving (really need to know)
We are waving (if you need me when you call)
We are waving (what I need to know)
We are waving (is if you love me an I)
We are waving (really need to know)
We are waving (if you need me when you call)

What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call
