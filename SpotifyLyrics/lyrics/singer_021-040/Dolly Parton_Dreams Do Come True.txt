Like the morning sun
His love moved across every inch of my body

And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure

This morning when I opened my eyes
There to my surprise
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream
And so I said a little prayer
And thanked God, that he was there
Oh, this is a dream come true

Dream do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But now I do
Dreams do come true

It was love at first sight
And it was love all night

And the way he made love to me
Fulfilled all my fantasies
Ooh, this is a dream come true

Yes, dreams do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But you're living proof
That dreams do come true

Dreams do come true
And I am so in love with you
