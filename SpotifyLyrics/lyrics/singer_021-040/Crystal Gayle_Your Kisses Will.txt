Sometimes when I get in this mood
And I'm needing you deep down within
Just the touch of your hand
And the smile on your face
Makes me wanna live again

'Cause all I need is you, babe
To love, to love, to feel
And when nothing else can warm me up
I know your kisses will

The days of our lives go by
And what have we both got to show
'Cause we played all the games
And the fact still remains
Your love's the only thing I know

'Cause all I need is you, babe
To love, to love, to feel
And when nothing else can warm me up
I know your kisses will
