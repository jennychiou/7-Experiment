Somone else's arms will hold you 
My darling baby girl 
I'll never get to see the child 
I brought into this world 
Because I made one mistake 
Folks say that I'm bad 
But they just don't understand 
The way I loved your Dad 
Now I thought your Daddy loved me 
I was so sure he did 
And so I gave him all my love 
And he said, we would wed 
But I guess he must have changed his mind 
'Cause he left town one day 
When he found out about you 
He just up and ran away 

In this home so far away from home 
I leave my heart today 
'Cause home is where the heart is 
And with you, my heart will stay 
Because I love you so much 
Why, I can't make you pay 
So I'm doing this for your sake 
I'm giving you away
