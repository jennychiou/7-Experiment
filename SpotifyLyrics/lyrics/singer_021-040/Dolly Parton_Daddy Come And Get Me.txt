In this mental institution, lookin' out through these iron bars 
How could he put me in here, how could he go that far 
Yes I need help but not this kind, he didn't love me from the start 
But it's not my mind that's broken, it's my heart 
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you 
I'm depending on you Daddy, there's nothing I can do 
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need 
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me 

When he said he loved another, I was crazy with jealousy 
That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free 
And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days 
And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way 
Daddy come and get me 

Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you 
I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do 
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need 
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me 

Oh Daddy, come and get me
