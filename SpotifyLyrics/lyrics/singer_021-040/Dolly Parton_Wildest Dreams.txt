Let's drink a toast to what might have been 
To all that we were, but can't be again 
And let's just be thankful we parted as friends 
Here's to the past, let the future begin 

Oh, and here's to you wildest dreams 
And here's to your everything 
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness 
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams 

I made a promise that I wouldn't cry 
You go chase your rainbows, go on reach for the sky 
But come hold me close now, look deep in my eyes 
Tell me you love me, then kiss me goodbye 

Oh, and here's to you wildest dreams 
And here's to your everything 
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness 
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams 
I'll always love you and I'm on your side 
In whatever you do, I will take pride 

Oh, and here's to you wildest dreams 
And here's to your everything 
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness 
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams 

Baby, here's to your wildest dreams 
Dreams, dream on, baby
