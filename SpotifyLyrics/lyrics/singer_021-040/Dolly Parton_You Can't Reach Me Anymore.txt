You can't reach me anymore
You say I'm not the girl that you remember
You say that I hve changed so much and you can't seem to rach me
Well you destroyed everything I used to be before and you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off inside when you would turn me down
Now you want the love from me that you destroyed before
But you can't reach me anymore
Now you say you love me more than anything
I used to love you that way now I don't feel a thing
The love that once lived in my heart don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off when you would turn me down
Love that once lived in my heart it don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore oh oh oh no you can't reach me anymore
