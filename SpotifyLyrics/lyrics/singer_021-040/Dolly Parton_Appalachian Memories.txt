You oughta go north somebody told us 
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust 
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands 
Now I don't recall you said it 
But we'd lived so long on credit 
And so we headed out to find our promised land 
Just poor Appalachian farm folk 
With nothing more than high hopes 
We hitched our station wagon to a star 
But our dreams all fell in on us 
'Cause there was no land of promise 
And it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are 

Oh and these northern nights are dreary 
And my southern heart is weary 
I wonder how the old folks are back home 
But I'll keep leanin' on sweet Jesus 
I know He'll love and guide and lead us 
Appalachian memories keep me strong 

Ya know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately 
About what's been and what awaits me 
It takes all I've got to give what life demands 
You go insane if you give in to it 
Life's a mill and I've been through it 
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands 

Oh and these northern nights are dreary 
And my southern eyes are teary 
Don't I wonder how the old folks are back home 
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus 
I know he'll love and guide and lead us 
Appalachian memories keep me strong 

I'll keep lookin' to the Father 
Keep our heads above the water 
Appalachian memories keep me strong
