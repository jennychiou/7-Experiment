You may not know it
I don't always show it
But you're so important to me
So much that we've shared
You've always been there
I hope you always will be

'Cause you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special to me

When I'm around you
The love that surrounds you
Brings comfort and warmth to my heart
A God-given treasure
You give me such pleasure
You are a true work of art

'Cause you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special to me

Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me

You're the wind 'neath my wings
Like the song that they sing
But there's so many things that you are
An angel in my life
You are the sunlight
And you hung the moon and the stars
Yes, you're special

Yes, you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me


You are something special
MM-MM, you're something special
You are something special
