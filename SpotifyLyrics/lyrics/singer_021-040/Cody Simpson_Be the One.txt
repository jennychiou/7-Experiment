Look around, you should be,
Should be dancing, dance with me
Bottom line, we're wastin time
So I'ma say what's on my mind
I just want you to know,
That you're so so beautiful

(Baby I just want to be with you,
I don't care if nobody approves,
Tell me what I gotta do
To prove tonight, I might be the one, girl
Baby I just want to be with you,
I don't care if nobody approves,
Tell me what I gotta do
To prove tonight, I might be the one, girl)

Though we're caught in the moment,
The moment you know
That you want me to own it, To own it
Let's go...
And I need you to know,
That you're so so beautiful

(Baby I just want to be with you,
I don't care if nobody approves,
Tell me what I gotta do
To prove tonight, I might be the one, girl
Baby I just want to be with you,
I don't care if nobody approves,
Tell me what I gotta do
To prove tonight, I might be the one, girl)

Don't over-think it,
We don't have to leave yet
We're just havin' fun,
What could go wrong
There ain't no question about it
I'm sayin' it's you that I want

(Baby I just want to be with you,
I don't care if nobody approves,
Tell me what I gotta do
To prove tonight, I might be the one, girl
Baby I just want to be with you,
I don't care if nobody approves,
Tell me what I gotta do
To prove tonight, I might be the one, girl)

I might be the one, girl
