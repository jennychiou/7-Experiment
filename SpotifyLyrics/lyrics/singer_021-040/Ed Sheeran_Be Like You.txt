Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you'd breathe me
'Til you're not feeling sure 
Everything will brighten up 
If we go to Brighton I'll take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened I'll make it disappear 

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now

When I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you 

Sunny days
That left my skin blood red
And you squeeze me 
'Til these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
This loves too overrated
See what's going on, on

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now

When I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road
Now I'm missing you
I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too
I thought I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you

And I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress
So I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too
