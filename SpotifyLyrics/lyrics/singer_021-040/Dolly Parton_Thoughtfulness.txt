Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness makes love last much longer

Love is like a tender young flower
It needs care from the time you sow
Tender words of love are like summer showers
Makes love strong when cold winds blow

Thoughtfulness tenderness...

Pull out the weeds of doubt and jealousy give love a chance to grow
Kisses are like sunshine you'll soon see love can bloom even in the snow

Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness thoughtfulness thoughtfulness
