Baby sister what a waste to see you in this place
I lose my mind from worrying over you
In a bar room filled with people all higher than a steeple
But I know why you do the things you do
And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis let's get out of here
'Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home

And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis let's get out of here
'Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home
'Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home
