You walked into the room
Like king of the world
Like you could have your pick
Of all of the girls
There's rumours you've been
Looking all over town
Tryin' to hook someone
For jamming around

I got news for you
This time it is over
Boy I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve
Than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh!
This is my

Absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye
Everytime I take you back
You do me over goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab and
Don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye

I spelled it out
Do you get it now?
I spelled it out
Do you get it now?
I spelled it out
Do you get it now?
Haha ho,
I'm telling you

At first you showered me with
All your attention
Tryin' to do something
I can't even mention
You wanna have your way and
Still kiss the girl
But you are living in a dream world

I got news for you
This time it is over
Boy I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve
Than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh!
This is my

Absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye
Everytime I take you back
You do me over goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab and
Don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye

These games that you're playing
Are played, and I'm saying
No use in wasting
That clever little mouth

You can't kid a kidder
The sweet, taste is bitter
Boy I found you out

I got news for you
This time it is over
Boy I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve
Than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh!
This is my

Absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye
Everytime I take you back
You do me over goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab and
Don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye

Read my lips
