I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special, something that's rare
If you feel the same way when you're lookin' at me
I know there could be a love we could share

Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need
Won't you come and love with me

We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could paint

Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me

Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me
Oh, won't you come and love with me?
