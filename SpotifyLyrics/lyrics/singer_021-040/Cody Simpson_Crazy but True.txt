She gives me love, gives me
Love like all the time
A big heart, pretty smile, 
A beautiful mind
When she walks in the room, 
Man look how she shines
Don't need no spotlight, no fancy design

Yeah, yeah, that's my baby, 
That's, that's my baby
Never wanna leave her you couldn't pay me and I, oh I
I think I finally found a girl
I want to rule my world

It's crazy but true, it's crazy but true
Can't see myself with nobody but you
It's crazy but true, it's crazy but true
She's got that kind of love that keeps me in a good mood

I'm singing, I'm singing
Yeah girl you got me singing, singing

Yeah, always include her in all my plans
She's right behind me like the pocket
On the back of my pants
She knows what I'm thinking before I get the chance
To tell her so I got to thank her in advance
Yeah, yeah, that's my baby, 
That's, that's my baby
Never wanna leave her you couldn't pay me and I, oh I
I think I finally found a girl
I want to rule my world

It's crazy but true, it's crazy but true
Can't see myself with nobody but you
It's crazy but true, it's crazy but true
She's got that kind of love that keeps me in a good mood

I'm singing, I'm singing
Yeah girl you got me singing, singing

All my friends tellin' me that 
I should take my time, take my time
Leave it up to me and I'll be with you
Day and night, rain or shine

Yeah, yeah, that's my baby, 
That's, that's my baby
Never wanna leave her you couldn't pay me and I, oh I
I think I finally found a girl
I want to rule my world

It's crazy but true, it's crazy but true
Can't see myself with nobody but you
It's crazy but true, it's crazy but true
She's got that kind of love that keeps me in a good mood

You got me singing, singing
You got me singing, singing
I think I finally found a girl
I want to rule my world
Yeah, yeah, that's my baby, 
That's, that's my baby
