Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow 
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 

Dry your eyes, don't cry no more 
We'll find a place where there's laughter and joy 
So take my hand and don't let go 
Come with me and together we'll go 

Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow 
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 

We'll walk in the sunshine 
We'll laugh and we'll sing 
And dance to the tune that our happiness brings 
Come go with me to this place I speak of 
Together, we'll find it, this place is called love 

Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow 
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 

Somewhere a river of happiness flows
