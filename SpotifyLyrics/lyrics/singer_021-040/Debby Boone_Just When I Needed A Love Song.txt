I was fresh out of melodies 
All out of pretty rhymes 
Love was just a word I heard in someone else's lines 
But that was before today 
When you looked into my eyes 
Now love's the only melody that's running through my end 

You came along just when I needed a love song 
When all I had was sad songs in my life 
You came along just when I needed a love song 
And honey I want to sing you every night 

I was ready to hang it up 
Words of love had come and gone 
Happy endings always ended someone else's song 
But that was before your touch 
Put all the notes in place 
And now I hear sweet music 
Every time I see your face 

You came along just when I needed a love song 
When all I had was sad songs in my life 
You came along just when I needed a love song 
And honey I want to sing you every night
