You take the darkness out of my night
You've shown your sweet love on me so bright	
I won't be lonely, you fill my heart
My blue days have gone forever
Now we'll never part
Ch: Hello, I love you
Hello, again
You are my sunshine, shine on again
This is the moment, my life one bored/was
Won't you lay with me darling forever?
Stay and keep me warm until the morning light shines
Ch: Hello, I love you
Hello, again
You are my sunshine, shine on again
