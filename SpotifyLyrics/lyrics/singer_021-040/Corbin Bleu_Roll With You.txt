Roll with you, yeah
Roll with you, I wanna roll with you
Roll with you, yeah

It's in your eyes, your smile, the way you walk away
Knowin' that I'm watchin' you
Everything about us I can see
It's just the way I thought that it could be

And when you take my hand
It's like I never wanna stop the way I feel right now
You're gettin' to me like a fever I can't shake
Like I'm dreamin' while I'm wide awake

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky
Steppin' in the city with you, it's locked down
Crazy, I must be crazy
'Cause it feels crazy good

When I roll with you in the night
The music's ragin', the floor is shakin'
Can it get any better than this?
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)

Wanna roll with you by my side
Beats bangin', sensation
Can it get any better than this?
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)

Took a little time for me to find a way
That I could really be myself
Always hangin' out and runnin' with the crowd didn't thrill me
(Do you know what I'm sayin'? I couldn't stick around)

Then you dropped the bomb
Gave me something that nobody ever did before
Kinda like this groove it just feels right
Kinda like the stars light up the night

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky
Steppin' in the city with you, it's locked down
Crazy, I must be crazy
'Cause it feels crazy good

When I roll with you in the night
The music's ragin', the floor is shakin'
Can it get any better than this?
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)

Wanna roll with you by my side
Beats bangin', sensation
Can it get any better than this?
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)

Nothin' better, baby
Than you and me in the glow
You feel the same way
And I like it when you let me know, let me know

Special somethin' I don't know what it is
But I count my blessings
That you're right here with me

I wanna roll with you in the night
The music's ragin', the floor is shakin'
Can it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)

Wanna roll with you by my side
Beats bangin', sensation
Can it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)

Wanna roll with you in the night
The music's ragin', the floor is shakin'
Can it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)

I wanna roll with you by my side
Beats bangin', sensation
Can it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)
Does it get any better than this?
(I don't think so)
