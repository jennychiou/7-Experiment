Hey girl, I wanna give you some friendly advice 

He's got you cryin', oh he's done it again 
He's made a date and he didn't show 
You know he's done this to you so many times 
When you gonna let him go 
He doesn't treat you little a lover should 
He could be so downright cruel 
Can't understand why you're hangin' with him 
Girl, don't you be a fool 

Go on and dump the dude 
You know he's got a rotten attitude 
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood 
Take my advice, don't you think twice 
Listen to what I'm telling you 
Go on and dump the dude 

You know that we've been friends for so many years 
And I've never ever seen you this way 
So torn apart, how he gets to your heart 
With all the little games that he plays 
Just give him up, get him out of your life 
Promise me that once and for all 

You're gonna tell him that it's over and done 
The very next time he calls, ain't you now 

Dump the dude 
You know he's got a rotten attitude 
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood 
Take my advice, find somebody nice 
Listen to what I'm telling you 
Go on and dump the dude 

Girl, I know you may think this is none of my business 
But the fact that we're friends I believe that makes it my business 
I care about you but I ain't preachin' 
I think you should dump the dude 

I don't know why you'd want to settle for less 
When you could have so much more 
You know that you deserve only the best 
So what are you waiting for? 

Go on and dump the dude 
You know he's got a rotten attitude 
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood 
Take my advice, don't you think twice 
Find yourself somebody nice 
Go on and dump the dude
