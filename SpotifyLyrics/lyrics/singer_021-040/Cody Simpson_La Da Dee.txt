There's no way to say this song's about someone else
Every time you're not in my arms
I start to lose myself
Someone please pass me my shades
Don't let 'em see me down
You have taken over my days
So tonight I'm goin' out.


'Cause I'm feeling like
There is no better place
Than right by your side
I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
Cause all the girls are looking fine
But your the only one on my mind


La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you are gone
I'll think of you

All these places packed with people
But your face is all I see
And the music's way too loud
But your voice won't let me be
So many pretty girls around
They're just dressing to impress
But the thought of you alone has
Got me spinning I don't not what to say next
'Cause I'm feeling like
There is no better place
Than right by your side
I had a little taste
I'll only spoil the party anyway
Cause all the girls are looking fine
But your the only one on my mind

La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you are gone
I'll think of you

La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you are gone
I'll think of you

I'll pretend the night is so beautiful
Take a photo with the boss
La da dee
La la da doo
They won't see the mighty skies
Right here behind my eyes
Replyin' in my mind
La da da
I'm feeling like
There is no better place
Than right by your side
I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind


La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you are gone
I'll think of you

La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La da me
La da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you are gone
I'll think of you
