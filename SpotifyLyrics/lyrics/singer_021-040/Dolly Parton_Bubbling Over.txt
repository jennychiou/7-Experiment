You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes 
You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile 
You're the one that puts the meaning in my life 
And I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over 
Because you are mine 
Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring 
Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing 

And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see 
That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over 
Because you love me 

I have never known a love that felt like this 
You're the one I want to share my lovin' with 
Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness 
Keeps me bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over with happiness 

Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring 
Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing 
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see 
That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over 
Because you love me 

Yes, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over 
'Cause you love me
