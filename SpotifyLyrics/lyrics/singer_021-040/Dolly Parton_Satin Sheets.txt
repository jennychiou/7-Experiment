Satin sheets to lie on 
Satin pillows to cry on 
Still I'm not happy don't you see 
Big long Cadillacs, tailor maids upon my back 
Still I want you to set me free 

I've found another man 
Who can give more than you can 
Though you've given me everything that money can buy 
But your money can't hold me tight 
Like he does on a long long night 
No, you didn't keep me satisfied 

Satin sheets to lie on 
Satin pillows to cry on 
Still I'm not happy don't you see 
Big long Cadillacs, tailor maids upon my back 
Still I want you to set me free

Satin sheets to lie on 
Satin pillows to cry on 
Still I'm not happy don't you see 
Big long Cadillacs, tailor maids upon my back 
Still I want you to set me free
