A new beginning
A new chapter of my life
Started the day
When I thought
It could be my last
My eyes were wide shut but I
I hadn't given up
Just thought I'd be working
The world alone

Out of the blue
And there I met you
Showed me a life
I can't see without you
And there's just no way
That I can fight these emotions
Your energy running through me
Nobody carried through me like you
Out of the blue
Can this be true?

Family and friends they were my life
I was the one for butterflies
You give me love that I can't disguise,
And there will be times when we're apart
I want you to know you're in my heart
Growing into a beautiful garden

No emotions
My whole body felt like ice
Needed to feel
That the sun will shine my away
My world had turned to dust but I
I had my faith in trust
Just though I'd be working
The world alone

Family and friends they were my life
I was the one for butterflies
You give me love that I can't disguise,
And there will be times when we're apart
I want you to know you're in my heart
Growing into a beautiful garden

Out of the blue
There I met you
I can't believe that this happened so soon
There's just no way
That I can fight these emotions
Your energy running through me
(Out of the blue, there I met you, showed me a life)
I can't see without you, without you, there I met you, you
(Out of the blue, there I met you, showed me a life)
I can't see without you

There will be times when we're apart
I want you to know you're in my heart
Growing into a beautiful garden
(Out of the blue)
(Out of the blue, there I met you, showed me a life)
I can't see without you
(There will be times when we're apart)
(I want you to know you're in my heart)
(Growing into a beautiful garden)
(Out of the blue)
(There I met you)
(Showed me a life I can't see without you)
