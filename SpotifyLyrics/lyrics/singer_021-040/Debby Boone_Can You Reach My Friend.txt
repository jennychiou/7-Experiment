I got a call from an old friend
We laughed about how things had changed
But I could tell things weren't going
As well as he claimed

He tried to hide his feelings
But they only gave him away
The longer I listened,
The more I kept wishing that
I knew the right words to say

Can You reach my friend?
Bring his searching to an end
Lord, I know you love him
Help him understand
Can You reach my friend?
You're the only One who can
Help him give his heart to You

We talked for more than an hour
I smiled when he mentioned Your name
I said that I knew You

I told him the difference You made
But he never thought he would need You
But maybe he's changing his mind
As we said goodbye Lord
He told me that I ad found
Something that he'd like to find

Can You reach my friend?
You're the only One who can
Lord, I know You love him
Help him understand
Can you reach my friend?
Bring his searching to an end
Help him give his heart to You

Maybe he's ready tonight
Lord, he said that he might
Need to call You

Help him give his heart to You
