"'Demi Lovato:"'
I love the way you talkin', I'm lovin' what you're doin', boy
I don't fall easy often, I never had a love like you before
I like you, put your number, put your number
In my phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, yeah
You heard me right, so call me, call me
When you're all alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone

Don't make plans
Come on with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you and I want you bad
Let's keep the party goin' all night long
Let's keep the party goin' all night long
All night long, all night long
All night, all night, all night long, all night long
All night, all night, a-a-a-all night

I'm on another planet, I'm in another universe
You may not understand it, sooner or later, baby, you will learn
I like you, put your number, put your number
In my phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, yeah
You heard me right, so call me, call me
When you're all alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone

Don't make plans
Come on with me, we'll stay up all night long

"'Missy Elliott:"'
We could party all night, night, wanna spend a night, night
Will you be my type by the end of the night we could pillow fight
Your Missy's real nice, come closer 'cause I don't bite
You talkin' how I like, you play daddy, I play wife
I-I'm so alone, no-no one is home
I got your, got your n-n-number in my telephone
Wanna wanna wanna be your girl, wanna wanna wanna be my man
Boy, we could hold hands write our names in the sand
It's the weekend, don't make plans
