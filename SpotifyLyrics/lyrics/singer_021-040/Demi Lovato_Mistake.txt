Now that I'm thinking sober, don't you try get no closer
I just gonna get my car and drive, and drive
Looking in the rear view mirror, everything is so much clearer
Watch me wave it all goodbye, goodbye

The lights flashing givin' me all the danger signs
Someone to save, to save
But it don't work that way

Think you've made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be takin' your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written in your face you know you made it
Your greatest mistake

When the last straw is broken, when the last door is closin'
I ain't that dumb to stick around, stick around
I ain't got the time for lookin' back, when ya let yourself slip through the cracks
And you just keep going down, down, down

I'm a stay undercover, lay low need some time
No one to save, to save
This sick cycle's overplayed

Think you've made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be takin' your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written in your face you know you made it
Your greatest mistake

Why you lookin' at me spittin' the same old line?
Tryin' to creep back ain't no flippin' my mind
Don't you get it by now the story's over, over
Still callin' my name outside my house
I'm hittin' the switch watch the lights go out
Watch the lights go out

I hope you ache, ache, ache oh, oh
I hope you ache, ache, ache oh, oh

Think you've made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be takin' your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written in your face you know you made it
Your greatest mistake
