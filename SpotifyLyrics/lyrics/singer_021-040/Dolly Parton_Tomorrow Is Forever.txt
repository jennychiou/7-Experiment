Take my hand and run with me
Out of the past of yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot
No looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow

Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever

No more crying tears leave tracks
And mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together

Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever

I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never

Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
