I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you
Gave you every bit of my time
Gave you everything I could possibly give you
My body, my heart, and my mind
I turned my family and good friends against me
Listened to my own heart break
And I did it all in the name of love
Gave up myself for your sake

And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears

You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me
Over and over again
You promised to love me forever
But forever reached a bitter sweet end

Been blinded by love to your actions
But at last I can see my way clear
I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried
But you, you've never shed one tear

'Cause you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears

You ain't worth, you ain't worth the salt in my tears
Treated like dirt, I'm hurt, I ain't hangin' 'round here
You've left me crying, left me crying for years
But you ain't worth the salt in my tears

You never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
No you ain't worth the salt in my tears
