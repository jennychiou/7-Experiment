When I sing for him oh praise God's holy name I can feel his presence in my soul
When I sing for him oh blessed be his name how I rejoice within when I sing for him
As I sing a melody that he gave when I speak God's name in song or kneel to pray
Oh I have a special feeling deep within when I sing for him
When I sing for him in person hallelujah when I look to my new home hallelujah
Oh the angels will be singing hallelujah amen when I sing for him when I sing for him
