The hardest thing I've ever done or that I'll ever do
Was to just walk off and leave you but I knew I had to leave you
'Cause I couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
The worst pain that I've ever known or that I'll ever know
Was to see your love a dying and to have to watch it dying
And I couldn't stand to watch you falling out of love with me
It's hurtin' now but still it's better I left while love was still alive
It was dying and I'd rather I didn't have to watch it die
The deepest hurt I've ever felt or that I'll ever feel
Was to know that I was losing and I tried but I kept losing
And I couldn't stay to watch you falling out of love with me
The loneliest I've ever been or that I'll ever be
Is now that I'm without you and I feel so lost without you
But I couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
I'm crying now but still it's better I left while love was still alive
But it was dying and I'd rather I didn't have to watch it die
