I never knew what this could do 
Seeing another woman with you 
But I can't stay here 
'Cause I would never get over you 
Baby that'll never do 
I gotta get loose 
Somebody take me out of this place 
Keep my eyes from seeing your face 
'Cause you love her the way you once loved me 
Darling I can't believe it's true oh no 

It's not my affair anymore 
You're not my man to care for 
It's not my affair anymore 

I'll close the door 

So many things we've left unsaid 
So many questions in my head 
Well I never lock the back door 
Ooh and somehow you keep slipping on in 
Taking me back once again 
To a memory trail like a shadow 
From a feelin' and it just grows don't I know 

It's not my affair anymore 
You're not my man to care for 
It's not my affair anymore 

Remember, all of the laughter 
Remember, ooh the morning after 
Remember, the moonlight, the candle light, the shady light 
Remember, and it seemed so right 

It's not my affair anymore 
You're not my man to care for 
It's not my affair anymore 

Remember, the moonlight, the candle light, the shady light 
Remember, ooh and it seemed so right 

It's not my affair anymore 
You're not my man to care for 
It's not my affair anymore 

It's not my affair anymore 
It's not my affair anymore 
It's not my affair anymore 
It's not my affair anymore
