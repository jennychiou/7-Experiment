Don't look so sad I know it's over 
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning 
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together 
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning 

Lay your head upon my pillow 
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine 
Hear the whisper of the rain drops 
Blowing soft against the window 
And make believe you love me one more time 
For the good times 

I'll get along and you'll find another 
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need 
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever 
They'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me 

Lay your head upon my pillow 
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine 
Hear the whisper of the rain drops 
Blowing soft against the window 
And make believe you love me one more time 
For the good times 

For the good times 
For the good times
