My baby makes me proud 
Lord, don't he make me proud 
He never makes a scene 
Hangin' all over me in a crowd 
'Cause people like to talk 
Lord, don't they love to talk 
But when they turn out the lights 
I know he'll be leavin' with me 

And when we get behind closed doors 
Then we let out hair hang down 
Then he makes me glad that he's my man 
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors 

My baby makes me smile 
Lord, don't he make me smile 
I'm never far away 
Or too tired to say I want to 
I'm purring like a kitten 
When e's out in public with me 
But when they turn out the lights 
He brings out the tiger in me 

And when we get behind closed doors 
Then we let out hair hang down 
Then he makes me glad that he's my man 
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  

Behind closed doors
