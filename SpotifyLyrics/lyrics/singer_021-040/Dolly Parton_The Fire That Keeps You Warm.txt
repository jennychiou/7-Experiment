Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm

Let me be the someone that you need
Let me be the shelter that you seek
Let me be your strength when you are weak
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm

Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm

Let me be the one always around
Let me help you up when you are down
Let me make a smile out of a frown
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm

Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm

Let me be the fire that keeps you warm
