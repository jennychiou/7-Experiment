The bridge, so high 
The bridge, so tall 
Here is where it started 
On the bridge 
The moon is big and yellow 
And the stars are all a' glow 
From the bridge, I see reflections 
In the waters far below 

You kissed me for the first time here 
An' held me awfully tight 
And the bridge became our favorite place 
We came here often in the night 

And one night while standing on the bridge 
Desire swept through us both 
Passion took us by the hand 
And showed us where to go 

From the bridge we saw a meadow 
So we ran together there 
Where we found love together 
Our emotions filled the air 

The bridge, so wide 
The bridge, so long 
Where once we stood together 
Tonight I stand alone 

Tonight, while standing on the bridge 
My heart is beating wild 
To think that you could leave me here 
With our unborn child 

My feet are moving slowly 
Closer to the edge 
Here is where it started 
And here is where I'll end it...
