Ooh, the way that you dance on me makes me not wanna leave
You wanna go upstairs but you don't wanna sleep
All right now, we're in the rhythm
Your boyfriend's no competition
Turn off your phone and blame it on your battery
Hey!

Oh oh oh oh, we're gettin' real real close
Oh oh oh oh, can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you
And these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna, let me take it to another room
So it's only us
Turn that television up
So nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you
And these empty cups

Ooh, girl do you think they'll notice if we slip away
Maybe tomorrow they'll all have something to say
All right now, we're in the rhythm
We don't need no one's permission
End of the night don't mean we gotta separate, whoa

Oh oh oh oh, we're gettin' real real close
Oh oh oh oh, can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you (me and you)
And these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna, let me take it to another room (another room)
So it's only us
Turn that television up
So nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you (me and you)
And these empty cups

All of these empty cups, baby
All of these empty cups

Oh oh oh oh, we're gettin' real real close
Oh oh oh oh, can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you (me and you)
And these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna, let me take it to another room (another room)
So it's only us
Turn that television up
So nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you (me and you)
And these empty cups

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you
And these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna, let me take it to another room (oh baby)
Like it's only us
Turn that television up
So nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you
And these empty cups
