Hurt is no stranger to me and oh how well I know misery
You always hurt me but I always forgive and I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply I give you my love completely
I give you love but hurt is all you give and I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
For as long as I love you there'll be pain
Though tears come and go my love remains the same
I'll always forgive you yes you know that I will and I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Yes I'll hurt for as long as I love you and I'll love you for as long as I live
