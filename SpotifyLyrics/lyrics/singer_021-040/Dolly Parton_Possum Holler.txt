About possum in Possum Holler

As a young man I'd go a courtin'
With my sweetheart so young and fair
Down the mountain to Possum Holler
That's where he'd always find me waitin' there

Now I tell my mama that I's goin' out walking
Neath the moonlight so bright and fair
And I'd tell daddy I was huntin' possum
And take off a grinnin' and a slickin' down my hair

Then one evening in Possum Holler
My sweetheart's daddy stopped all our fun
Yeah we got married in Possum Holler
Just you and me my daddy and daddy's gun

Now when they see a possum hunter
Young and handsome and a smellin' fair
We just lean back and bust our laughin'
'Cause we know there ain't no possum there
