The work is hard and the hours are long 
The money ain't much but we get along 
We're rich in things can give 
That can't be bought with a dollar bill 
So, come on down 
Have a look around 
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town 
We got no money but we're rich in love 
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of 
So come on down have a look around 
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town 

We got no carpets on the floor 
We've got wall to wall love 
Who could ask for more 
We got no big fine things to show 
Just a place to watch our children grow 

We got no big fine fancy car to drive 
And no fancy clothes to keep in style 
What we've got we're payin' on 
But it's mostly love that we're livin' on 

So, come on down 
Have a look around 
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town 
We got no money but we're rich in love 
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of 
So come on down have a look around 
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town 

We've got a little simple church nearby 
And the promise of a mansion in the sky 
A heart of gold a million dollar smile 
And a one way ticket to paradise 

So, come on down 
Have a look around 
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town 
We got no money but we're rich in love 
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of 
So come on down have a look around 
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town 

So, come on down 
Have a look around 
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town 
We got no money but we're rich in love 
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of 
So come on down have a look around 
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
