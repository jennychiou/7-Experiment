Here we are again going in this cheap place
What if was seen by a friend and they recognize our face
We both know that it's wrong we both should be at home
This time has gotta be our last time

I know that you want me just as much as I want you
You've got a family and I've got one too
From now on we must stay apart we just can't break all their hearts
This time has gotta be our last time

This time has gotta be our last time
We'll put our rings back on our hands
Your conscience hurt you well mine does too
I'm not this kind of woman and I'm not this kind of man
We just can't go on cheating neither of us is this kind
This time has gotta be our last time
This time has gotta be our last time
