Could I wake up next to you
When we're hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And now I'm sitting on a night bus
Flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired 
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on

Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
But I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my food for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
