Randy in your eyes, I see the promise of a future 
The promise of a love like I have never known 
Randy, cradled in your arms, I feel like I'm in heaven 
And heaven knows I've needed someone like you for so long 
So Randy take me with you, for that's where I want to be 
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me 
Randy, let me show you what your love has meant to me 
Randy, let me be the only one you'll ever need 

Randy, you have given me reason to live again 
Reason to love again and reason to smile 
Randy, you have given me new inspiration 
New dreams to dream and a reason to try 

So Randy take me with you for that's where I want to be 
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me 
Randy, let me show you what your love has meant to me 
Randy, let me be the only one you'll ever need
