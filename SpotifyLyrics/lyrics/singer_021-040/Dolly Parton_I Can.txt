I can lose myself in the beauty of a song
I can climb to the top of a cloud in the sky
I can soar through the heavens like a graceful eagle
I can swing from the wings of a butterfly

I can chase the wind down the canyons of my mind
I can catch it in the corner of my memory
I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died
And I can stand and reminisce a while

In my mind I can be anything I want to be
In my mind I can do anything I want to do
Except make my mind forget you

I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow
I can go there and back and never leave my room
I can change a heartache into a tiny snowflake
And I can take December and turn it into June

In my mind I can be anything I want to be...
