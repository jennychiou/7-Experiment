He is high and mighty
He is high and mighty
He is there in everyway
Reaching out to you and me

He is High and Mighty
Mighty is his power, mighty is his love
He is High and Mi-ight-ty
He is there with the answers, let us lift him up

God loves ya, did ya know that? Ain't it good to know he cares?
If you're burdened down with troubles, just go to him in prayers
Say,"God, I'm just a seeker. I'm empty, scared, and lost."
Then lay your burdens down at the foot of the cross

He said "Yeah shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free".
He will guide and lead you, and fulfill every need
Nothing is impossible if you have faith enough
So if you've lost direction, stop and just look up 'cause...

He is high, and mighty
Ooh mighty is his power, mighty is his love
He is high, and Mi-ight-ty
He is life everlasting, let us lift him up

High and Mighty
He is High, and Mighty
I believe, I do believe
That his love has set me free

I believe, I believe, I believe
He is high and mighty
Oh, mighty is his power, mighty is his love
He is high and he is Mi-ight-ty
It is a wonderful feeling, let us lift him up

He said if I (he said if i), be lifted up (be lifted up)
He said if I be lifted up
What did he say?
(He said if i) he said if i, (be lifted up) be lifted up
I'll grow old and on to me

Let's lift him higher (higher), higher (higher), higher and higher each day
Let's lift him up 'cause he is high and he is mi-ight-ty

And he has washed my sins away
'Cause he is high and he is mighty
