A different lover ev'ry day 
Same old book just a diff'rent page 
Same old lines in the same old play 
I've got to find somebody I can love all the way 
I wanna fall in love, someone that I can live with 
I wanna fall in love, someone to take and give with 
I wanna fall in love, someone I can be real with 
I wanna fall in love 

I want someone to be just mine 
Someone to be with all the time 
A real true love is hard to find 
And I don't know where I'll find him 
But I've got to keep on tryin' cause 

I wanna fall in love, if you hear me, listen to me 
I wanna fall in love, I'm undone so come and do me 
I wanna fall in love, if you got love, give it to me 

Love, I wanna fall in love, someone to really need me 
I wanna fall in love, someone to really please me 
I wanna fall in love, when it hurts, someone to ease me 
I wanna fall in love 
I wanna fall in love, someone to spend my life with 
I wanna fall in love, someone to fuss and fight with 
I wanna fall in love, someone to make it right with 
I wanna fall in love
