"Dolly Parton - Spoken:"
Patsy, what're you looking so down about?

Got a feeling 'cause I'm blue
Oh, Lord, since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna to do
All I do is sit and cry

Oh, Lord, that life-long day he said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
He'll do ya, he'll do me
He's got that kind of lovin'
And, Lord, I love to hear him when he calls me "sweet baby"

What a beautiful ring
I hate to think it all over
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to that man somehow
That I know 'body should be better than that
'Cause I'm lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues

Now I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
That's what's a' matter with me
When I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
But he don't care about me

When I tried and tried to keep you satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
But now that he is leavin'
This is all I've got to say

I've got a feeling 'cause I'm blue
Oh, Lord, since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm going to do
I lost my heart it seems
I have grown so used to that man somehow
And I know 'body should be better than that
'Cause I'm lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues

(Oh, come on, Hefty, let's play one! Good Lord, that's Sole Kramer! He's older than we are!)

I have grown so used to that man somehow
And I know 'body should be better than that
'Cause I'm lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues
