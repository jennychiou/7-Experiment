You hurt me, you use me, you lie 
You're heartless and hateful and cold 
You don't care how you make me cry 
You must have the last word 
And be in control 
What is it about you I love 
You're selfish and stubborn and proud 
You're arrogant, boastful and vain 
You're careless and thoughtless and loud 
A flirt and a tease 
And you cause me such pain 
What is it about you I love 
What is it, what is it my love 

There's something about you 
That I seem to need 
I have a hunger you know how to feed 
And you satisfy me like nobody else 
Those moments of heaven 
Are worth all this hell 

And I know you love me in your own crazy way 
And I know you need me more than you can say 
I may be a fool but I'll never give up 
'Cause there's something about you I love 
What is it, what is it my love 

And there's something about me 
That you seem to need 
'Cause you have a hunger I know how to feed 
And I satisfy you like nobody else 
Those moments of heaven 
Are worth all this hell 

And I know in my heart that you want to be good 
I understand that you're misunderstood 
You're insecure and defensively tough 
There's something about you my love 
What is it, what is it my love 
There's something about you 
That I seem to need 
What is it, what is it my love
