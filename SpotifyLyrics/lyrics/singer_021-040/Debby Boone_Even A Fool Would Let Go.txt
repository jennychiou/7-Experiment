It's funny how love goes
'Cause I know this will never work out
But honey my love grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt

This can never be
I keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on

When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows there is no use in trying
Even a child would say no
'Cause he knows that he'll end up crying

Tell me now
Is it worse holding you
When even a fool would let go

My love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love's got no season
I just know that it's there all the time

Baby just you and me
Even if its wrong
Thinking about you and me
Makes me want to hold on

When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows there is no use in trying
Even a child would say no
'Cause he knows that he'll end up crying

Tell me now
Is it worse holding you
When even a fool would let go
Tell me now
Is it worse holding you
When even a fool would let go
