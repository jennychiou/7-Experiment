Nothing new, nothing different, nothing better, nothing more 
Nothing else to give you I didn't give before 
I gave my love completely, my heart was always yours 
It wouldn't do, I still lost you 
You want to give it one chance; Don't know why we should 
We'd never get that far again or make the love that good 
We had our chance, we blew it; And I'll never understand 
Careless fools, I still lost you 
You want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire 
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires 
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare 
I refuse, I still lost you 

Too late for starting over, it hardly ever works 
Too many missing pieces, too much water, too much hurt 
I already lost you once, and that makes matters worse 
What's the use, I still lost you 

Oh you want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire 
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires 
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare 
I refuse, I still lost you 

Oh what's the use, I still lost you 
I lost you
