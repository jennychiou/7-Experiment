Say forever you'll be mine

Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine

Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day

Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to

Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
