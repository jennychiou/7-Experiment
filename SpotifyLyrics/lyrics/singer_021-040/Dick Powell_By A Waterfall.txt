I appreciate the simple things
'Cause I'm awfully fond of getting
Love in an actual setting
This is what I call the simple things
Just a winding stream where I can drift and dream
And now I'm waiting for you

By a waterfall I'm calling you
We can share it all beneath a ceiling of blue
We'll spend a heavenly day
Here where the whispering waters play

There's a whip-poor-will that's calling you
By a waterfall, he's dreaming too
There's a magic melody
Mother nature sings to me
Beside a waterfall with you

There's a whip-poor-will that's calling
By a waterfall, he's dreaming too
There's a magic melody
Mother nature sings to me
Besides a waterfall with you
