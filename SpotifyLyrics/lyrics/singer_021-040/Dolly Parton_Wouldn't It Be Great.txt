Wouldn't it be fine if you could say you love me just one time?
Would so be mine, wouldn't that be fine?
Now wouldn't that be fine?
Wouldn't it be great
If you could love me first, let the bottle wait?
Wouldn't that be great?
Now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't that be great
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't that be great
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

In the name of love what's a man so great
Keep thinking of, what a man he was
In the name of love
In the name of love

Love went to waste
When the sexy lace wouldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place
Love went to waste

Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't that be great
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't that be great
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be good and I know you could if you just would
Wouldn't that be good and you know he should

Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't that be great
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't that be great
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Lord, it's for our sake
Now wouldn't that be great?
