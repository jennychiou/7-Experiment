You come to me with teardrops in your eyes 
Expecting me to listen to your lies 
You want me to forget and to forgive 
Enough, enough, this ain't no way to live 
I know you wonder why I'd leave like this 
After all the hurt I've put up with 
This is the last time, this is the last straw 
Too late, too late now it's your time to crawl 

She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart 
It's not her fault, it's yours we fell apart 
No more, I'm done, I want a brand new start 
(It's) She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart 

I've been grasping at straws for much too long 
This ain't the first time you have done me wrong 
This time you drew the short end of the straw 
The game is over, you have lost it all 

She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart 
It's not her fault, it's yours we fell apart 
No more, I'm done, I want a brand new start 
(It's) She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart

She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart
