When you're out there on your own
Trying to make it all alone
'Cause you seek the missing pieces of your life

It's a rough and tumble journey
On a road that never ends
It's a cold, cold world you're walking through, my friend

But when you're loved, when you're loved
You always walk in love's reflection
When you're loved, when you're loved
Some how you find the right direction

This crazy jigsaw puzzle life
With all its pain and all its strife
Becomes a beautiful scene, but I mean,
Only when you're loved

There's a time you start to doubt
You say what's it all about
And you'd like to throw those fading dreams away

'Cause the road keeps leading nowhere
Empty days and endless nights
With that happy journey's end so far from sight

But when you're loved, when you're loved
There's no a storm you cannot weather
And when you're loved, when you're loved
The missing parts all fit together

This crazy jigsaw puzzle life
With all its pain and all its strife
Becomes a beautiful scene, but I mean,
Only when you're loved
