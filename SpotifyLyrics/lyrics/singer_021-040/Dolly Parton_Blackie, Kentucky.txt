In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky 
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day 
And I considered myself as lucky 
When he told me he would take me away 
And though he was older, it made me no difference 
His promise of riches was all I could see 
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky 
And know something better than sad poverty 

Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you 
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see 
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin' 
But I'll always hold you in my memory 

But I've never adjusted to sociable livin' 
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me 
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky 
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me 

He won't let my family and friends come to visit 
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed 
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them 
All that's changed about me is my name 

Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you 
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore 
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy 
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before 

My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky 
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win 
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me 
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again 

An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it 
It's my last request and he can't refuse me 
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky 
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me 

Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you 
But different from the way you remember me before 
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest 
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore 
I'll sleep in your arms forever more
