If you're trying to reach Heaven
You talk to Jesus, you talk to Him every day
'Cause Jesus knows, He knows that you are coming
And Heaven's just a prayer away

Now if you go, if you go to church on Sunday
You get down on your knees and pray
And give your heart and your soul to Jesus
Heaven's just a prayer away

You are just one prayer from Heaven
As you travel down life's highway
Just when you think oh that you can't make it
Well Heaven's just a prayer away

Oh, if you go, if you go to church on Sunday
You get down on your knees and pray
And give your heart and give your soul to Jesus
Heaven's just, yeah Heaven's just a prayer away
Heaven's just, Heaven's just a prayer away
Away...
