Tracing our fingers from right to left
We're too drunk to even walk
And all of a sudden you bring up our problems
So I guess you wanna talk
'Cause they say the bigger the love, the harder the fall
Well, I'm crashing through the floor

Said you're leaving
When the morning comes
All packed up

If the feeling's gone
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me
Just keep on holding on
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me

All our memories are packed into boxes
Stacked up against the door
'Cause they say the bigger the love, the harder the fall
Well, I'm crashing through the floor

I still feel your breath on my lips
As you're walking out the door
But my hand starts to slip
Never felt like this before

If the feeling's gone
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me
Just keep on holding on
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me

I've been looking in the mirror
Trying to figure myself out
I've been wondering where I went wrong
But now you're not here
It's like the daylight never comes
So I'll keep on holding on

Said you're leaving
When the morning comes
All packed up

If the feeling's gone
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me
Just keep on holding on
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me
If the feeling's gone
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me
If the feeling's gone
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me
