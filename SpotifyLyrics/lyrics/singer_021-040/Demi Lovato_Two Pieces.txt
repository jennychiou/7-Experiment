There's a boy, lost his way
Looking for someone to play
There's a girl in the window
Tears rolling down her face

We're only lost children
Trying to find a friend
Trying to find our way back home

We don't know where to go
So I'll just get lost with you
We'll never fall apart
'Cause we fit together right
We fit together right

These dark clouds over me
Rain down and roll away
We'll never fall apart
'Cause we fit together like
Two pieces of a broken heart

I know where we could go
And never feel let down again
We could build sandcastles
I'll be the queen, you'll be my king

We're only lost children
Trying to find a friend
Trying to find our way back home

We don't know where to go
So I'll just get lost with you
We'll never fall apart
'Cause we fit together right
We fit together right

These dark clouds over me
Rain down and roll away
We'll never fall apart
'Cause we fit together like
Two pieces of a broken heart

Now I can lay my head down
And fall asleep
Oh, but I don't have to fall asleep
To see my dreams
'Cause you're right there in front of me
Right there in front of me

There's a boy, lost his way
Looking for someone to play

We don't know where to go
So I'll just get lost with you
We'll never fall apart
'Cause we fit together right
We fit together right

These dark clouds over me
Rain down and roll away
We'll never fall apart
'Cause we fit together like
We fit together like
Two pieces of a broken heart

There's a boy, lost his way
Looking for someone to play
