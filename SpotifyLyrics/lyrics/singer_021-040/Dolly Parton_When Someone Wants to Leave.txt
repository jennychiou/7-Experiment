When you love somebody with all your heart and soul 
And you want to keep them with you, but you know they want to go 
What do you do, what do you say 
When you know they want to leave 
As bad as you want them to stay 

And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love 
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much 
It's a sad situation, I must say 
When you know they want to leave 
As bad as you want them to stay 

You know how much I love you 
But I know you don't love me 
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave 
But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away 
But I know you want to leave 
As bad as I want you to stay 

And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love 
When one doesn't love at all and the other loves too much 
It's a sad situation I must say 
When someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay 
Oh, it's a sad situation I must say 
When someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay
