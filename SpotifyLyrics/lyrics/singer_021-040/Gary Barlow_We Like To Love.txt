Standing here without you I've got nothing to say
Seems my guardian angel had the day off today
Someone ahead of me is calling out my name
Without you I can't stay

Standing at the gates they asked me what did I learn
So glad I got this far and still my soul hasn't burned
Feels like I've run a race but haven't even moved
Without you it's so cold
But without you I now know

Love is for the inspirational
Love is for the supernatural
All this time we spend on earth and just give it away
Love is for the conversational
Love is for the two dimensional
Love is for the common people so give it a try
'Cause we like to love we like to love till we cry
Yeah we like to love we like to love till we die

Standing here so bare with no possessions to hide
Not too early or too late just got here in time
What feels so dangerous is this view is so sublime
Without you I'm right here
Without you I can't hear

Love is for the inspirational
Love is for the supernatural
All this time we spend on earth and just give it away
Love is for the conversational
Love is for the two dimensional
Love is for the common people so give it a try
'Cause we like to love we like to love till we cry
Yeah we like to love we like to love till we die

Now with retrospect and reason
I can see life's one true meaning
Love me, Love me
There's no future in the final act
So I sit looking back to when you loved me
You loved me
We like to love

Love is for the inspirational
Love is for the supernatural
All this time we spend on earth and just give it away
Love is for the conversational
Love is for the two dimensional
Love is for the common people so give it a try
'Cause we like to love we like to love till we cry
Yeah we like to love we like to love till we die

We like to love we like to love till we die
