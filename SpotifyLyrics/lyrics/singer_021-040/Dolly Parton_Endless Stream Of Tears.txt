I cry awake at night and hug my pillow 
And pray that I will die before I wake 
No such luck 
Another day of cryin' 
Don't know how much more my old heart can break 

Flooded with these memories and emotions 
The tears like rain keep on falling down 
They say that I'll forget 
But my face is just as wet 
As it was the day you left this town 

Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 
It's relentless and I'm defenseless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 

I can't believe that I can talk about it 
I never thought I'd live to see this day 
But a broken heart won't kill you 
You just want to die 
But you have to go on livin' anyway 
I feel it through and through 
And I've never been so blue 
And I cried a river over you 

Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 
It's relentless and I'm defenseless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 

Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in this endless stream of tears
