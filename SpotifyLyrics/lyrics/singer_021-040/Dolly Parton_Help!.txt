Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, I need somebody
Please, please, help me

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way 
But now those days are gone and I'm not so self-assured 
Now I find I've changed my mind and I've opened up the door 

Help me if you can, I'm feelin' down 
And I do appreciate you bein' 'round 
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground 
Won't you please, please help me 

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways 
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze 
But every now and then, I feel so insecure 
I know that I just need you like I've never done before 

Help me if you can, I'm feelin' down 
And I do appreciate you bein' 'round 
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground 
Won't you please, please help me 
Help me, help me, ooh
