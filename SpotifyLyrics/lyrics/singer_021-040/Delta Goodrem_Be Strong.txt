Are you swimming upstream, in notions of blue?
Do you feel like you're sinking?
Are you sick of the rain, after all you've been through
Well I know what you're thinking.
When you can't take it, you can make it
Sometime soon I know you will see,

'Cause when you're in your darkest hour,
And all of the light just fades away.
And when you're like a single flower,
Whose colours have turned to shades of grey,
Well hang on
Be strong.

You're taking each step one day at a time,
You can't lose your spirit.
Well let live and let live,
Forget and forgive,
And it's all how you see it.
And just remember, keep it together
Don't you know you're never alone?

'Cause when you're in your darkest hour,
And all of the light just fades away.
And when you're like a single flower,
Whose colours have turned to shades of grey,
Well hang on
Be strong.

No you're not defeated oh
And soon you'll be smiling once again.
Then you won't have to feel it,
Let it go with the wind.
Time passes us by, and know that you're allowed to cry

'Cause when you're in your darkest hour,
And all of the light just fades away.
And when you're like a single flower,
Whose colours have turned to shades of grey,
Well hang on
Be strong.

Oh whoa huuh
Hang on
Hang on
Be strong
Da da da dn dada da
Hold on and be strong.
