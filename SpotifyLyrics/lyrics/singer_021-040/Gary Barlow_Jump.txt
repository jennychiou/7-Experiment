Do you sometimes feel your life is leaving you behind?
With one eye closed, half a world unknown
You want to wave for help but both your hands are tied
You want to start again but you're just too scared

So if you wanna find out, just go ahead and try now
If the thought is terrifying
The risk is really frightening
And your only fear is falling
You should leave without a warning and...

Jump, fly
Let your feet leave the ground, step into the sky and...
Jump, high
If you want a better view, then another life is calling you to

Go ahead and try now
Or how you gonna find out
If life has got predictable
Go on do something wonderful
The first step is the hardest
You'll be safe without a harness so jump
Jump...

You never stand to win if you're not in the race
When voices cheer, you'll be far from here
And maybe once or twice you'll fall flat on your face
But when you move on you'll be twice as strong

Go out on a limb now
Throw caution to the wind now
If the thought is terrifying
The risk is really frightening
And your only fear is falling
You should leave without a warning and...

Jump, fly
Let your feet leave the ground, step into the sky and...
Jump, high
If you want a better view, then another life is calling you to

Go ahead and try now
Or how you gonna find out
If life has got predictable
Go on do something wonderful
The first step is the hardest
You'll be safe without a harness so jump
Jump...

Make up your mind
You'll be just in time
Jump, Jump
If the thought is terrifying
The risk is really frightening
There's no need to play it safe
Just take a leap and fall
You should leave without a warning and...

Jump, fly
Let your feet leave the ground, step into the sky and...
Jump, high
If you want a better view, then another life is calling you to

Go ahead and try now
Or how you gonna find out
If life has got predictable
Go on do something wonderful
The first step is the hardest
You'll be safe without a harness so jump
Jump...
