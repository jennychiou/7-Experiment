I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me 
The road that led me out of his life 
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder 
The day that I told him good-bye 

I never should'a left him 
Never should'a gone 
Oh what a crazy fool I've been 

Will he be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
And will he take me back again 

He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 

Shadows from the trees 
Shade the path that I am walkin' 
As I make my way back up that windy road again 
The smell of mountain laurel fills the air with sweet perfume 
My heart beats faster as I near my journey's end 

I wonder if he missed me 
Wonder if he wants me 
I wonder does he love me still 

Will he be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Oh how I hope he will 

He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 

He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 

Cry, mmmm
