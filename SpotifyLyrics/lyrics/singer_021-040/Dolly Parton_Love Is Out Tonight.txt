As blue skies and daylight darken into night
Surrounding us with beauty as the stars make their light
They spell out our names all the stars up above
As they flicker and shine like letters of love

Then a warm breath of air whispers through the trees
As the leaves on their branches have blown to the breeze
Ripples of water seemed to echo the sound
Love's out tonight there's love all around

Small drops of dew act as nature's perfume
Placing its fragrance on all that's in blue
While I hold you so close your lips touching mine
With nature all around us watching our love entwine

Love's out tonight see the candles in the sky
God lend us the heavens tonight for you and I
A night full of love for all the world to see
Love's out tonight all around you and me
Love's out tonight
