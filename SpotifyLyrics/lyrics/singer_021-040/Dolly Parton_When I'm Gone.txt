You say that you're bored with life and that you're bored with me 
'Cause you say that this love of ours ain't what it ought to be 
Now you despise this little house that we've always called home 
I know that you don't love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone 
Gone 

You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you 
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you 
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along 
Oh, it's true you may not love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone 
Gone 

We've grown too familiar with each other, so you say 
You say there's no excitement now, too bad you feel that way 
Well, I wonder how exciting that your life will be alone 
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone 
Gone 

You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you 
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you 
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along 
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone 
Gone
