She's like a medicine to a sick mind
She'll be a river, so flow with her if you want
She's like a diamond to a rich man
She'll be all you need when you've got everything and more

She'll be anything to anyone
But she gives nothing back to me

She's so thotful, yeah yeah
Thotful as she can be
Aw no no, no no no
She's so thotful
But she don't ever think about me

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la li

She's so thotful
Aw no no, no no no
But she don't ever think about me

She got her looks right from her mama's sides, all right
Her eggs are fried but she will smile and heat your tea
She makes you wish upon a dandelion
While she, she picks the money off your tree

She'll be anything to anyone, whoa
But she gives nothing back to me

She's so thotful, yeah yeah
Thotful as she can be
Aw no no, no no no
She's so thotful
But she don't ever think about me

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la li

She's so thotful
Aw no no, no no no
But she don't ever think about me

I told her when I grow up I would be a star
So she went down the road and pawned my guitar
And said, "Stay home and don't be a fool"
Then I see her round the corner with a you know who

My man Big Lou, Rolls Royce, top choice
Got a couple houses and a whole lot of toys
But she don't wanna play with mine
No she don't no no no
She don't wanna play with mine

She'll be nice enough to everyone she meets
Then she, then she'll gut them till they bleed

'Cause she's so thotful, yeah yeah
Thotful as she can be
Aw she's so thotful
But she don't ever think about me
No no no no no no
She don't ever think about me, yeah yeah
