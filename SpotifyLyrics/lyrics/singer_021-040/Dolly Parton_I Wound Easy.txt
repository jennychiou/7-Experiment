You're late again tonight and I know the reason why
You're out with someone else while I sit home and cry
But I'll just wait right here for you 'cause I know your new love won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast

This isn't the first time your heart has gone a'stray
You have no resistance when temptation comes your way
But I'll forgive you this time like I've always done in the past
I wound easy but I heal fast

You know that I love you more than anything
And you know that I'll forgive you for causing me this pain
Oh, tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast

Yes tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
