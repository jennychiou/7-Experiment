Maybe one day I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

Maybe one day I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
