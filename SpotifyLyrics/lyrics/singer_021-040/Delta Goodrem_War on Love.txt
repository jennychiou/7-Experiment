So I stand on this hill
With my flag held high
With the will to survive
Bullets flying by
Broken hearts scattered on this battlefield
I'm holding out
For something real
I won't give in
I won't give up
I fight the hope 
In this war on love

All the dust has settled
I can finally see
I'm crawling from the wreckage
That's brought me to my knees
Deep inside there's a hunger
Waiting for something true
A light on the horizon
Unanswered prayers that long for someone like you...

So I stand on this hill
With my flag held high
With the will to survive
Bullets flying by
Broken hearts scattered on this battlefield
I'm holding out
For something real
I won't give in
I won't give up
I fight the hope 
In this war on love

I'm gonna hold my ground
A broken arrow in my hand
I'm gonna hold it high above
Yeah, I won't back down
I can see that the smoke is clearing
Distant thunders passing by
Although my heart is calling out
Lets me know that I am still alive...

So I stand on this hill
With my flag held high
With the will to survive
Bullets flying by
Broken hearts scattered on this battlefield
I'm holding out
For something real
I won't give in
I won't give up
I fight the hope 
In this war on love

Calling out can you hear the sound
Of the drum that I'm beating strong and loud

So I stand on this hill
With my flag held high
With the will to survive
Bullets flying by
Broken hearts scattered on this battlefield
I'm holding out
For something real
I won't give in
I won't give up
I fight the hope 
In this war on love
I fight the hope 
In this war on love
I fight the hope 
In this war on love

I won't give in
I won't give up
I fight the hope 
In this war on love
