O come all ye faithful, ye lovers come sing
A cry from the mountains, a call to come worship your coming King
Come praise Him with music, and honor Him with dance
Behold He comes quickly and He carries His reward in His hands

Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah

And build Him a highway on the music of praise
For the Light of the True Morning
Pierced through the darkness His golden rays
Sound loud all you trumpets, a call to all men
To come to His Temple and with solemn reverence to worship Him

Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah

And go to the city and sing out the song
For the walls of the Temple will be shaken
And the music will transcend the concrete and the chrome
And the minds of the children will waken

Sing 'Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth and good will to men!'
Sing 'Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth and good will to men!'
Sing 'Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth and good will to men!'

O come all ye faithful, ye lovers come sing
A cry from the mountains, a call to come worship your coming King

Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah
