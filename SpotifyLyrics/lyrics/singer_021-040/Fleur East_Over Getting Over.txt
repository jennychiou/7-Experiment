Feeling better, looking better, I'm on high
What, wanna wait for, you're no promise at
I know that you miss it, have to kiss you goodbye
I never felt so good in all my life
Bright lights from 9 to 5 AM
Waking up just to do it all again
Oh my heart, oh beat, beat
Oh goes on, oh

No tears to cry, baby I'm over, over getting over you
Gonna sleep tonight, baby I'm over, over getting over you
Where we at, came a way your time with that
I'm not looking back, in a way got time with that
No no, I'm over getting over you

That's an old anthem till I lose my breath
Yeah, and in a good time I'm too young to stress
Never knew love until you love yourself
Well, and if you get that, walk into your left
Bright lights from 9 to 5 AM
Waking up just to do it all again

Oh my heart, oh beat, beat
Oh goes on, oh
No tears to cry, baby I'm over, over getting over you
Gonna sleep tonight, baby I'm over, over getting over you
Where we at, came a way your time with that
I'm not looking back, in a way got time with that
No no, I'm over getting over you
Oh my heart, oh beat, beat
Oh goes on, oh
No tears to cry, baby I'm over, over getting over you
Gonna sleep tonight, baby I'm over, over getting over you
Where we at, came a way your time with that
I'm not looking back, in a way got time with that
No no, I'm over getting over you
