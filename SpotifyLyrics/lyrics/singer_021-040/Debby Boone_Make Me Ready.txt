Got a feelin' that something good is coming 
Could be waiting at the door 
Give me ears so that I can hear You knock 
Make me ready 

Situations may come across my pathway 
Not designed to be ignored 
I need a heart that will feel another's pain 
Make me ready 
Ready Lord 

Give me feet that will go where You are leading 
I want to be there when You call 
Give me hands that reach out to touch the world 
Make me ready 

Never thought that I could be the one 
To be a part of Your plan 
An instrument of Your hand 
When I think of all that You have done 
I want to follow You 
It's the least that I can do 
Make me ready 
Ready Lord 
Ready 

Been too long on the wrong side of compassion 
Don't want to live there anymore 
Give me eyes that see another's pain 
Make me ready 
Ready Lord 

Never thought that I could be the one 
To be a part of Your plan 
An instrument of Your hand 
When I think of all that You have done 
I want to follow You 
It's the least that I can do 
Make me ready 
Make me ready 

Don't let me be satisfied 
With anything less than the flow of Your life 
Strip away all but You 
And be seen in whatever I do
