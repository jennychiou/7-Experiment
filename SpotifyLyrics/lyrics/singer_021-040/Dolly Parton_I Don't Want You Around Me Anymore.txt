You think you're so smart you think I should throw my heart
Down at your feet every time that you walk by
But I I've got news for you 'cause I don't care for you
And I don't care honey if you love me or not
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a standin' at your door
But I I won't be there 'cause I no longer care
And I don't want you around me anymore
Because you can't have your way you tell me everyday
I should grow up stop acting like a child
But I I think it's you that's got some growing to do
And honey I think it's gonna take you quite a while
If you were half as smart...
