If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried

If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls

Alli estare candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls

I'll be there, I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls
