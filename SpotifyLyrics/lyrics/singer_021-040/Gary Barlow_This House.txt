This house, built from stone
Bricks and mortar
Love and hope

Voices, children cry
Parents teach us
Wrong from right

What makes your heart ache?
What makes us thankful for every day?
It's always the brightest light
That takes you home each night

Open the doors and windows
Whole world inside these four walls
More than a building
Floor to the ceiling
A picture of love
That's this house

That's this house
That's this house

Peaceful, home sweet home
Stuff needs fixing but nothing's broke
Full hearts, passing time
So glad this place is
Yours and mine

What makes you soul warm?
What makes us be the people we've become?
It's always the brightest light
That takes you home each night

Open the doors and windows
Whole world inside these four walls
More than a building
Floor to the ceiling
A picture of love
That's this house

Open the doors and windows
Whole world inside these four walls
More than a building
Floor to the ceiling
A picture of love
That's this house

These walls
Full of heart
Brothers, sisters
Play their part

From innocence to teenage fights
Christenings, weddings
This is life
This is life yeah
Oh this house
This is life yeah

Open the doors and windows
Whole world inside these four walls
More than a building
Floor to the ceiling
A picture of love
That's this house

That's this house
That's this house
That's this house
That's this house
