She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
'Cause I don't want to throw rice

I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad

Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
'Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car

No I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her

It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
