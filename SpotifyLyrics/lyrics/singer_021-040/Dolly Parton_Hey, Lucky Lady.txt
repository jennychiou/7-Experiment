Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady 
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady 
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady 
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady 

Lucky lady, that's what I was, I was lucky to have his love 
All a woman could wish for, he was that and so much more 
He was mine and how I loved him before your hands ever touched him 
Long before your temping eyes lured my baby from my life 

Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady 
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady 
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady 

I was happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady 

Is it love or is it pleasure, do you know you've found a treasure 
Are you only having fun, do you know the prize you've won? 
If you don't want something lasting, if it's just the time you're passing 
Lucky lady, give him up 'cause I do love him very much 

Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady 
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady 
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady 
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady 

Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady 
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady
