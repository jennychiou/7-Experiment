Standing in that grocery line, paper or plastic?
Why can I not understand the questions that they're asking?
Young boy you should slow your mind, enjoy the traffic
This day only happens once, listen to the bees, they hum, they hum

And I said hey, if I was a bee
Maybe I could see
And I said hey, if I was a bee
Maybe I could see, maybe I could see

If I was a bee, I would chase the hunnies
All the way to where them flowers grow, if I was a bee, if I was a bee
If I was a bee, I would catch a bus
And sit back and see the world for what it was, what is it now?

And I said hey, if I was a bee
Maybe I could see, oh right
And I said hey baby, if I was a bee
Maybe I could see

(La la la la la la baby, oh no)
'Cause if the bees go, we go, so let go your ego
And if the seas go, we go, so don't spread no evil
Until the seas are the people 'cause we are all equal
And we are one people, so let go your ego
And if the bees go, we go, so let go your ego
And if the seas go, we go, so don't spread no evil
Until the seas are the people 'cause we are all equal
And we are one people, get out the house and chase the sun

Chase the sitting sun, chase the sun, chase the setting sun
