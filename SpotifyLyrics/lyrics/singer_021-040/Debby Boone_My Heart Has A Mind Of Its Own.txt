I told this heart of mine our love could never be 
But then I hear your voice, and something stirs inside of me 
Somehow I can't dismiss 
The memory of your kiss 
Guess my heart has a mind of its own 

No matter what I do, no matter what I say 
No matter how I try, I just can't turn the other way 
When I'm with someone new 
I always think of you 
Guess my heart has a mind of its own 

You're not in love with me, so why can't I forget? 
I'm just your used-to-be; it's wrong, and yet 
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing 
For I'm a puppet and I just can't seem to break the string 
I say "I'll let you go," but then my heart says "no" 
Guess my heart has a mind of its own 
Guess my heart has a mind of its own
