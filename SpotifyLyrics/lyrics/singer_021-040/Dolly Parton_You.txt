The morning sun comes quietly into my room each morning
It wakes me up to greet a brand new day
I arise a thinking that it's so good to be living
Loving you is why I feel this way

You my love it's you that makes me always feel like singing
And every song I sing I sing for you
You and only you can make the sun shine when it's raining
All my happiness I owe to you
You all my happiness I owe to you

The garden of Eden couldn't have been any sweeter
Than this paradise I share with you
Our love outshines the eastern star the brightest in the heavens
Surely heaven must have sent me you

You my love it's you that makes me always feel like singing...
You you make me complete and I love you
