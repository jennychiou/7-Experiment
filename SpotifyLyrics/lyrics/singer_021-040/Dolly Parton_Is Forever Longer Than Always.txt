Your trembling hands held me near 
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear 
You said you'd always love me 
And we'd always be together 
And you promised me your love would last forever 
Is forever longer than always? 
You're gone from me now and you have been for days 
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay 
Unless forever is longer than always 

Is forever longer than always 
You're gone from me now and you have been for days 
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay 
Unless forever is longer than always 
Is forever longer than always?
