So I feel so blue sometimes I want to die
And so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again

But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
Just between you and me you're too much to fotget

So I've lost the only one I've ever loved
And so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I want to cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes

Just between you and me I'm not so sure about it
Just between you and me you're too much to fotget
You're too much to fotget
