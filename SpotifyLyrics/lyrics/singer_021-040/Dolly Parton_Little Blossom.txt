Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonesome 
I wonder why mommy don't come 
She told me to shut up my blue eyes 
And before I woke up she'd be home 

She said she was going to see Grandma 
Who lives by the river so wide 
And I guess my mommy fell in there
And perhaps she won't be home tonight 

So I guess I'll go down and meet daddy 
Perhaps he has stopped at the store 
It's a great big store full of bottles 
And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore 

So out in the night with the baby 
Her little heart beating with pride 
'Til her tired feet entered the gin palace 
With music all radiant with light 

Oh daddy she cried as she reached him 
I think that the music's so sweet 
But it's almost suppertime daddy 
Little blossom wants something to eat 

A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly 
Down into her face sweet and fair 
And as the demon possessed him 
He grasped at the back of a chair 

A moment a second was over 
He lifted her fair golden head 
A moment the baby's life trembled 
Then poor little blossom was dead
