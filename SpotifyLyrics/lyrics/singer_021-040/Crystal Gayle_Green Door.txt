Midnight
One more night without sleepin' -
Watchin'
Till the morning comes creepin'.
Green door
What's that secret you're keepin'?
There's an old piano and they play it hot behind the green door
Don't know what they're doin'
But they laugh a lot behind the green door.
Wish they'd let me in
So I could find out what's behind the green door.
Knocked once
Tried to tell 'em I'd been there

Door slammed
Hospitality's thin there.
Wonder just what's goin' on in there.
Saw an eyeball peepin' through a smokey cloud
Behind the green door

When I said
Joe sent me

Someone laughed out loud behind the green door.
AII I want to do is join the happy crew behind the green door.
Midnight
One more night without sleepin' - ...
Saw an eyeball peepin' through a smokey cloud ...
Wish they'd let me in
So I could find out what's behind the green door.
