In these days of confused situations 
In these nights of a restless remorse 
When the heart and the soul of a nation 
Lay wounded and cold as a corpse 

From the grave of the innocent Adam 
Comes a song bringing joy to the sad 
Oh, your cry has been heard and the ransom 
Has been paid up in full 
Be ye glad 

Oh be ye glad, oh be ye glad 
Every debt that you ever had 
Has been paid up in full 
By the grace of the Lord 
Be ye glad, be ye glad 
Be ye glad 

Now from your dungeon, a rumor is stirring 
And your eyes show the sorrow they've had 
Ah, but this time the cell keys they're turning 
He has opened the gates 
Be ye glad 

Oh be ye glad, oh be ye glad 
Every debt that you ever had 
Has been paid up in full 
By the grace of the Lord 
Be ye glad, be ye glad 
Be ye glad 

So be likes lights on the rim of the water 
Giving hope in a storm sea of night 
Be a refuge amidst the slaughter 
Of these fugitives in their flight 

For you are timeless and part of a puzzle 
You are winsome and young as a lad 
And there is no disease or no struggle 
That can you pull you from God 
Be ye glad 

Oh be ye glad, oh be ye glad 
Every debt that you ever had 
Has been paid up in full 
By the grace of the Lord 
Be ye glad, be ye glad 
Be ye glad
