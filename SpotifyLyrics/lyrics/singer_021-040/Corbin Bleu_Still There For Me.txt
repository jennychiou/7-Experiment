Lately I've been thinking about the things that we've been through
And I don't know if I'd be here if not for you
I had to take a little time to try to work things out
And you should know that I had never meant to let you down

'Cause I, I wanna tell you
That I'm sorry and I, I

Even when I'm not giving enough and I'm taking too much
You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall
You're still there for me, there for me, there for me

Even when I can't be there for you
You're always there for me

Sometimes I know I can be so hard to understand, it is okay
Even when I'm lost you show me who I really am
Life with me hasn't always been an easy ride
But because of you I've learned to lose my selfish pride

'Cause I, I wanna tell you
That I'm sorry and I, I

Even when I'm not giving enough and I'm taking too much
You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall
You're still there for me, there for me, there for me

Even when I can't be there for you
Oh, you're always there for me

Oh, no, it's love, ooh
It must be love, oh
It's gotta be real love
It's gotta be real love, real love

Even when I'm not giving enough and I'm taking too much
You're still there for me
Even when I got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall
You're still there for me, there for me, there for me

Even when I can't be there for you when I can't be there
Even when I can't be there for you
You're always there for me
