How many arms have held you 
And hated to let you go 
How many, how many I wonder 
But I really don't want to know 

And how many lips have kissed you 
And set your soul aglow 
How many, how many I wonder 
But I really don't want to know 

So always make me wonder 
And always make me guess 
Even if I ask you 
Darlin', don't confess 

No you just let that remain your secret 
'Cause darlin' I do love you so 
How many, how many I wonder 
But I really don't want to know 

How many, how many I wonder 
But I really don't want to know
