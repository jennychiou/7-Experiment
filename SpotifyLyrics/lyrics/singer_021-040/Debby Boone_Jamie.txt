Baby
Nobody has to remind me
Lately
You're all I have on my mind, you see
Someone told me that if it was meant to be

Oh, Jamie
You and I could go on forever
Oh, Jamie
People might think it's wrong, whatever
But since I've only known you a week
Even one more night would be all right
You and I could go on forever
And forever never felt so much like

Jamie
I'm not sure yet where there is going
Maybe
I don't really have to be knowing
Oh someone told me that if it was meant to be

Oh, Jamie
You and I could go on forever
Oh, Jamie
People might think it's wrong, whatever
But since I've only known you a week
Even one more night would be all right
You and I could go on forever
And forever never
I said forever never
Forever never felt so much like
Jamie
You and I could go on forever
