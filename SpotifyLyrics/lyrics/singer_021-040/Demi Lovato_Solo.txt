You speak to me
And in your words I hear a melody
But in the twilight it's so hard to see
What's wrong for me

I can't resist
Until you give the truth a little twist
As if you're gonna get away with this
You're not sorry

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
Your losing me is what you've won
Got me planning to go solo, solo

You sing to me
Too bad you couldn't even stay on key
If your life is such a mystery
Why don't you just stick to acting?

Here we go again
You couldn't even find my number until when
You thought that you could get to my best friend
Without a script your game is lacking

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
Your losing me
Here's what you've won
Got me planning to go solo, solo

I'd rather go to a party alone
Than have to walk around with you on my arm
Now that I'm proud to admit that we're done
Good luck trying to find me...

'Cause I didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
Your losing me is what you've won
Got me planning to go solo

Now we're done
'Cause you've got me planning to go solo, solo
Solo, solo
