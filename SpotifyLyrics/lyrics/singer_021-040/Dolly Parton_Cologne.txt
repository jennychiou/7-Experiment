You ask me not to wear cologne
She'll know you've been with me alone
And you can't take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne

You can wipe the make up off
The lipstick or a little gloss
But fragrance lingers on and on
So you ask me not to wear cologne

You leave my bed and go to hers
Leaving me alone and hurt
I love you whether right or wrong
And you ask me not to wear cologne

I'm not out to hurt someone
Not you, not her, not any one
But I've got heartaches of my own
Why, I can't even wear cologne

Oh but I never meant for this to be
It wasn't in my heart to cheat
Love has a nature all it's own
So I willingly gave up cologne

And every time you come to me
I realize I'm in too deep
I know you love us both and I keep holding on
You ask me not to wear cologne
You say, "Don't wear cologne"

Oh now what am I ever gonna do
'Cause I am so in love with you
I know you love us both
But where do I belong
You ask me not to wear cologne

You ask me not to wear cologne
She'll know you've been with me alone
And you can't take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne

How do I walk away from the greatest love I've known
You ask me not to wear cologne
Oh you ask me not to wear cologne

You ask me not to wear cologne
She'll know you've been with me alone
And I'm a scent you can't take home
