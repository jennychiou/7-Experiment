Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
Don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you

I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But I promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free, dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true

Please help me, I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
Don't let me walk in
For I mustn't want you
But, darling, I do
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
