Hey!

I should've known when I got you alone (Hey)
That you were way too into me to know (Hey)
This isn't love boy this ain't even close
But you always think we're something that we're not
And now you call me every single night (Hey)
I only answer 'cause I'm too polite (Hey)
We happened once or maybe it was twice
Yeah you always make it hard for me to stop
But you always think we're something that we're not

You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again
Stop try'na to get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook up
It's getting stupid 'cause
I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, hey!

I hear you're telling everyone you know (Hey)
That I'm the one like you can't let me go (Hey)
And you just keep on blowing up my phone
'Cause you never seem to know when you should stop
Don't introduce me to any of your friends (Hey)
Delete my number don't call me again (Hey)
We had some fun but now it's gonna end
But you always made it hard for me to stop
Now you always think we're something that we're not, hey!

You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again
Stop try'na to get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook up
It's getting stupid 'cause
I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, hey!

Something that we're not
Hey!
You think we're something that we're not
Yeah, you think we're something that we're-
Not gonna happen dude, oh

You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again
Stop try'na to get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook up
It's getting stupid 'cause
I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, hey!

Something that we're not
Hey!
You think we're something that we're not, hey!

Something that we're not
