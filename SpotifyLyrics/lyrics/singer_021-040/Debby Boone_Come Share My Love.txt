Perhaps the love we feel today
Tomorrow may be gone
Perhaps we'll leave our dreams far behind
But today is still today
And before it all fades away
While we're together and while there still is time

Come share my life
Come share my love
While we are young and we are free
Come share my life
Come share my love
Come and share the good times with me

I don't ask forever
I don't need much of your time
Just time enough to love and laugh for a while
I hope it lasts a lifetime
And not just one more night
But whatever's meant to be will be
That'll be alright

Come share my life
Come share my love
While we are young and we are free
Come share my life
Come share my love
Come and share the good times with me

I hope it lasts a lifetime
And not just one more night
But whatever's meant to be will be
That'll be alright

Come share my life
Come share my love
While we are young and we are free
Come share my life
Come share my love
Come and share the good times with me

Come share my life
Come share my love
While we are young and we are free
Come share my life
Come share my love
Come and share the good times with me
