I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

Well, I couldn't see the light for the brightness
Of the sweet little smile you gave me
I couldn't see how you were cheatin' on me
But finally I'm a catchin' on, on
Finally, I'm a' catchin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

I couldn't see the hurt for the happy
And at first that's the way you made me
It took me a while to get your style
But finally I'm a' catchin' on, on
Finally I'm a' catchin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

You say you can't see the light for the darkness
That surrounds you since I'm gone
You can't eat or sleep 'cause you're lonely
Well, finally you're catchin' on, on
Finally you're a' catchin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm a caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
