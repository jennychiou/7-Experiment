I couldn't believe it the day that you left
Cleaned out your closet cleared off your shelves 
Loaded your car and you drove out of sight
But I never said goodbye

I'll never say goodbye the door's always open I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by I'll never say goodbye

People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye

I'll never say goodbye the door's always open I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life and I'll never say goodbye

I'll never say goodbye the door's always open I leave on a light
I'll be loving you till the day that I die and I'll never say goodbye
If you'll just come back I won't even ask why
I'll never say goodbye no I'll never say goodbye
