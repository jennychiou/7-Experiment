Babe, I heard you're getting married 
Heard you're getting married, this time you're really sure 
And this is the end, they say you really mean it 
This girl's the one that makes you feel so safe 
So sane and so secure 

And baby, if she loves you more than me 
Maybe it's the best thing 
Maybe it's the best thing for you 
But it's the worst that could happen to me 

I'll never get married, never get married 
You know that's not my scene 
But a guy like you needs to be married 
I've known all along you couldn't live forever in between 

And baby, if she loves you more than me 
Maybe it's the best thing 
Maybe it's the best thing for you 
But it's the worst that could happen to me 

Hey, I don't really blame you 
For having a dream of your own 
And hey, I really don't blame you 
A man like you needs a house and a home, baby 

If she really loves you more than me 
Maybe it's the best thing 
Maybe it's the best thing for you 
But it's the worst that could happen 

Never, never gonna get married 
Oh babe, I heard you're getting married 
Never, never gonna get married 
Baby, baby, I still love you baby 
Never, never gonna get married
