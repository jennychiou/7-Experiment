Darlin', I'm outside your door,
Knowin' you'll welcome me in.
Don't have to knock twice, it feels so right
Bein' here with you again.

Might not be the right thing to do
But I swear it doesn't feel wrong.
Might not be forever, but never say never,
I'm standin' outside of your door.

I guess I should feel cheap,
But I just can't keep
My mind and my hands off of you.
The way we make love
Is so far above
Anything I ever knew.

So here I am, I'm outside your door,
Knowin' what's waitin' inside.
Heaven on earth and for all that it's worth,
We'll be here till we're both satisfied.

Two bottles of wine, one white and one red,
Few drinks to unwind, and then be off to bed.
We can't fight this passion, no need to pretend
And oh yes, I'll be outside your door again.

Darlin', I'm outside your door,
And I know you welcome me in.
(Don't have to knock twice)
It feels so right
Just bein' here with you again.
Yeah, I'm standin' outside of your door (once more)
And I know you'll welcome me in.

Don't have to knock twice, it feels so right,
Standin' outside of your door, once more.
I'm standin' outside of your door,
(Outside your door)
Once more.
(Outside your door)
