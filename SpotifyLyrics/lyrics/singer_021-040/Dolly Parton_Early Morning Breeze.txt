I open up my door to greet the early morning sun 
Closing it behind me and away I do run 
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree 
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze 
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly 
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild 
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me 
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze 

Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun 
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums 
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves 
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze 

Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray 
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day 
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees 
To have a word with God in the early mornig breeze 

A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun 
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums 
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves 
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
