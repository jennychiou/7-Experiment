Listen, hey yo, super loops in the building
Hey, I like this right here, yeah
Put away them tissue boxes,
Girl I promise all them cloudy, rainy days are over
Hey, and baby I'm'ma be your umbrella
Hey, you say goodbye to them puffy eyes
Love is war and girl I'll be your soldier
Hey, and baby I will fight for you forever

Baby, it's my mission,
To be one that's always here to listen
And girl you'll be fine
'Cause now that you're mine

I don't wanna see no more tears on your pillow!
Don't wanna see no more tears on your pillow
And this is my song for you
I can't give you all the world but I promise
That now that you're my girl
There's gonna be no more tears on your pillow
No more tears on your pillow
No more

Sleepless nights and fuss and fighting
Now the mission's blowing in the wind now yeah
Where you wanna go, I'm gonna take you!
Kiss my lips and take your fingertips,
Run them through my hair
This is all we're talking about
I know that I will be gentle, I won't break you

Baby, it's my mission,
To be one that's always here to listen
And girl you'll be fine
'Cause now that you're mine

I don't wanna see no more tears on your pillow!
Don't wanna see no more tears on your pillow
And this is my song for you
I can't give you all the world but I promise
That now that you're my girl
There's gonna be no more tears on your pillow
No more tears on your pillow
No more

So girl, here, come take my shoulder
And let those tears fall 'cause I told ya
This gonna be the last time that you cry
So all them other boys don't need to reply
Cause girl, you'll be fine
Cause now that you're mine

I don't wanna see no more tears on your pillow!
Don't wanna see no more tears on your pillow
And this is my song for you
I can't give you all the world but I promise
That now that you're my girl
There's gonna be no more tears on your pillow
No more tears on your pillow
No more tears on your pillow
