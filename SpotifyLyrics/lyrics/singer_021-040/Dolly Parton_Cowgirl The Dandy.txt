In the airport lounge, he sat with his cane and durby hat
The grandest man that I had ever seen
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
So I asked him if he'd like some company

In my rhinestone-studded suit
And my cowgirl high-heel boots
I must have been a site for him to see
But he said, "Pull up a chair"
As I fumble with my hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see

I was Mogan David wine
He was Chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat
The cowgirl and the dandy

He was ski resorts in Aspen
And summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry Nashville, Tennessee

The cowgirl and the dandy
As different as can be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

Then somewhere in between
His Harvey's Bristol cream
And the beer that I kept sippin' at his table

We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cowgirl
An' there's a little country in the dandy

The cowgirl and the dandy
As different as can be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

I was Mogan David wine
He was Chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat
The cowgirl and the dandy

He was ski resorts in Aspen
And summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry Nashville, Tennessee

He was ski resorts in Aspen
And summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry Nashville, Tennessee
