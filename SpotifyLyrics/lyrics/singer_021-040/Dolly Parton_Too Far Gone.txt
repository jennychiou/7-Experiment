We never have a kind word for each other angry words are all we speak
The home where we once lived and loved now echoes with the angry words we speak
Too selfish and too proud to admit it when we know that we are wrong
Now it's too late to rebuild the home we're tearing down it's too far gone

Two people just existing always talking never listening
Too busy pointin' out each other's fault to see our own
Because we didn't try our love just slowly died
Too late to be revived it's too far gone
(Too far gone too far gone too far gone)

We're too busy thinking of ourselves to think about each other's needs
We seldom have a moment for each other we share little that we need
We can't get along even long enough to try to change what's wrong
Now it's too late for you and me there's nothing we can do we're too far gone

Two people just existing...
