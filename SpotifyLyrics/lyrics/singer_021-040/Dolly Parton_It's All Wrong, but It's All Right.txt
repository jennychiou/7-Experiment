Hello, are you free tonight 
I like your looks, I love your smile 
Could I use you for a while 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
The amber sunset glow has died 
My needs are very much alive 
Is it ok if I stop by 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 

It's all wrong, but it's all right 
Just close your eyes and hold me tight 
Tell me sexy lovin' lines 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 

It may be wrong if we make love 
But I just need someone so much 
And who knows it might last for life 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 

It's all wrong, but it's all right 
Just close your eyes and hold me tight 
Tell me sexy lovin' lines 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 

It's all wrong, but it's all right 
Just close your eyes and fantasize 
Tell me sexy lovin' lines 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 

It's all wrong, but it's all right 
Just close your eyes and hold me tight 
Tell me sexy lovin' lines 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 

It's all wrong, but it's all right 
Just close your eyes and fantasize 
Tell me sexy lovin' lines 
It's all wrong, but it's all right
