Before you make up your mind to leave me
Before you make up your mind to walk out the door
Before you telle me that it's all over
Let me say what I have to say it won't take me all day
And if you still wanna leave don't stay for I won't try to hold you anymore
Does she really love you way that I love you
Does she treat you right even when you've done wrong
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind
