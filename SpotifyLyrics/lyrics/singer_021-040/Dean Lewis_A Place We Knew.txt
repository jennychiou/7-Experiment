I can picture you now, taking your makeup off
You come into my room and you kiss my lips
But this hotel life, I'm not used to it
And you wear your heart right on your sleeve
But it took you a while to open up to me
I still love the way that you smile when you leave

And I know you get scared, when I'm away
But I think about you almost all the day
And I promise you that I'll be back again
Just can you remember? Oh, can you remember when we were

Dancing in hotel rooms, it was just me and you
We wouldn't sleep all night, with you sitting by my side
And every moment we had stolen was a feeling
'Cause it never mattered where we were
'Cause we were falling in love
Your heart is my home, your heart is my home
Your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go

When I was feeling down, you always picked me up
It didn't matter what I was doin' wrong, 'cause
I've lived my life without you for too long

But when I walked through the door and I saw your face
Ooh, I knew in that moment that my world had changed
How could I live my life since you been and gone?
But can you remember? Just try to remember when we were

Dancing in hotel rooms, it was just me and you
And we wouldn't sleep all night, with you sitting by my side
And every moment we had stolen was a feeling
'Cause it never mattered where we were
'Cause we were falling in love
'Cause your heart is my home, your heart is my home
Your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go

But in any single moment you can change
'Cause I've been gone so long and I can feel you slip away, but...
I'm getting closer and closer
Can you remember? Just try to remember when we were...

Dancing in hotel rooms, it was just me and you
We wouldn't sleep all night, with you sitting by my side
And every moment we had stolen was a feeling
'Cause it never mattered where we were
'Cause we were falling in love
'Cause your heart is my home, your heart is my home
Your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go

'Cause your heart is my home, your heart is my home
Your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go
'Cause your heart is my home, your heart is my home
Oh, your heart is my home, and I'm never letting go
