Once more to be with you dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more

Forget the past this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love I need say you'll love me
And say you'll give me all of your heart

Once more to be with you dear...

Once more to be with you dear...
