Let us break bread together on our knees 
Let us break bread together on our knees 
When I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun, 
O Lord, have mercy on me 

Let us drink wine together on our knees 
Let us drink wine together on our knees 
When I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun, 
O Lord, have mercy on me. 

Let us praise God together on our knees 
Let us praise God together on our knees 
When I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun, 
O Lord, have mercy on me
