Little Jenny with the big brown eyes
Had a smile that could light the skies
She had dreams of being a star
Had dreams of going so far

But you can't choose the life you got
And you can't choose your mom and pop's
And hers never did a thing to help
Most times he was by herself

So little Jenny got desperate
And out on the street she went
Doing things she know she shouldn't
All she really needed was a friend

Now baby girl feels oh, so low
Never knew the world was so cold
But this ain't gotta be the end
So Jenny, if you're listening

I know there's a fighter deep down inside of
You my love 'cause you're a champion
I know you'll get by 'cause you're a survivor
It's true my love 'cause you're a champion, yeah

Now Jordan had everything
Straight A's and a record so clean
QB of the football team
The kinda guy you might envy

But perfect don't mean you're happy
He was searchin' for more, you see
Not satisfied having the best
Wanted to live on the edge

To much time and to much money
That's a dangerous recipe
He started trying things he shouldn't have
Pretty soon it was outta hand

Lost touch with reality
Now all he got are shattered dreams
But this ain't gotta be the end
Hey Jordan if you're listening

I know there's a fighter deep down inside of
You my love 'cause you're a champion
I know you'll get by 'cause you're a survivor
It's true my love 'cause you're a champion, yeah

I know that you're gonna get through
'Cause you got everything in you
To carry on, yeah you're a champion, yeah
I know that you're gonna get through
'Cause you got everything in you
To carry on, yeah you're a champion, yeah

I know there's a fighter deep down inside of
You my love 'cause you're a champion
I know you'll get by 'cause you're a survivor
It's true my love 'cause you're a champion, yeah

I know there's a fighter deep down inside of
You my love 'cause you're a champion
I know you'll get by 'cause you're a survivor
It's true my love 'cause you're a champion, yeah
