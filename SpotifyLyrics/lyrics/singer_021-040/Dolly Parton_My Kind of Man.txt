If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really not
My kind of man

I don't believe you have the right
To ask me to be different
Either take me like I am
Or let me be

If you really love me
I mean, really loved or love me
You wouldn't want to change
One part of me

If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can

If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man

I couldn't make you happy
If I let you change me
For I know you wouldn't love me
That-a way

I can only be myself
But if you want something else
Then I can see no reason
I should stay

If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can

If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man

If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
