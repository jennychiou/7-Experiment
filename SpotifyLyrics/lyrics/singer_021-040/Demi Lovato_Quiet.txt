I hear what you're not saying
It's driving me crazy
It's like we stopped breathing in this room
We're both the last to be leaving
I know what you're thinking
I wish you'd make you move

It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence
Finally

It's like you know where I'm going
You follow me home but
I never invite you inside
I see what you're not showing
I've got you alone but
The air is so still, it's weird

It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence
Finally

Don't stop, don't stop
Telling me goodnight
Just promise you'll kiss me goodbye
What's taking so long?
Don't tell me you're not gonna try
The tension's building in my mind
I wanna scream and I know why

It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence
Finally

Make it all go away
It's so quiet in here
