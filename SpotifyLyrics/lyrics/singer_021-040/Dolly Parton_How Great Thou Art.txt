Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
Now I see the stars and I hear the rolling thunder
Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee how great Thou art oh how great Thou art

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee how great Thou art how great Thou art
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God how great Thou art

Then sings my soul...
