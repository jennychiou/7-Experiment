Hittin' me up late always be blowin' up my phone
I'm lying awake wonderin' why I'm still alone
Lord knows I am sinning, please forgive me for my lust
Sending pictures back and forth
Babe, I'm craving your touch

You're my new obsession
Let go of any hesitation
Baby, be my new addiction
Intoxicate me gently with your loving

You got me so high
Pull me closer into you and watch our bodies intertwine
I feel so alive
You know what I'm thinking of
Got me dreamin' 'bout that sexy dirty love
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)

Now you're teasing me and I can't help but do the same
Whispering through your phone, now you're driving me insane
It's like you're getting off on messing with my sanity (sanity)
Hang up, come on over
Let's play out this fantasy

You're my new obsession
Let go of any hesitation
Baby, be my new addiction
Intoxicate me gently with your loving

You got me so high
Pull me closer into you and watch our bodies intertwine
I feel so alive
You know what I'm thinking of
Got me dreamin' 'bout that sexy dirty love
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)

You're my new obsession
Let go of any hesitation
Baby, be my new addiction
Intoxicate me gently with your loving, oh

You got me so high
Pull me closer into you and watch our bodies intertwine
I feel so alive
You know what I'm thinking of
Got me dreamin' 'bout that sexy dirty love
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
