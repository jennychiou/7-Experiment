Without you
The days come and go they mean nothing to me
Nothing means nothing without you
My eyes overflow till all I can see
Is a future I can't face without you

Without you without you it's not like before
How can I face life without you
The days are as dark as the nights anymore
And I am so lonely without you without you

Too many things to remind me of you
How could I forget about you
Oh how can I make it now that I've lost you
For I am so lost without you

Without you without you it's not like before...
