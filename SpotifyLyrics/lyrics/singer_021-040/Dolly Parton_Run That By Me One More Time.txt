Run that by me one more time
To make sure that I heard you right
I hope you don't expect me to believe that line
I might be crazy, but I ain't dumb
And I know a lie when I hear one
Would you run that by me one more time?
Well, you're late again, I see
What's your excuse this time?
Don't you try to kiss and make up
When you smell so strong from wine

Well, I'm not late, the clock is wrong
You need to wind Big Ben
Honey, that's not wine you smell
That's aftershave for men

Would you run that by me one more time?

What happened to the money
I gave you to pay the rent?
The rent is overdue
And we ain't got one red cent

I put it in the cookie jar
The day you brought it home
One day when I came back from town
I looked and I'll be dogged if that money wasn't gone!

Would you run that by me one more time?
