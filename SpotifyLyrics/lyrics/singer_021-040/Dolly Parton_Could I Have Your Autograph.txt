Hello, I don't know me from Adam, you don't know me from Eve 
I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely 
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe 
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so 
Hey could I have your autograph 
Your name and your number on a small photograph 
I'd like to know you and what you're all about 
Hey could I have your autograph 

I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at 
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that 
You may not be famous but you look like a star 
You should be in movies as cute as you are 

Hey could I have your autograph 
Your name and your number on a small photograph 
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps 
Hey could I have your autograph 

Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds 
And you're everything every girl dreams about 
And being with you would be heaven no doubt 
What I wouldn't do for your autograph 

Oh could I have your autograph 
Oh could I have your autograph 

Hey could I have your autograph 
I like your body could I help you work it out 
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph 
Hey could I have your autograph 

Oh could I have your autograph 
You know you're just the kind to makes a woman real proud 
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South 
Could I have your autograph
