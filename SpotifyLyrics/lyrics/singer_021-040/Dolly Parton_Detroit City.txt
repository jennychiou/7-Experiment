You know last night I went to sleep in Detroit city 
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home 
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sisters and brothers 
And I dreamed about a love who's been waiting there so long
 
I want to go home 
I want to go home 
Oh how I want to go home 
My kinfolks think I'm big in Detroit city 
From all the letters that I write, they think I'm fine 
By day I make the cars 
But, by night I make all the bars 
Oh if only they's just read between the lines 

They'd know I want to go home 
I want to go home 
Oh how I want to go home 

You know I rode a freight train north to Detroit city 
And after all these years I find I've been wasting my time 
Think I'll put my foolish pride on a southbound train and ride 
Heading back to the loved ones I left there waiting behind 

I want to go home 
I want to go home 
Oh how I want to go home
