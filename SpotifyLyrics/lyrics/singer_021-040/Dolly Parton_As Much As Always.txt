I hoped I wouldn't miss you long
But I still can't believe you're gone
And I still miss you just as much as always
I hoped I'd get you off my mind
It's been a long time but I find
That I still think of you as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always

As much as always just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
I still want you, still need you
Just as much as always

I hoped that I'd find someone else
But there's too much of you still left
And I still love you, just as much as always
I hoped that I'd forget your touch
But I still want it just as much
And I still need it just as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always

As much as always, just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still love you, oh I do love you
Just as much as always

As much as always, as much as always
I still love you, still want you, just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still need you still love you
Just as much as always
