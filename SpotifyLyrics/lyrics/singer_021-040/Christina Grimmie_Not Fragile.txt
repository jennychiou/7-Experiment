Bet you didn't think,
I could walk through fire.

Come out stronger,
On the other side.
I made a scene,
And you can't deny.

Inside your head,
I will never win.

You let them,
Tell them you,
Who you are, but,
I'm me, I'm heading far.

I'm not breakable, 
I'm unshakable,
Why you trying to,
Hold me down?

(Why you trying),
(Trying to hold me down)?

I'm not breakable,
So unstoppable,
Nobody's gonna,
Knock me out.

No bending me,
I'll never be,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No one will see,
Fragments of me,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

I packed my bags,
And I'm out the door.

Don't let it hit,
You on the way out.
I'm moving on,
Don't have a doubt.

I'm not breakable, 
I'm unshakable,
Why you trying to,
Hold me down?

(Why you trying),
(Trying to hold me down)?

I'm not breakable,
So unstoppable,
Nobody's gonna,
Knock me out.

No bending me,
I'll never be,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No one will see,
Fragments of me,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No bending me,
I'll never be,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No one will see,
Fragments of me,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

Mirrors can crack,
And hearts can collapse.
Oh, I'm not fragile,
Like that.

Lights will burn out,
And walls can fall down.
Oh, I'm not fragile,
Like that.

No bending me,
I'll never be,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No one will see,
Fragments of me,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No bending me,
I'll never be,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No one will see,
Fragments of me,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No bending me,
I'll never be,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.

No one will see,
Fragments of me,
Like broken glass,
'Cause I'm not,
Fragile like that.
