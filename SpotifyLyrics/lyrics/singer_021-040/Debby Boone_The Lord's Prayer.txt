Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come thy will be done

On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass
Against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom, the power
And the glory.
For ever and ever
Amen.
