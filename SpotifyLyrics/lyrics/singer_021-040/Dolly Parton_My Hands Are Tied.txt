To be with you is what I want more than anything
But I must share my life with the one who wears my ring
And there are tiny places I look into each night
I love you but my hands are tied

I know how much they need you and dear I understand
I know you'll never leave them 'cause you're not that kind of man
But I can't control my feelings though heaven knows I tried
And I love you but my hands are tied

My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied

My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind...
Yes I love you but my hands are tied
