I Wanna Come Back to You by Crystal Gayle 
I've known a better love for a long long time,
Everybody's, but mine.
It took a little while to see
Just how I wanted love to be.

Now I wanna come back to you,
Do you wanna come back to me?
Share the love that used to be a mystery.
I wanna come back to you,
Do you wanna come back to me?
Remember how good it used to be?

I looked back and I wonder why
We were both so careless with goodbye.
Should have known,
Now later on down the line,
We were bound to change our mind.

Now I wanna come back to you,
Do you wanna come back to me?
Share the love that used to be a mystery.
I wanna come back to you,
Do you wanna come back to me?
Remember how good it used to be?

Now I wanna come back to you,
Do you wanna come back to me?
Share the love that used to be a mystery.
I wanna come back to you,
Do you wanna come back to me?
Remember how good it used to be?
