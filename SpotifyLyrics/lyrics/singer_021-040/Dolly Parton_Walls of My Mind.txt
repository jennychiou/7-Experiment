In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind
