I can't see you anymore,
You're in and shut the door.
Didn't know what I do,
Know now.

With words I've been betrayed,
You respond and let them fade.
And I just won't let you,
Bring me down.

You can see what I know and I know,
Somewhere there's a sorry heart.
Tell me why these roads keep leading,
Leading you right back to me.

Liar liar, don't,
Cry on my shoulder.
You played with fire and,
Smiled when you told her.

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Thought you were someone,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Goodbye to no one.

So break away the touch,
Of bliss you miss so much.
But I won't tell you to,
Come back home.

Emotions dissipate;
Is love designed to hate?
Keep on driving away,
From here.

Eye the rain as it falls in your hands,
Will there be another storm?
Tell me why these roads keep leading,
Leading you right back.

Liar liar, don't,
Cry on my shoulder.
You played with fire and,
Smiled when you told her.

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Thought you were someone,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Goodbye to no one.

I don't need to know,
You'll be there,
You're not on my mind.

I don't need to know,
You care, please,
Don't waste my time.

Liar liar, don't,
Cry on my shoulder.
You played with fire and,
Smiled when you told her.

Liar liar, don't,
Cry on my shoulder.
You played with fire and,
Smiled when you told her.

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Thought you were someone,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Goodbye to no one.

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Thought you were someone,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Goodbye to no one.
