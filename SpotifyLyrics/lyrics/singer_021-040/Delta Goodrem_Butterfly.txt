I won't hurt you
I'll protect you
I won't let the rain fall down
I'll always be around

And baby I will understand if sometimes
You just want to spread your wings and fly
And let your colours shine

And everyday I wanna be a risk you take
Make a promise that will never break for life

You're my butterfly
Don't fly away open my hands you're free
Praying you'll come back to me
You're my butterfly
Don't fly away
You're my reality
Always be my gravity
You're my butterfly
Come on and touch the sky
You're my butterfly

I won't forget you
Or neglect you
Won't let no one take your place
In your eyes I see my face

And baby do you know that everybody watches
Every time that you take flight
They're blinded by your light

Every day the feeling's gonna be the same
I can promise that will never change for life
