Hmm
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-yeah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-yeah
Hmm

I called and I wait and a wait went around
And cry with the sound of my heart
Beating for someone that just doesn't pay attention anyway
And I smile when it hurts
To take a breath that day
When you held me and touched my face
Said you wanted to stay by my side
So I pray
You're just a busy bee
And can't get to the phone right now
'Cause you're playing your game

And I hate the sound that it makes
When your heart is sick and tired of palpitating to his stupid play
And just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way

I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way
Just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time

This game he was a pro
He knew all the ropes
Had me wrapped tightly around his dirty finger
What I don't understand is that I'll fall for a man
Who really ain't a man at all
If you know what I'm talking about then
I'm not even gonna complain
'Cause I'm sick and tired of palpitating to his stupid play

And just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way

I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never ever gonna change
Just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way
Oh

I throw my hands up in the air because I care
I throw my hands up in the air 'cause it's not fair
You don't care
It's not fair
Yeah

I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never ever gonna change
And just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never ever gonna change
Just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way

Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah
