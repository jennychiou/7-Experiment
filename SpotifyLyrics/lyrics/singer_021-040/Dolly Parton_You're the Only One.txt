I found out the hard way 
And I'm never gonna break your heart 
I know, too late 
And I don't want to break your heart 
Guess I had to go away just to find 
What I left behind 

You're the only one 
You're the only one 
Take me back 
To where we started from 
And let's make it now 
Like we made it then 
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again 

Nights I lay in bed 
And your covers wouldn't warm my feet 
And morning found me 
Bitter or a bit too sweet 
Oh baby, I had to go away 
Just to run back and say 

You're the only one 
You're the only one 
Take me back 
To where we started from 
Can we make it now 
Like we made it then 
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again 

You're the only one darlin' 
They'll never be anyone else but you 
I love you so much 

You are my love, you've become my life 
And I never meant to break your heart 
But, sometimes, you just got to go away 
To find what you left behind 

You're the only one 
You're the only one 
Take me back 
To where we started from 
Can we make it now 
Like we make it then 
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again 

You're the only one 
You're the only one 
You're the only one 
The only one 
So take me back 
To where we started from 

You're the only one 
The only one 
You're the only one 

You 're the only one 
The only one 
Take me back 
To where we started from 

You're the only one 
The only one 
You're the only one 
You're the only one 
The only one
