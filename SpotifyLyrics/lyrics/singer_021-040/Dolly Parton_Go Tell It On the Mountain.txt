Go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watch o'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens there shown a holy light

Go tell it on the mountain...

The shepherds feared and trembled when low above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Saviour's birth

Go tell it on the mountain...

Go tell it on the mountain...
Go tell it on the mountain...
