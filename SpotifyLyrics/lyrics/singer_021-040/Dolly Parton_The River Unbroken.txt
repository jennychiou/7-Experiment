Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance

Oh-oh-ooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-ooh-oh when will the whistle blow

Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is

All night sleepin' in a station
My God, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness

Oh-oh-ooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-ooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-ooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-ooh-oh when will the whistle blow

Sometimes I feel I can't go on, I can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me

Oh-oh-ooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-ooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-ooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-ooh-oh when will the whistle blow

Oh-oh-ooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-ooh-oh when will the whistle blow

Waiting for the train to come
I keep waiting for the train to come...
