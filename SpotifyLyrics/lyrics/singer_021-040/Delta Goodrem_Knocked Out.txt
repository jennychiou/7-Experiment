Pushed out from the standing start
Forced to run
I was minding my own heart
Before the gun
I'm the silence in the noise
Just tryin' to break through

Say it's only for the best
So I can breathe
Phoenix buried in the mess 
Inside of me
I don't understand the hurt 
Or why you put it on me?
So you be who you wanna be and I'll be me...

But when I get knocked out
Before you count to ten I'll get up again
And if I get knocked down
After I hit the floor, I'll be coming back at you
Don't underestimate me,
Be careful when you hate me
Don't underestimate me
When I get knocked down

I know where I wanna go
That's up to me
Might not be there yet you know 
But I will be
There's always something in the way if you
Let it stop you...
So you be who you wanna be and I'll be me...

But when I get knocked out
Before you count to ten I'll get up again
And if I get knocked down
After I hit the floor, I'll be coming back at you
Don't underestimate me,
Be careful when you hate me
Don't underestimate me

Say it's all just been a test, to get back to me
Send an arrow where it hurts, and I'll be okay
There's only one way I can live and that is my way
So you be who you wanna be and I'll be me...

But when I get knocked out
Before you count to ten I'll get up again
And if I get knocked down
After I hit the floor, I'll be coming back at you
Don't underestimate me,
Be careful when you hate me
Don't underestimate me
When I get knocked down

I'll be coming back at you

When I get knocked out
