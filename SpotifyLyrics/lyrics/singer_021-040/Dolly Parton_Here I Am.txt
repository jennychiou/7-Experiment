Here I am, oh here I am, here I am 
If you need a love that's true 
Need someone to stand by you 
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am 
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand 
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am 

Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without 
I can help you find what you've been looking for 
Here I am, come to me, take my hand 'cause I believe 
I can give you all the love you need and more 
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am 

My world is such an empty place 
I need someone to fill the space 
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am 
'Cause I've got so much love to give 
I need someone to share it with 
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am 

Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without 
I can help you find what you've been searching for 
Here I am, come to me, take my hand 'cause I believe 
I can give you all the love you need and more 
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am 

Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am 
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
