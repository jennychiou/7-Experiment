Tonight oh it's quiet in mission chapel and the music like his love has died
Away
And I'm standing in the middle of these mem'ries
Mission chapel mem'ries of our wedding day
I see the rives still scattered all around that fall upon my satin wedding gown
And the wedding bells that rang are silent now only mission chapel mem'ries all
Around
Tonight I'm all alone at mission chapel and I'm thinking of my love so far away
While I'm standing in the middle all these mem'ries
Mission chapel mem'ries of our wedding day
I see the rives still scattered all around that fall upon my satin wedding gown
The gown I wore when I became his bride
And now these mission chapel mem'ries fill my eyes
Yes these mission chapel mem'ries fill my eyes
