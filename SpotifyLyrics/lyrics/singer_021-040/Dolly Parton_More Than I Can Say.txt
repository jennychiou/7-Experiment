Your love is like a gentle breeze
That's always blowin' over me
I know you're all I'll ever need
In each and every way
You're both ends of the rainbow
My colors and my pot of gold
I love you with a love untold
More than I can say

You are the song of every bird
You are the poet's every word
Every artist's picture
Every writer's play

You are the glow in every night
You are the warmth in each sunrise
Makes no difference how I try
It's more than I can say

And when I've needed you
You've always been there for me
Been my friend and stood by me
And held me as you loved the world away

And when I've wanted you
You have satisfied my needs
Fulfilled all my fantasies
I love you more and more each day

More than I can say

Oh and sometimes I watch you gently sleep
Listen as you softly breathe
Touch you skin and kiss you sweet
And love you all the way

I reach for you
You come to me
Love me into ecstacy
I will love you endlessly

More than I can say

And when I've needed you
You've always been there for me
Been my friend and stood by me
And held me as you loved the world away

And when I've wanted you
You have satisfied my needs
Fulfilled all my fantasies
I love you more and more each day

More than I can say

I love you more and more each day
More than I can say
More than I can say
More than I can say

More than I can say
