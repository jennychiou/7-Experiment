Tonight I feel a chill in the air 
As cold as that look on your face 
I hear what you're saying but coming from you 
Goodbye seems so out of place 
Now how can you stand there and honestly say 
There never wee any real promises made 

The moon is my witness 
The stars will agree 
They all heard you promise 
You'd always love me 
I know that it's true 
But it's hard to believe 
You lied to the moon 
The stars and me 

And what about all of those warm tender nights 
Did they mean nothing to you 
And where are the feelings I thought that we shared 
Or have you forgotten them too 
Did you think I could just put your memory behind 
When your words are still so very clear in my mind 

The moon is my witness 
The stars will agree 
They all heard you promise 
You'd always love me 
I know that it's true 
But it's hard to believe 
You lied to the moon 
The stars and me 

The moon is my witness 
The stars will agree 
They all heard you promise 
You'd always love me 
I know that it's true 
But it's hard to believe 
You lied to the moon 
The stars and me 

I know that it's true 
But it's hard to believe 
You lied to the moon 
The stars and me 
You lied
