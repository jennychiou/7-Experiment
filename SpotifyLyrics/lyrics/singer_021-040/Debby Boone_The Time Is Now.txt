The time is now
Receive it all
An inheritance of favor from the King
His reward is grand
It's with Him in His hand
For all who reach to hold it, it is there
Wholeness in every way
It's happening today
Here's here to do what He came to do if we allow Him to
He is the savior, healer, deliverer, redeemer
Counselor, refiner, Jesus, messiah now

The time is now
His love is here
To work a total transformation in your soul
To swallow every care
His supply is there
For strength to hope and power to be changed
To see the captives freed
Provide for every need
He's here to give what He came to give if we allow Him to
He is the savior, healer, deliverer, redeemer
Counselor, refiner, Jesus, messiah

He says, If you come to Me I'll run not walk to you
Give Me a heart that's faithful and watch what I will do
I'm able to accomplish it according to My Word
You just wait on Me and see

The time is now
To celebrate
And thank Him for His resurrection life
That he came to revive
Every dream that died
And set in motion all that's standing still
Invite His presence in
Ask Him to begin
He's here to be what He came to be if we allow Him to
He is the savior, healer, deliverer, redeemer
Counselor, refiner, Jesus, messiah,
Helper, restorer, builder, rewarder
The giver of life is here
Receive Him now
