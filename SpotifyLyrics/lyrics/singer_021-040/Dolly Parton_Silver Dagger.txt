Don't sing love songs
You'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here right by my side
In her right hand is a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride
All men are fools
So says my mother
They'll tell you again
Love and lies
And then they'll go
And court someother
Leave you alone to pine inside

My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
On every link, a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged, oh

Go court another tender maiden
In hopes that she might be your wife
For I've been warned so I decided
I'll sleep alone all of my life, oh...

Beware, beware, a silver dagger
