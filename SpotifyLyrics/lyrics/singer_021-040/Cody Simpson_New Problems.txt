You used to say
That all it takes is a dollar and a daydream,
But now you'd do
You'd do anything to deflate me
When you were down and when you cried
Who was there, right by your side, baby?

But now I'm out the door
I won't waste no time thinking about you anymore
'Cause I got new girls, new problems
I won't waste no time talking about you anymore
'Cause I got new girls, new problems

I used to think that all it took was a little love
I guess that's not true, 'cause now I know
That it's not enough

When I was down
And I was crying
You weren't around
You were lying
And when you were down
I was trying
To lift you up, feather in the wind
I'll never do that again

'Cause now I'm out the door
I won't waste no time thinking about you anymore
'Cause I got new girls, new problems
I won't waste no time talking about you anymore
'Cause I got new girls, new problems

(Break it down! Come on!)
Uhh baby got got another another thing coming
Uhh baby got got another another thing coming
Uhh baby got got another another thing coming, coming
Ooh that's why, that's why, that's why I'm going, going, going
I got 99 problems, but you ain't one anymore
'Cause I got a new girl, with some new damn problems baby
Ooh It's a bitch when your ex-girl's talking to your next girl
I got a new girl with some new problems
(Jam it out! Come on!)
