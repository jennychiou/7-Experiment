I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes 
I thought that I was sure of what I saw 
You led me to believe that I was special in your life 
So I left my heart wide open for the fall 

I thought I'd found a safe and loving place inside your heart; 
And I was warm and willing any time 
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet were lying from the start 
But I swear I thought your love was genuine 
What a heartache you turned out to be 

What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep 
Oh, what a heartache, what a heart break, 
Love ain't always what it appears to be 
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be 

It just goes to show that you never can tell 
'Cause I really thought that I knew you well 
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily 

Are all these wishes I'm wishin' to myself 
Just rusty coins in a wishin' well? 
Wishes come true, they come false as well 
It's too late for you and me 
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be 

What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Love is two-faced and easy to deceive 
Oh, what a heartache, what a heartache, 
What a mistake to think I could believe 
What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep 
Ooh, what a heartache you turned out to be 
What a heartache, what a heartache, 
What a heartache, what a heartache, 
What a heartache. 
Ooh, what a heartache you turned out to be 
Ooh, what a heartache 
Oh, what a heartache, 
What a heart break you turned out to be
