There's a bit of magic in a simple little smile
Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile
And there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand
A gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand
Oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
La la la la la la la la la la la la

And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me

La la la la la la la la la la la la

All life has to offer that's what most folks desire
But offer nothing in return, 'cause they don't seem to care
And if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
And if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live

And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me

La la la la la la la la la la la la
