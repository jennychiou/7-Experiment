I went into his prison cell
To write his story, if he'd tell
He spoke as tears fell from his eyes
And he told me when and how and why
And he said...

I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk a little ways
And as we walked
Then we could talk about our future wedding day

But when she said she could never be mine
Well, I held a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried "My love, don't murder me
'Cause I'm not prepared for eternity"

Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I started home 'twixt twelve and one
I cried, "My God, what have I done?"
I killed the one I love tonight
Because she would not be my bride

Well only say that you'll be mine
And in no others arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Down by the banks of the Ohio

Oh, oh, save my soul Lord, save my soul
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio.
