You pull my strings, and push my soul
You fool my heart, with every note
You drop a beat
And kiss my face
You make me move
Then cut the bass

And you work so hard to get me
Just to let me go
Yeah you put me in the spotlight
Just to steal the show
And you try to take me home like
You're DiMaggio
Oh oh oh
It's such a joke

Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song
Without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song
Without the love?
Why are we acting like lovers?
We don't know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
A love song without the love

You're so confused
It's getting old
You wear your ring
But leave me cold
You're beautiful but cause me pain
You play my heart like it's a game

And you work so hard to get me
Just to let me go
Yeah you put me in the spotlight
Just to steal the show
And you try to take me home like
You're DiMaggio
Oh oh oh
It's criminal

Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song
Without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song
Without the love?
Why are we acting like lovers?
We don't know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
A love song without the love

This is the bend before the break
Where we forget the harmony
This is how watercolors fade
Into distant memories

Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song
Without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song
Without the love?
Why are we acting like lovers?
We don't know each other
Even though we used to rule the world (used to rule the world)
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song? (a love song)
A love song without the love
Without the love
Without the love
Without the love
Without the love
