Pictures in my pocket
Are faded from the washer
I can barely just make out your face
Food you saved for later
In my refrigerator
It's been too long since later never came

I know
One day eventually
Yeah I know
One day I'll have to let it all go

But I keep it just in case
Yeah I keep it just in case
In case
You don't find what you're looking for
In case
You're missing what you had before
In case
You change your mind I'll be waiting here
In case
You just want to come home

Strong enough to leave you
But weak enough to need you
Cared enough to let you walk away
I took that dirty jacket
From the trash right where you left it
'Cause I couldn't stand to see it go to waste

I know
One day eventually
Yeah I know
One day I'll have to let it all go

But I keep it just in case
Yeah I keep it just in case
In case
You don't find what you're looking for
In case
You're missing what you had before
In case
You change your mind I'll be waiting here
In case
You just want to come home

In case
You're looking in that mirror one day and miss my arms
How they wrapped around your waist
I say
That you can love me again
Even if it isn't the case

Oh
You don't find what you're looking for
Oh
You're missing my love

You don't find what you're looking for
In case
You're missing what you had before
In case
You change your mind, I'll be waiting here
In case
You just want to come home
In case
