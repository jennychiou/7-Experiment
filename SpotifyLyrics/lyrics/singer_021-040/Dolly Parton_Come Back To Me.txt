Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back come back to me

Oh please come back to me
Come back and say you'll work it out with me
Come back to stay and say you're never gonna leave
Baby come back, come back to me

Oh and kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new

Oh come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity
Baby come back, won't you come back to me?

Kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new

Oh, come back to me
Come back and mend this broken heart in me
Without your love I know I'll never be complete
Baby come back, won't you come back to me

Oh please come back to me
Baby come back, baby come back to me
Baby come back, come back and say I'm all you need
Come back, won't you come back to me

Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back won't you come back to me

Oh, please come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity...
