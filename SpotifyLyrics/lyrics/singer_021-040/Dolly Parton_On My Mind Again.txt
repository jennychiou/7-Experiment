I try hard to forget you and the love I once shared with you 
But my mind won't let forgetfulness come in 
There's no use in pretending. The hurt is just beginning 
Just when I think it's ending you're on my mind again 
On my mind again, just like you've always been 
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin' 
On my mind again, just like you've always been 
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again 

Sometimes I go to places where certain things erases 
All traces of your memory, now and then 
Oh, then something will remind me of the love I left behind me 
Then again, your memory finds me and you're on my mind again 

On my mind again, just like you've always been 
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin' 
On my mind again, just like you've always been 
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again 
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again 
On my mind again
