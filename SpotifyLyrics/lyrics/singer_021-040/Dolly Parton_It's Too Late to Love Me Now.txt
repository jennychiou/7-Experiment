It's too late 
You say you want me, and it's too late 
Once my love for you was so great 
But it's too late to love me now 
It's too bad 
You say you need me, and it's too bad 
I know the feelin' and it's so sad 
But it's too late to love me now 
It's too late to love me now 

Don't you know how hard I tried to hold out just for you? 
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day 
Then someone came into my life, turned my dreams around 
He's takin' all the love you threw away 

It's too late 
You say you want me, and it's too late 
Once my love for you was so great 
But it's too late to love me now 
It's too late to love me now 

Don't you know how hard I tried to hold out just for you? 
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day 
Then someone came into my life, turned my world around 
He's takin' all the love you threw away 

It's too late 
You say you need me, and it's too late 
Once my love for you was so great 
But it's too late to love me now 
It's too late to love me now
