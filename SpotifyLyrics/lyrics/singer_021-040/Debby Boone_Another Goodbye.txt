Just when I could feel myself growing stronger
Healin' another mistake
I stared at your face and my pain was erased
And I knew where the feeling could take me

But I just can't go through another goodbye
I could love you so easy, but I'm scared to try
There's no sense in beginning if we're gonna end
And I can't make it through another goodbye again

Why'd you have to go and say you love me?
Just when I felt so secure
It can all fade so fast, just the hurt seems to last
Now I need something I can be sure of

'Cause I just can't go through another goodbye
I could love you so easy, but I'm scared to try
There's no sense in beginning if we're gonna end
And I can't make it through another goodbye again

So whisper the sound of forever
And make me believe what I hear
I know we've got magic together
But I need to know it won't all disappear

'Cause I just can't go through another goodbye
I could love you so easy, but I'm scared to try
There's no sense in beginning if we're gonna end
And I can't make it through another goodbye again

No, I just can't go through another goodbye
I could love you so easy, but I'm scared to try
There's no sense in beginning if we're gonna end
And I can't make it through another goodbye again

No, I just can't go through another goodbye
