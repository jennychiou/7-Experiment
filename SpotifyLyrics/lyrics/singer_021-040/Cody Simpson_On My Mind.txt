(Cody Simpson - Verse 1)

I'm sleeping through the day
I'm trying not to fade
But every single night
I've just been lying awake
'Cause I, I can't get you off my mind

The moment that we met, I didn't know yet
That I was looking at a face I'll never forget
'Cause I, I can't get you off my mind

I can't get you off my mind
Give me the chance to love you
I'll tell you the only reason why
Cause you are on my mind
I want to know you feel it
What do you see when you close your eyes
Cause you are on my mind

(Cody Simpson - Verse 2)

I want to be best
I want to be worst
I want to be the gravity in your universe
And I, I want to be there to help you fly
I'll help you fly girl

Oh, the longer that I wait
The more that I'm afraid
That someone's gonna fool your heart and take you away

'Cause I, I finally realized,
That I can't get you off my mind

Give me the chance to love
I'll tell you the only reason why
Cause you are on my mind
I want to know you feel it
What do you see when you close your eyes
Cause you are on my mind

Girl I can't live without you
I can't think straight without you, no
So tell me what should I do
If I can't get you off my mind

Give me the chance to love
I'll tell you the only reason why
Cause you are on my mind

I gotta know you feel it
What do you see when you close your eyes
Cause you are on my mind
You're on my mind
You're on my mind all day and night, oh
Cause you are on my mind
