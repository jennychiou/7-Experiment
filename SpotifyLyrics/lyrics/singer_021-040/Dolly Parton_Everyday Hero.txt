He takes the train into the city
To him it's more than just a working day
'Cause he knows he can change the world in his ordinary way
She's got a job, she has a family
She tries to keep them both together
She's barely getting by, saving everything she makes
Day by day it seems it's getting harder to win
How much longer, ready for their ship to come in

These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life

They started out as high school sweethearts
He promised her a life of luxury
And though they don't have riches they have everything they need
The eyes of her child are her diamonds
The gift of his love are her pearls
Together they plan, taking a stand to make this a better world

But never breaking, knowing that their dreams will begin
Getting stronger in each other's arms

These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life

Everybody has a special reason
There's a chosen road to follow
Just remember nothing good comes easy
Don't surrender till you you find your rainbow

These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life

These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
