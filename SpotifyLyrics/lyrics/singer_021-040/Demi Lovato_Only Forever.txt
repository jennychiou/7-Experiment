I've been thinking 'bout the future
And I've been thinking 'bout the now
I know we're gonna be together
I just don't know how

You know when we get close
Can't deny the tension between us both
And I don't wanna pressure you, but I think you need to make a move

I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
And I'll keep waiting (I'll keep waiting)
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever

Yeah, I can tell that you're terrified to take a shot this strong
Should I wait up for you day and night
Just let me know how long

You know when we get close
Can't deny the tension between us both
And I don't wanna pressure you, but I think you need to make a move

I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
And I'll keep waiting (I'll keep waiting)
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever

What if I told you it's too late?
What if I say that I can't wait?
What if I meet somebody else who doesn't leave me on a shelf?
I'll give you one more chance, but it only lasts

Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever
Only forever
