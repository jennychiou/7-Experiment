Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen 
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams 
And anything is possible for those who can believe 
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities 
For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye 
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try 
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue 
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you 

For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little bit harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

Oh I do believe in miracles 
But I know they don't come easy 
So why don't we give destiny 
A helping hand 

For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little bit harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

Life is just too beautiful 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
