Mistakes I made enough to fill a book or two on love
But you helped me change wrong to right
I finally did something perfect in my life

I was a perfect fool to believe you
A perfect fool to think your love was true
For once in my life I did something right
I was a perfect fool for you

I'm used to being wrong
Like thinking you loved me all along
I've been a fool I must admit
But at least I did a perfect job of it

I was a perfect fool to believe you
A perfect fool to think your love was true
For once in my life I did something right
I was a perfect fool for you

I was a perfect fool to believe you
A perfect fool to think your love was true
For once in my life I did something right
I was a perfect fool, perfect fool
I was a perfect fool for you
