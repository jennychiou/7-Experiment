Don't look down,
'Cause it's easy,
Falling from force.
Just let it get,
Take natures course,
Then pickin' it up,
When it's over.

Don't be afraid,
'Cause the chances,
Are there for the take.
But treasure the,
Choices you make.
And know when you,
Must take it slower.

You may think you had it rough,
And try to give it up,
But when you think your stuck,
Just go another way.

Don't let go of good times,
And let the bad ones know,
You feel fine, and wear your,
Heart out on your sleeve.

'Cause love is all,
Love is all you need.

Don't be rushed,
'Cause hurrying,
Causes mistakes.
And make sure to,
Give more then take,
'Cause sharing yourself,
Brings you closer.

You may think you had it rough,
And try to give it up,
But when you think your stuck,
Just go another way.

Don't let go of good times,
And let the bad ones know,
You feel fine, and wear your,
Heart out on your sleeve.

'Cause love is all you need.

Feel with all your senses,
Make sure to let down your,
Defenses, it's just,
One way to make you see.

That love is all,
Love is all you need.

Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh, oh.

Take a chance now,
'Cause its easy.
Take a chance now,
For you and me.

Take a chance now,
You can reach it,
Take a chance with me.

Don't let go of good times,
And let the bad ones know,
You feel fine, and wear your,
Heart out on your sleeve.

Love is all you need.

Feel with all your senses,
Make sure to let down your,
Defenses, it's just,
One way to make you see.

That love is all,
Love is all you need.

Love is all you need,
Love is all, love is all,
Love is all you need.
