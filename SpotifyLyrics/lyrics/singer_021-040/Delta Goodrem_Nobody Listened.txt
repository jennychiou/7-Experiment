I am in one of those dreams
Where you just just keep on falling
No one hears you calling

All that you saw was my smile
But it's been dark for a while
And the days have gone cold
No more sleep for my soul
Or that's what I've been told

Did you think that things would be ok?
That my life could keep going on this way?

When I cried, when I shouted and I screamed and I yelled
And I was mad and I was angry
How come no one could tell?
Say why didn't you listen to me?
Was it really that hard to see?
Nobody listened

One day I found the creature asleep
I had a secret to keep
And now the whole world knows

And if I did now go
And I know be on show
Unprotected did you know
From it all came the blow

Did you think that things would be ok?
That my life could keep going on this way?

When I cried, when I shouted and I screamed and I yelled
And I was mad and I was angry
How come no one could tell?
Say why didn't you listen to me?
Was it really that hard to see?
Nobody listened
Nobody listened

Invader took the breath from me
Healer, the angel did I see

All that you saw was my smile
But it's been dark for a while
And the days have gone cold

When I cried, when I shouted and I screamed and I yelled
And I was mad and I was angry
How come no one could tell?
Say why didn't you listen to me?
Was it really that hard to see?
Nobody listened
Nobody listened

And then I cried and I shouted and I screamed and I yelled
And I was mad and I was angry
How come no one could tell
Say why didn't you listen to me?
Was it really that hard to see?
Nobody listened
Nobody listened

Invader took the breath from me
Healer, the angel did I see

Invader took my breath away
Healer, the angel did I see

It's not too far to go now
Like a train off the rails here
'Cause nobody listened
Nobody listened (nobody listened)

But they're listening now...
