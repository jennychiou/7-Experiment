When your eyes meet mine, my heart beats out of time 
And I burn with desire through and through 
I can't help myself, I can see no one else 
'Cause my eyes can only see you 
My eyes can only see you 
My eyes can only see you 
Your face is always in view 
Oh, and my eyes can only see you 

I want you so much and I long for your touch 
And your eyes tell me you want me too 
Oh, it may not be right, but I'm too weak to fight 
And my eyes can only see you 

My eyes can only see you 
My eyes can only see you 
Your face is always in view 
And my eyes can only see you 
And my eyes can only see you
