It seems so easy 
To just fall in love with you 
Never intending to 
Isn't that just like love? 

And two that once were friends 
May never talk again 
It seems so sad within 
Isn't that just like love? 

Friends stop me every day 
And ask me why you went away 
I just shake my head and say 
Isn't that just like love? 

Sure as my heart will mend 
Someone will smile at me and then 
I'll just do it all again 
Now, isn't that just like love? 

Friends stop me every day 
And ask me why you went away 
I just shake my head and say 
Isn't that just like love?
