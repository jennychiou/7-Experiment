Unforgivable.

Okay, let's keep,
This simple,
I do intend to live my life,
On the safe side.
It's who I am, and it's,
Who you aren't.

I can, I can,
See you clearer,
When you're not lying,
Underneath it all.
And I can't see your,
Complexion, oh-oh.

I know your heart,
The way you choose,
You always want,
The best for you.

Now I'm standing here,
With crying eyes,
I still see through,
Your disguise.

I never meant for you to choose,
You should've known better.
There's nothing left for you to lose,
When you looked at me,
You said you had it all.

But what you did is not,
Unforgivable, unforgivable.
But what you did is not,
Unforgivable, unforgivable.

I know things have,
Been going on,
You know you can't,
Erase your sin.
And now you can't see,
Your reflection.

I know that your,
Heart is breaking,
But is it as torn,
As mine, as mine?

Oh, and you've already,
Made it known
How much you lie,
In what you've shown.
Everything inside my head,
Won't leave me,
Alone, oh woah.

I never meant for you to choose,
You should've known better.
There's nothing left for you to lose,
When you looked at me,
You said you had it all.

But what you did is not,
Unforgivable, unforgivable.
But what you did is not,
Unforgivable, unforgivable.

And even though,
It's been so long,
And now I know this is,
Where I don't want to be.

And I know something's,
Not right and now,
I'm telling you get off of me.

I never meant for you to choose,
(Meant for you to choose),
You should've known better,
(You should've known better).
There's nothing left for you to lose,
When you looked at me,
You said you had it all.

(What you did is not),
But what you did is not,
(Unforgivable, unforgivable),
Unforgivable, unforgivable.

(What you did is not),
But what you did is not,
(Unforgivable, unforgivable),
Unforgivable, unforgivable.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
