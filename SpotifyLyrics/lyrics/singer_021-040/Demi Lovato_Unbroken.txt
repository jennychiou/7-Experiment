Locked up tight
Like I would never feel again
Stuck in some kind of love prison
And threw away the key
Oh, oh

Terrified
Until I stared into your eyes
Made me start to realize
The possibilities
So, so

I'm gonna love you like I've never been broken
I'm gonna say it like it's never been spoken
Tonight, tonight I'm letting go, go, go, go
I'm gonna give it like it's never been taken
I'm gonna fall like I don't need saving
Tonight, tonight I'm letting go, go, go, go, go

So played out
The same lies with a different face
But there's something in the words you say
That makes it all feel so real

I'm gonna love you like I've never been broken
I'm gonna say it like it's never been spoken
Tonight, tonight I'm letting go, go, go, go
I'm gonna give it like it's never been taken
I'm gonna fall like I don't need saving
Tonight, tonight I'm letting go, go, go

No need for me to run, run, run
You're makin' me believe in everything
No need to go and hide, hide, hide
Gonna give you every little piece of me

I'm gonna love you like I've never been broken
I'm gonna love you like I've never been broken

I'm gonna love you like I've never been broken
I'm gonna say it like it's never been spoken
Tonight, tonight I'm letting go, go, go, go
I'm gonna give it like it's never been taken
I'm gonna fall like I don't need saving
Tonight, tonight I'm letting go, go, go, go, go
