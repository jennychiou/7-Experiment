Everyday at twilight
When the sun turns red in the sky
I think of you on that shoreline
Brushing your hair from your eyes.
We were drawing our names on the wet sand
And running away as the tide rolled in

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you!
They say out of mind means out of sight
They couldn't be further from the truth
'Cause I'm in love with you,
I'm still in love with you!

Even if there is an ocean
Keeping your heart from mine
That doesn't mean I'm not thinking
About you all the time
I'm counting the days till I see you,
And somewhere I know that you are too

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you!
They say out of mind means out of sight
They couldn't be further from the truth
'Cause I'm in love with you,
I'm still in love with you!
Oh oh oh

Summertime of our lives
Nothing has ever felt so right
Summertime of our lives, oh
Even though, we had to say goodbye
I know when the world gets wrong
You'll come back to me.

Cause wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you!
They say out of mind means out of sight
They couldn't be further from the truth
Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you!
They say out of mind means out of sight
They couldn't be further from the truth
'Cause I'm in love with you,
I'm still in love with you!
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you no oh oh
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you, babe
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, yeah
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh,
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh,
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh,
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love
I'm still in love with you, oh babe
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you, no oh
I'm in love with you!
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm still in love with you!
I'm still in love with you!
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm still in love with you!
