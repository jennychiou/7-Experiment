I like this right here...
Oh, oh, oh...
Whoa...

This young girl, she's so cute
Everytime I see her, wear a fresh pair of shoes
'Cause this young girl, she's such a killer
Can't wait till I have it, I'ma spend half a milla

I can see us together on top
We livin' like we hit the jackpot
Cha-ching, like money in the bank
You should be with me

You're like my favorite song
On the radio, radio, radio, radio
I could listen to you all day
You're like a music video, video vi-vi-video
I could look at you all day
You make do my two-step all day
You keep me lookin' fly for ya all day
So you should be my girlfriend all day
We're like a hit on my radio, radio

You got this young boy, rackin' his brains
Trying to make you mine, but I don't got a ring

You got this young boy, goin' insane
Tell me that you're single and you're waiting for me

I can see us together on top
We livin' like we hit the jackpot
Cha-ching, like money in the bank
You should be with me

You're like my favorite song
On the radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
I could listen to you all day
You're like a music video, video vi-vi-video

I could look at you all day
You make do my two-step all day
You keep me lookin' fly for ya all day
So you should be my girlfriend all day
We're like a hit on my radio, radio
