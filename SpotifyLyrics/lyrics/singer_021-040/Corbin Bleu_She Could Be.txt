She comes inside
Been playing football with the guys
She's all high fives
And dirty footprints on the floor
Next thing I know,
She's hanging out
She's got her dress and high heels on
And we're alone, I couldn't ask for nothing more

And I love
(I love the way)
A simple smiles reveals it all
She calls my name...

She could be all I'm ever gonna need
She's like a beauty queen
In just her t-shirt and her jeans
She could be just the one I've waited for
Could be a perfect score and more
She could be, She could be, She could be
Mmmhmm

It's Friday night
And her friends are home by nine
We hit the show, tip the bouncer, skip the line
Next thing I know, we're out the door
And now she's dancing in the rain, a fragile flame
Under the pale blue colored light

Oh, I love the way
This girl is not afraid to fall
She calls my name...
(She's callin' out to me)


She could be all I'm ever gonna need
She's like a beauty queen
In just her t-shirt and her jeans
She could be just the one I've waited for
Could be a perfect score and more
She could be, She could be, She could be

That one in a hundred million
A secret the world's been keeping
The music that keeps repeating,
Keeps repeating inside your mind
Like an angel on your shoulder
That makes your colors bolder than you dare
And you want to take her everywhere

She could be
Yeah yeah

Oh, She could be all I'm ever gonna need
She's like a beauty queen
In just her t-shirt and her jeans
She could be just the one I've waited for (just the one, just the one I've waited for)
Could be a perfect score and more
She could be, She could be, She could be, yeah

She could be all I'm ever gonna need
She's like a beauty queen (oh baby)
In just her t-shirt and her jeans
She could be just the one I've waited for
Could be a perfect score and more
Yeah, She could be, she could be, She could be
