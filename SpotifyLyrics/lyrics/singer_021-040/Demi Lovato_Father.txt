Father, I'm gonna say thank you
Even if I'm still hurt
Oh, I'm gonna say bless you
I wanna mean those words

Always wished you the best
I, I prayed for your peace
Even if you started this, this whole war in me

You did your best 
Or did you?
Sometimes I think I hate you
I'm sorry dad for feeling this
I can't believe I'm saying it
I know you were a troubled man
I know you never got the chance
To be yourself, to be your best
I hope that Heaven's given you
A second chance

Father, I'm gonna say thank you
Even if I don't understand
Oh, you left us alone
I guess that made me who I am

Always wished you the best
I, I prayed for your peace
Even if you started this, this whole war in me

You did your best 
Or did you?
Sometimes I think I hate you
I'm sorry dad for feeling this
I can't believe I'm saying it
I know you were a troubled man
I know you never got the chance
To be yourself, to be your best
I hope that Heaven's given you

(You did your best)
(Or did you?)
Sometimes I think I hate you
I'm sorry dad for feeling this
I can't believe I'm saying it
I know you were a troubled man
I know you never got the chance
To be yourself, to be your best
I hope that Heaven's given you
A second chance
