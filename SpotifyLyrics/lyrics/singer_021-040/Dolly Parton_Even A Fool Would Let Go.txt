It's funny how love goes
'Cause I know this could never work out
But honey, how love grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
This can never be
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on

When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go

Love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love has no season
I just know that it's there all the time
Maybe just you and me
I can't believe that it's wrong
Thinking about you and me
Just makes me want to hold on

When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go

Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
When even a fool would let go
