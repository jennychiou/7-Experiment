You never send me flowers 
Or ever buy me candy 
You never bring me pretty things 
When you come to see me 
And you forgot my birthday 
Oh I wish you could see 
How I miss 
The little things 
That you don't do for me 

You never say that I look nice 
Or that you're proud of me 
You overlook 
The little things 
That you should see 

These little things are big enough to hurt 
But too small to make me want to leave 
But I do miss 
The little things 
That you don't do for me 

Now how can I miss flowers 
That never reach my door 
How can I taste candy 
That's still at the candy store 

These little things mean a lot to me 
To you they may be silly 
But I do miss 
The little things 
That you don't do for me 
Yes I miss 
The little things 
That you don't do for me
