You are
Individual... never typical
Everything you do... you do your own way
Letting down your hair... made me stop and stare
Very first time... I saw your face
Way you smile... gotta style
And it shows... you've got it goin' on
How you walk... way you talk
Ya gotta know... your everything I want

Never met girl like you
Your so amazing
Every little thing you do
Gets me every time
Never met a girl like you
You drive me crazy
Your the only one
I think about... day and night

Way you like to play... flirt and run away


Everything you do... so unique
Silly way you dance... don't ya hold back
Use your attitude... be who you wanna be
Your the girl... flipped my world
Ya call me up... and leave some crazy message
Eight o clock... heard you knock
Woke me up... made me wear my pjs to breakfast

The way you keep it chill... with looks that kill
It's a vibe that's all your own
Way you hear your song... and sing along
Silly ring tones on your cell phone
How you like to laugh... every chance
And the way you say my name
Your unusual... original
In every single way
