Waiting, watching
Listening to every little sign I see
You are so bright
Shining above all the city lights
You know, it's right
When all of the stars in the sky align
If you and I,
We are together as one tonight

So get up, stand up
What you waiting for?
Let's go, jump in
We got to live life,
Give in to begin
We gotta love like no one else
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Just sitting on top,
Sitting on top of the world

Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, ooh

Saved me from me
You gave me everything I need
You'll be forever in my heart

So get up, stand up
What you waiting for?
Let's go, jump in
We got to live life,
Give in to begin
We gotta love like no one else
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Just sitting on top,
Sitting on top of the world

Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, ooh

All in quiet at night
We say only things for us to hear

So get up, stand up
What you waiting for?
Let's go, jump in
We got to live life,
Give in to begin
We gotta love like no one else
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Just sitting on top,
Sitting on top of the world

Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, ooh

Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world

Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world

(Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world)
