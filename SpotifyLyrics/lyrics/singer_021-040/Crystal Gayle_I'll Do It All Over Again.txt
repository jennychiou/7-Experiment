Was I right? Was I wrong?
A little too weak-- a little too strong?
Was it him? Was it me?
Oh I guess I'll never know

First you're up, then you're down
Oh but the world keeps turning around
Ain't it hard... to find...
Something to hang on to

But I know, that my heart will mend
And I know, that I'll smile again
I'll be back, on my feet and then,
I'll do it all over again

Some you lose, some you win
They say that's the way it's always been
First you laugh, then you cry
Oh but I guess that's life

So you live, and you learn
And never look back at the bridges you burn
And you change, somehow
Oh I'm a little bit wiser now

But I know, that my heart will mend
And I know, that I'll smile again
I'll be back, on my feet and then
I'll do it all over again

But I know, that my heart will mend
And I know, that I'll smile again
I'll be back, on my feet and then
I'll do it all over again
I'll do it all over again!
