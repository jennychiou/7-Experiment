It's a gift, it's a blessing
An all-white wedding, a peaceful morning in June
It's a crown
It's a calling
A rain shower falling, a new born yawning that's new

It's a smile, it's a space
It's a familiar place
It's a long embrace with someone you love
It's a bright sleepy thought
It's a standing applause
It's a meaningful cause that could save us all

This love's got stronger with time
And this love's reciprocal
We've had it all and have it all to find

I love you more than life
I love you more than life
And what we are is written in these lines
I love you more than life
More than life

It's a white empty shore
It's a New Year's roar
It's a curtain call on the greatest show
It's the start of a new day
It's getting your own way
It's your child's 1st birthday
Now get some sleep

It's that feeling in your heart
It's one drink too far
It's a brand new car, you can drive yourself
It's when visitors have gone
It's your favorite song
It's a sing-along so let's sing along

This love's got stronger with time
And this love's reciprocal
We've had it all and have it all to find

I love you more than life
I love you more than life
And what we are is written in these lines
I love you more than life
More than life

It's a fun ride fair
It's the wind in your hair
It's the oldest chair that's so comfortable

It's a light, it's a healing
That Friday feeling
The last journey home
Wanna let the whole world know

I love you more than life
I love you more than life
And what we are is written in these lines
I love you more than life
More than life
