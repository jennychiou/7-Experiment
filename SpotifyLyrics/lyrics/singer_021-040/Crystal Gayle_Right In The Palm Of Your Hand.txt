A willin' woman, a willin' man
A five room house and a wedding band
Believer, believer

Once it begins, you know it don't take long
Till like two people in a heartbreak song
And wonder, I wonder

Ain't it just like a woman
Yeah, and ain't it just like a man
Chasin' the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand

We can't take back those things we said
So, we watch it pass in separate beds
Changing, we're changing

Too little love and too much pride
You won't give in and neither will I
We're like children, children

Ain't it just like a woman
Yeah, and ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand

Feet on the floor, holding my head
Sitting alone on the edge of the bed
I been thinking, thinking

Trying to find where we went wrong
Just turned around Lord and you were gone
It's over, oh, it's over

Ain't it just like a woman
Yeah, and ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand

Ain't it just like a woman
Oh, and ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow, looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand

Right in the palm of your hand
Right in the palm of your hand
