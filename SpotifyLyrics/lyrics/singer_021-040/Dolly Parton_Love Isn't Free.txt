The neon lights of a movie marquee
Says the show today is Love Is Free
And inside a boy and a girl on a date
Their folks are gone away they're gonna stay out late
A little later on in a lover's lane
They park in the dark with their hearts in flames
He says oh baby go along with me
I need you so and love is free

In a simple little room in a Chatanooga home
For girls that need a friend and are all alone
She waits for a letter that never comes
From a boy that won't admit what he's done
She had to leave school 'cause she couldn't stand the shame
Her daddy said she ruined the family name
Her mama cries herself to sleep at night
That's no way to start a young girl's life

Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love

In an orphanage home a sad little girl
Six years old and all alone in the world
She knows by now what they never say
That she once had a mom but she gave her away
People come to visit but don't choose Marie
She cries at the door nobody loves me
And somewhere a boy doesn't care at all
That her tear at night stains her little rag doll

Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
No matter what they say look who's paying for love
