Sweet, sweet were the lips that kissed me 
Warm, warm were the arms that held me 
Sweet, sweet were the lips, yeah 
Warm, warm were the arms 
But so, so filled with the love you gave me 
Wet, wet were the tears on my face 
Long, long were the hours I cried them 
Wet, wet were the tears, yeah 
Long, long were the hours 
But so, so filled with the love you gave me 
My friends tried to tell me 
That mis'ry would a-happen to me 
But back in school I didn't believe 
That misery and pain a-would-a ever get to me, oh 
Since, since you've been gone, gone away 
I cry, cry lonely teardrops night and day 
Since, since you've been gone, yeah 
I cry, I cry lonely teardrops 
All so, so filled with the love you gave me 
Sweet, sweet were the lips that kissed me 
Warm, warm were the arms that held me...
