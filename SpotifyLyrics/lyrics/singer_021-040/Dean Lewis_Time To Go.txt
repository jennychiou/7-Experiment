You've been sleeping the whole night
Tried my best to not even call
'Cause if you're not here by my side
I'll come knocking at your door
Did you mean what you had said?
'Cause it's fucking with my head
I'd give it all to get you back
But now I know, I know you don't mean that

'Cause I can feel you when I'm low
I can feel you when I'm high
And struggle to sleep when I'm alone, I'm alone

'Cause I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause nothing is true, and no one is you
And nothing at all ever feels right
You're caught in my head, you're stuck in my mind
I'm trying my best to say my goodbyes, oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it's time to go, I think it's time to go
It's time to go

You always saw the best in me
Although I know I could make it hard
But you could always make me laugh
You'd take the good, you'd take the good from all the bad

And now I can feel you when I'm low
I can feel you when I'm high
And struggle to sleep when I'm alone, I'm alone

'Cause I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause nothing is true, and no one is you
And nothing at all ever feels right
You're caught in my head, you're stuck in my mind
I'm trying my best to say my goodbyes, oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it's time to go, I think it's time to go

'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
No, I won't let you, no, I won't let you
No, I won't let you down

'Cause I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause nothing is true, and no one is you
And nothing at all ever feels right
You're caught in my head, you're stuck in my mind
I'm trying my best to say my goodbyes, oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it's time to go, I think it's time to go
