There must be something fishy going on 
You said you were goin' on a fishin' trip with some old friend 
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten 
Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home 
I think there's something fishy goin' on 

I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line 
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind 
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along 
So there must be something fishy goin' on 

There's something fishy goin' on 
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on 
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone 

Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone 
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on 

I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt 
I don't think you're a fisherman, honey 
I think you're a flirt 
Well if you're goin' fishin' then why don't you bring 'em home 
I think there's something fishy goin' on 

There's something fishy goin' on 
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on 
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone 

Yes, you can bet there's something fishy goin' on
