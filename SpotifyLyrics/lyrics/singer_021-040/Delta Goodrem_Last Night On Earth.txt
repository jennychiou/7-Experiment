It's the last night on earth
Before the great divide 
My hands are shaking
Time was never on our side 
And there's no such thing
As a beautiful goodbye 
As an ordinary day
I prayed for you a thousand times 

It's never enough 
No matter how many times I tried to tell you
This is love 

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
And if tomorrow falls asleep
Can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth

A penny for your thoughts 
A picture so it lasts 
Let's knock down the walls of immortality 
Your fingers on my skin
Only you can hear my fear 
Only you can help me heal 
I see forever with you here 

It's never enough
No matter how many miles stand between us
This is love 

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
And if tomorrow falls asleep
Can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth

It's never enough 
No it's never enough 
It's never enough

The afterglow 
The horizon line 
The shadows fall 
Will you still be mine 
Will you still be mine 
Will you still be mine I ask 

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
And if tomorrow falls asleep
Can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth
