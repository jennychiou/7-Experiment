Mad is the captain of Alpha Centauri
We must be out of our minds
Still we are shipmates bound for tomorrow
And everyone here's flying blind

Oh, we must believe in magic
We must believe in the guiding hand
If you believe in magic
You'll have the universe at your command

Mad is the crew bound for Alpha Centauri
Dreamers and poets and clowns
Bold is the ship bound for Alpha Centauri
Nothing can turn it around

Oh, we must believe in magic
We must believe in the guiding hand
If you believe in magic
You'll have the universe at your command

La-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da

Oh, we must believe in magic
We must believe in the guiding hand
If you believe in magic
You'll have the universe at your command

La-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da

Oh, we must believe in magic
We must believe in the guiding hand
If you believe in magic
You'll have the universe at your command

La-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da

Oh, we must believe in magic
We must believe in the guiding hand
If you believe in magic
You'll have the universe at your command
