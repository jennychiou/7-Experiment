There's no room for me
I'm a girl left alone
With fields all around me
I feel so alone
I could tell my story for whom it will urge
But I know I cannot sleep if there's no room for me

I'm a girl left alone
There's no hope for me
I'm tossed and thrown
Like a ship on the sea
There was a mistake and now I will sink
For those that still love me
I must go this way

I hear the great story
Of the great eternity
Where souls can be happy
And I will be free
I know I will suffer
In this world eternity
But in heaven I wonder
If there'll be room for me
