Every time I think about you,
I get chills along my spine.
It's a feeling I'm not used to,
Can't believe you're really mine.

Other love's so complicated,
Broken hearts and twisting minds.
Then you came and I'm elated,
So unlike the other times.

It's so pure it's almost sacred.
Simply put, it feels divine.
I just love you pure and simple,
Pure and simple and sublime.

Don't it seem we've spent a lifetime.
Looking for that perfect love.
Like a dream we finally found it,
Pure and simple, well good for us.

It's so pure it's almost sacred.
Simply put, it feels divine.
I just love you pure and simple,
Pure and simple, sweet and fine.
I just love you pure and simple,
Can't believe you're really mine.
