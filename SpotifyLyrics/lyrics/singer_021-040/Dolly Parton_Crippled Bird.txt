A broken heart like a broken wing 
It must have its time to mend 
I am like a crippled bird 
In hopes one day to fly again 
I loved you so and I was faithful 
I cared more than words could say 
But love is cruel and life is hateful 
Now you've gone and flown away 

Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure 
Slow to heal, but quick to cry 
Fragile as a sparrow's feather 
Crippled bird too blue to fly 

Oh, the loss is cold and shameful 
And the grief so deep and sharp 
There is nothing quite as painful 
As a true blue broken heart 

Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure 
Slow to heal, but quick to cry 
Fragile as a sparrow's feather 
Crippled bird too blue to fly 

Fragile as a sparrow's feather 
Crippled bird too blue to fly
