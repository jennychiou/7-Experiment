Please release me, let me go 
'Cause I don't love you anymore 
And to live without love is a sin 
So release me and let me love again 
I have found a new love, dear 
And I'll always want him near 
His lips are warm while yours are cold 
So release me, my darlin' let me go 

Oh please release me, let me go 
'Cause I just won't love you anymore 
And to live together we both know is a sin 
So release me, release me and let me love again 

Oh, please, please, please, please 
Release me, let me go 
'Cause I, I don't love you anymore 
And to live together is a sin 
So release me and let me love again 

Oh, please release me, let me go 
I don't love you anymore 
And to live together is a sin 
So release me and let me love again
