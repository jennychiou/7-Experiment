Thumbing for a ride by the edge of the road 
With a brown paper bag to hold my clothes 
But tonight I'm going home where I belong 
If the good lord's willing and the creek don't rise 
And if my luck holds out, and I catch me a ride 
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I should be home 
This big city ain't no kind of place 
For a country girl with a friendly face 
If you smile people look at your funny, they take it wrong 
They laugh at my talkin' and clothes I wear 
They put me down and they call me square 
But tonight I'm going home where I belong 

I'm goin' back to the people I love 
Back to the place that I dream of 
It's true that there's no place like home sweet home 
The one I want to see the most 
Is the boy who begged me not to go 
When the sun goes down tomorrow
