If I cross your mind, please let me cross it slowly 
Let me stop and reminisce with you for a while 
And if I cross your mind, please remember only good things 
Think of me as happiness if I cross your mind 
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind 
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find 
Please stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind 
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind 

If you must hide my memory when you're with someone else 
Then make mine very special when you're by yourself 
For only in a memory can one turn back the time 
To lovely tender moments that linger in your mind 

There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind 
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find 
Won't you stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind 
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind 
Think of only good things if I cross your mind
