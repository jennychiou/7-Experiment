All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore

You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher

Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again

I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
