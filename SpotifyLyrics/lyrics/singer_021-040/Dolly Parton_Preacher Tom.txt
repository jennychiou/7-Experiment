Preacher Tom, your friends are many
And your good deeds are a plenty
And I know that God is plenty proud of you
'Cause you've directed your attention
Towards a bright and shining mansion
God promise to the ones that pay their dues

So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on

Your smile is like the sunshine bringing warmth and joy to others
And love controls your understanding heart
And the message that you spread is just like water to the thirsty
A beacon that keeps shining through the dark

So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on

So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
