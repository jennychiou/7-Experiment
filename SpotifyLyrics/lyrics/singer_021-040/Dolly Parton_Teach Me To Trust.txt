Maybe because it's too good to be true 
Maybe because I want it so much 
Maybe I fear you don't really mean it 
For I feel I'm never enough 
But I want you more 
Than I ever wanted 
Anything I can recall 
But something inside 
Keeps saying you'll hurt me 
Do I dare to trust it at all 

Teach me to trust 
Darling you must 
Or else I'll go out of my mind 
When I'm not near you 
I always fear you 
Have somebody else on the line 

Is it a fear 
Or is it a knowing 
A jealousy born out of truth 
'Cause I watch you flirt 
And it's how you embrace 
Them with your eyes 
That say I could lose 

Teach me to trust 
Make me feel loved 
Tell me I've no need to fear 
Just make me feel safe 
Whatever it takes 
Tell me what I need to hear 

'Cause I need to feel 
Important and special 
Your cherished and only true love 
And sometimes I think 
I'll die from this feeling 
If you don't teach me to trust 

Can't you reach me 
And teach me to trust
