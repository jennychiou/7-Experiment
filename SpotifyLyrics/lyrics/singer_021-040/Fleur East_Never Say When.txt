Ask for 24 hours, I need more than a day
Shortcut to the finish line, I don't play that game
If I ask for a minute, need 61 seconds
Can't deny you make me selfish
Forever should be jealous

Let's go missing, I'll take what you're giving
All day, all night
I'll never

Never say when, can't get too much anything else
Never say when, when it comes to us don't wanna say no
No, no, no, don't turn it up
No, no, don't turn it down
No, no, until I tell you to stop
Give me all you got
Never say when, when it comes to us don't wanna say no

If I ask for the ocean, don't give me the sea
I'ma leave that door open, you don't need no key
I need more than a moment, give me a lifetime
I need a love that leaves me breathless
Forever should be jealous

Let's go missing, I'll take what you're giving
All day, all night
I'll never

Never say when, can't get too much anything else
Never say when, when it comes to us don't wanna say no
No, no, no, don't turn it up
No, no, don't turn it down
No, no, until I tell you to stop
Give me all you got
Never say when, when it comes to us don't wanna say no

Can't get too high, can't get too low
They say there's levels to this
I wouldn't know
We ain't to sky, we ain't to flow
They say there's levels to this
I wouldn't know

Never say when, can't get too much anything else
Never say when, when it comes to us don't wanna say no
No, no, no, don't turn it up
No, no, don't turn it down
No, no, until I tell you to stop
Give me all you got
Never say when, when it comes to us don't wanna say no.
