Another sleepless night alone
Crazy from this jealousy
I heard you call her on the phone
Watched you shave and dress and leave
Walked the floor and watched the clock
Knowing that you ain't missing me
Imagination runnin' hot
And you're right where you wanna be

Do you think I'm made of stone
Do you think it doesn't hurt
When you leave me here alone
Leaving me to think the worst
And when you're out there in her arms 
'Til the wee hours of the dawn
Do you think it's all a joke
Can't you see my heart is broke
Do you think I'm made of stone

I'm just barely gettin' 'round
Don't know how I'm getting by
All our friends I meet in town
They just can't look me in the eye
They all know you're runnin' 'round
Like me, they don't know what to do
God, I hate their sympathy
But I just can't turn loose of you

But do you think I'm made of stone
Don't you know my pain is real
It's the worst I've ever known
Just stayin' at an even keel
Oh, what am I supposed to do
While you cheat and carry on
I should leave, I know I should
I just only wish I could
Do you think I'm made of stone

Oh, it cuts me like a knife
You have stripped me of my pride
What am I supposed to do
While you cheat and carry on
Do you think it's all a joke
Can't you see my heart is broke
Do you think I'm made of stone

Another sleepless night alone
