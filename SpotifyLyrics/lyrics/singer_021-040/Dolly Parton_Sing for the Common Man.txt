You may not know me now but I have been around
You'll never see my name on any pages
I'm just a common man the fool who understands
The pain you go through when life takes you under

So sing for the common man a song for the common man
He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow
He will survive he will survive

You may not know my mother my sisters and my brothers
Yet everyone has given for the other
You know the working man he builds what others plan
So everyone of us should sing his story

So sing for the common man...

Day after day he keeps working away in offices factories and farms
Year after year he sheds tear after tear but he will provide he will survive

So sing for the common man...
Sing for the common man...
Sing for the common man...
