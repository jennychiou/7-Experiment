You've got a face for a smile, you know
A shame you waste it
When you're breaking me slowly, but I've
Got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through

I've got a paper and pen
I go to write a goodbye
And that's when I know I've
Got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through

Oh, I'm going my own way
My faith has lost its strength again
And oh, it's been too hard to say
We're falling off the edge again

We're at an end
We're at an end

Maybe you'll call me someday
Hear, the operator say the numbers no good
And that she had
A world of chances, for you
She had a world of chances, for you
She had a world of chances
Chances you were burning through
Chances you were burning through
Chances you were burning through
Oh

You've got a face for a smile, you know
