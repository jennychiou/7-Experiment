Hey Bruce,
Untie my noose
Open up a bottle of
Whatever you choose
You see the naked truth
It's only truth sometimes
'Cause if you're looking for lies
That's what you gonna find

I gotta free my soul from the troubles of lately
Follow my heart wherever it takes me
Let it flow on by like a piece of driftwood

Just a piece of driftwood (yeah)
A piece of driftwood

You win some, you lose some
And some that you win, you really lose
You get some, you give some
You trade a little piece of your youth (oh)
It's nothing makes me happier than singing the blues
Set my big brown hat to my black pointed shoes
(I'm thinking about it)

Like a piece of driftwood
A piece of driftwood
Ooh, like a piece of driftwood

Ain't no mind to these troubles on the telephone lines
The sun still shines, we got board and grind
It's time to start baking, got no time to decline
The earth awakes you, yes, the simple pleasures of mine
Yours if you want them, you got the day
Find wealth in the living and you'll never be grave
A piece is missing from your puzzle
It's the piece that you need
It's place of mind you gonna find meditate by the sea
Be free with all trees in all the air that you breath (yeah)
They can't take away your soul but they can take all your pride
Slow ride, gonna sleep in the forest tonight
You gonna, you gonna sleep in the forest tonight
Are you gonna sleep in the forest?
'Cause

Ooh, la-like a piece of driftwood
La-la-la-like a piece of driftwood (yeah, oh)
