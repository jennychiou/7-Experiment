You called me out and taught me tough
With love, with love
You fought my flaws, my teeth, my claws
With love, with love
'Cause every time I'm slipping away from myself
You're the one that moves me like nobody else

'Cause when I'm down and I'm done
And I'm coming unplugged
When I'm ready to fall
You're the one always holding me up
With love

Oh no no

Your tongue won't tie, you'll always find
The truth yeah you do
But still you smile despite the lines
I drew for you

'Cause every time I'm slipping away from myself
You're the one that moves me like nobody else. Oh no

'Cause when I'm down and I'm done
And I'm coming unplugged
When I'm ready to fall
You're the one always holding me up
With love

Love, Love, Love, Love

When I'm down, when I'm coming unplugged. no. (Oh)
You're always there with love (Love)
When I'm done, love
When I'm out, when I fall
You're always always always always there

When I'm down and I'm done
And I'm coming unplugged
When I'm ready to fall
You're the one always holding me up

When I'm down and I'm done
And I'm coming unplugged
When I'm ready to fall
You're the one always holding me up
With love
