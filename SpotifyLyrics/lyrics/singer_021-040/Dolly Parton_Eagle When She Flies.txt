She's been there, god knows she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she knows how to dish it out, or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers, still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies

A kliederscope of colours, you can toss her round and round
You can keep her, in your vision, but you never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother, she's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies

Gentle as the sweet magnolia, strong as steel her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder, she's a leading post of life
She hurts deep, and when she weeps, she's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
She's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Oh bless her lord
She's an eagle when she flies
