Put it off until tomorrow 
Wo-wo 
You've hurt me enough today 
You say our love is over 
That you have found another 
You say you're going away 

But leave me tomorrow 
Wo-wo 
You've hurt me enough today 

You've hurt me enough today 
I can't believe the words you say 
But I must accept the fact 
You won't be coming back 

Oh stay 
Stay just one more day 
Loneliness isn't far away 

Put it off until tomorrow 
Wo-wo 
You've hurt me enough today 
Put it off until tomorrow 
Wo-wo 
You've hurt me enough today
