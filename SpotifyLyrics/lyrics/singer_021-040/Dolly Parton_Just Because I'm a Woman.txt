Just because, just because
Just because, I'm a woman

I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry if I'm not the woman
You thought I'd be
Yes I've made mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse that yours
Just because I'm a woman

So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the hurt
You might have cause somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

A man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well that's a different situation
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

Well I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I am just the victim of a man who let me down
Yes, I've made mistakes
But you listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
