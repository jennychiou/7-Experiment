An acre of diamonds I'd offered to you
A solid gold mansion an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd feel oh so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold...
But teardrops aren't pennies and heartaches aren't gold
