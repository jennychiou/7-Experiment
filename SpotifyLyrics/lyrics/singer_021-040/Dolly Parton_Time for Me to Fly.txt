I've been around for you 
Been up and down for you 
But I just can't get any relief 
I've swallowed my pride for you 
I've lived and lied for you 
But you still make me feel like a thief 
You've got me stealing your love away 
'Cause you never give it 
Peelin' the years away 
And we can't relive it 
I make you laugh and you make me cry 
I believe it's time for me to fly 

Time for me to fly 
I've got to set myself free 
Time for me to fly 
That's how it's got to be 
I know it hurts to say goodbye 
But it's time for me to fly 

You said we'd work it out 
You said that you had no doubt 
I thought we were really in love 
Oh but I'm tired of holding on 

To a feeling I know is gone 
I do believe I've had enough 
I've had enough of the falseness 
Of a worn out relation 
Enough of this jealousy and intoleration 
I wonder why I even try 
I believe it's time for me to fly 

Time for me to fly 
I've got to set myself free 
Time for me to fly 
That's just how it's got to be 
I know it hurts to say goodbye 
But it's time for me to fly 
Time for me to fly 

Time for me to fly 
I got to set myself free 
Time for me to fly 
That's just how it's got to be 
I make you laugh and you make me cry 
I believe it's time for me to fly 
Time for me to fly 
That's how it's got to be 
I know it hurts to say goodbye 
But it's time for me to fly
