I'm lookin' for a way to get out there's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
We stopped loving a long time ago and now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend there's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
There's no use for us to live a lie 
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
