If there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love, when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me

The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep a-thinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me

And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me, then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me

And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me
