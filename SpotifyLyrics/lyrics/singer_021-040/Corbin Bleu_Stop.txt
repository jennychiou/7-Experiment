I'm chillin' with my guys
We steppin' out tonight
Hit a spot that's looking fly
You know we keep it tight
Hop on my ride it's on
I got my Vans and my shades on
Hit the floor, I hear my song
And then I see this girl
And I'm like hold up wait
I see the most beautiful (this) girl, in the world
Turning heads all up in this party
She's dancing to the beat
I nearly lost my feet
Standing trying to keep the groove
But what I really need to do is...

Stop
I know I oughtta stop
But I don't wanna stop
Your making it hard for me
Stop
I know I oughtta stop, (stop)
But I don't wanna stop
Your making me loose the beat
You got me girl...

You know I must admit
This girl she got me spent
I never lose my groove
But this girl, she's got moves
Not to mention her eyes

They've got me mesmerized
And I gotta make her mine
And keep her dancin' by my side
Hold Up wait
I love the way she takes it to the floor
I'm like wow
Turning heads all up in this party
She's dancing to the beat
Still trying to catch my feet
I gotta keep it smooth
But what I really need to do is:

Stop
I know I oughtta stop
But I don't wanna stop
Your making it hard for me
Stop
I know I oughtta stop, (stop)
But I don't wanna stop
Your making me loose the beat
You got me girl...

She's doing it again
Making me lose again, she knows what she's doing to me
She's winking her eye
I think right now is the time to make her mine

(Get em J)... yeah you gotta play it smooth
Knowing you and her I can tell you the right two
I'm looking at her now and I can tell that she likes you
And you can make it work if you put on
The right moves, so chance, go on and take those hands, ...... , she wanna
Move and be closer to you, so go on over there and do what ever you do

Stop. (stop, I know I oughtta)
I know I oughtta stop, (but I don't wanna, (stop!))
But I don't wanna stop
Your making it hard for me... (the things you do to me)
Stop. (so stop)
I know I oughtta stop, (but I don't wanna)
But I don't wanna stop
Your making me loose the beat
You got me girl...
(I know I oughtta, but I don't wanna stop)
(My body's telling me to stop)
(But my heart is saying don't you stop)
(Ha! hey girl)
