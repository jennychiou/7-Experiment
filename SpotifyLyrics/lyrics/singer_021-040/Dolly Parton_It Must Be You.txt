Just like the tide goes with the sea 
We belong together, you and me 
Just like the dawn followed by day 
We'll always be together 
And that's just how it will stay 

It must be you that's always walking in my dreams 
It must be you who'll always be right next to me 
So when you find yourself alone 
Just think of me and I'll be there 
Must be you by my side the whole way through 

Just like the fresh white winter snow 
Our love is pure and it will always grow 
And when we're in those autumn years 
Together, we'll look back, but we won't shed a single tear 

It must be you that's always walking in my dreams 
It must be you who'll always be right next to me 
So when you find yourself alone 
Just think of me and I'll be there 
Must be you by my side the whole way through 

When you find yourself alone 
Just think of me and I'll be there 
Must be you by my side the whole way through
