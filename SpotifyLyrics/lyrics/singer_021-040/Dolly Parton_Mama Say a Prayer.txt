The bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see. 
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me. 
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be. 
So mama, when you pray tonight, say a special prayer for me. 
I miss your tender good-night kiss
Of love and understanding. 
The good-night kisses I get now,
Are cruel and so demanding. 
So mama when you pray tonight,
And while you're on your knees, 
Mama say a special prayer for me. 

The nights get cold and lonely when you're faraway from home, 
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong. 
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me, 
So mama when you pray tonight, say a special prayer for me. 

I miss your tender good-night kiss
Of love and understanding. 
The good-night kisses I get now,
Are cruel and so demanding. 
So mama when you pray tonight,
And while you're on your knees, 
Mama say a special prayer for me.
