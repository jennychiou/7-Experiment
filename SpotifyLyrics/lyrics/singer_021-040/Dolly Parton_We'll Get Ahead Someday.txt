We'll get ahead someday
We'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up
And we both cut down
We'll get ahead someday

Well I get up early an' work hard all day
Listen to the troubles of my friends
But I don't realize 'til I get home
What an awful shape we're in

The car's wore out
The kids need shoes
Got a bill from the doctor today
The landlord said you'll get out tomorrow
If you don't get me some pay

We'll get ahead someday
We'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up
And we both cut down
We'll get ahead someday

The paper says there's a sale downtown
I gotta have some money today
Well there's things at home
That ain't never been used
You bought last bargain day

Well you go out on Saturday night
You spend too much money on wine
Well I work hard all week long
And I gotta have a little fun sometimes

We'll get ahead someday
We'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up
And we both cut down
We'll get ahead someday
