Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip horray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of a taxi
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxie's

When a Broadway baby says goodnight
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't say goodnight
Until the dawn

Goonight baby
Goodnight
The milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Let's call it a day

Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hi-de-hi and boop-a-doo
The lullaby of Broadway
The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock-a-bye your baby round
Till everything gets hazy
Hush-a-bye, I'll buy you thing and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Goonight baby
Goodnight
The milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Let's call it a day

Listen to the lullaby of old Broadway

Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Let's call it a day
Listen to the lullaby of old Broadway

Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Let's call it a day
