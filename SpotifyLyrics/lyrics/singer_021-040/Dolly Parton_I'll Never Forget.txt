Sweeter than honey, as soft as a sigh 
Gentle as snowflakes but warm as July 
This is the way I remember your kiss 
If I live forever, I'll never forget 
Misty as morning, as blue as the sky 
Reflections of Heaven in your loving eyes 
Eyes that said more than your words ever did 
And if I live forever, I'll never forget 

If I live forever, I'll never forget 
It's you that I'm wanting to spend my life with 
Do I still love you? The answer is yes. 
And if I live forever, I'll never forget 

Two loving arms that I felt welcomin' 
Arms that I've run to again and again 
How do you erase sweet memories you miss 
If I live forever, I'll never forget 

Sad circumstances that stood between us 
Wouldn't let us share our precious, sweet love 
Do you remember, do you feel like this? 
If I live forever, I'll never forget 

If I live forever, I'll never forget 
It's you that I wanted to share my life with 
Do I still love you? The answer is yes. 
And if I live forever, I'll never forget 
Do you remember, do you feel like this? 
If I live forever, I'll never forget
