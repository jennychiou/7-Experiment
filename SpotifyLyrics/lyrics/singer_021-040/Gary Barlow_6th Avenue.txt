A strip of sunlight, a moment in time
A change of direction
Your life in a face, your words on a page
Now your heart needs no protection

In one conversation I saw what I'd always believed in
In just a few words I could tell it would hurt
To leave you without knowing when I might see you again
So again I depend on the unknown

I've travelled six thousand miles thirty thousand feet just to see you
Where is the danger?
I have my return ticket ready with nothing to lose
Has time taken leave of our senses
Or has sense taken leave of our time
If all of my life has been leading to this rendezvous
Let it happen on 6th Avenue

I've always lived life in search of surprise
I keep my eyes open
What you can't control you can't leave alone
So don't choose be chosen

Now your tongue can't say the questions 'cause you know the answers
In just a few words I could tell it would hurt
To leave you without knowing when I might see you again

I've travelled six thousand miles thirty thousand feet just to see you
Where is the danger?
I have my return ticket ready with nothing to lose
Has time taken leave of our senses
Or has sense taken leave of our time
If all of my life has been leading to this rendezvous
Let it happen on 6th Avenue

On any other day I'd have taken Broadway
In a New York minute
To think I could have missed you

I've travelled six thousand miles thirty thousand feet just to see you
Where is the danger?
I have my return ticket ready with nothing to lose
Has time taken leave of our senses
Or has sense taken leave of our time
If all of my life has been leading to this rendezvous
Let it happen on 6th Avenue

I've travelled six thousand miles thirty thousand feet just to see you
Where is the danger?
I have my return ticket ready with nothing to lose
Has time taken leave of our senses
Or has sense taken leave of our time
If all of my life has been leading to this rendezvous
Let it happen on 6th Avenue
