This is not at all like me I never thought that I could be
So overcome by anyone like this
But you caught me by surprise caught me before I realize
Now I am lost forever in your kiss
So take me if you want me love me if you will
(For you have all control of me) and I am yours until
(Till you say that you don't want me oh I hope that never will be)
For I'm lost forever in your kiss

You're on my mind constantly oh and this is all so new to me
And when you reach for me I can't resist
For I've become a part of you and I'll do anything you want me to
For I am lost forever in your kiss
So take me if you want me...
