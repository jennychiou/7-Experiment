Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul
Oh, oh, oh lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

It's not enough, to say I want ya
'Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I ha... have just been questioning yeah

If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul
Oh, oh, oh lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be

All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal

If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
