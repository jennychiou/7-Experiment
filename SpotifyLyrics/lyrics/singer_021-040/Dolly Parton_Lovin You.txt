If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes an' lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
An' I have been wonderin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin', had I not found you
Well I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walkin' on the avenue findin' you
Well, I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you

Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
An' he can't even get me up and on my feet

When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
Couldn't quite barely concieve of you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you

If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
I just close my eyes an' lovin' you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you
