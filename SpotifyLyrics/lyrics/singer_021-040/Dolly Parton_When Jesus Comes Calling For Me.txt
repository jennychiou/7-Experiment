When I was a child I recall and old man; everybody loved old Zeke 
He was all alone, his family was gone; one day he said to me 

I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks 
Some glad day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me 
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, maybe one day next week 
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when He comes calling for me 
When Jesus comes calling for me 

When I die don't grieve and cry 
Lordy, don't feel sorry for me 
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day 
When Jesus comes calling for me 
When He comes calling for me 


I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family 
Or I might be plowing in the field down yonder, just old Muley and me 
Wherever I am, whatever I'm a doing, some sweet day I'll see 
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when Jesus comes calling for me 
When He comes calling for me 

When I die just close my eyes 
And lay me 'neath the willow tree 
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day 
When Jesus comes calling for me 
When Jesus comes calling for me 

I'm just sittin' here watchin' for Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks 
Some sweet day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me 
When He comes calling for me
