You can dance
Every dance with the one that gives you the eye
Let 'em hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that holds your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So, darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
I love you oh so much

You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
Till it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You must tell her no

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh, darlin', save the last dance for me

You can dance
Every dance with the one that gives you the eye
And let 'em hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that holds your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms your gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh, darlin', save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
