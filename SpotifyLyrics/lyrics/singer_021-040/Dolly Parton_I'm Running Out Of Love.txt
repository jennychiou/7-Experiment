I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away

How long did you think you could keep on doing me wrong
How long did you think I'd stay quiet and take it
The love I had for you is almost gone
And I ain't gonna let you take my heart and break it

I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away

You come and go just any time you want to
And you never bother to tell me where your going
And I wonder if there's anything you don't do
Someday you'll pay for the wild seed your sewing

I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away
