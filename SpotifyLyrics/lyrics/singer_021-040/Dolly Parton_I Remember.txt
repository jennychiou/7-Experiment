I remember, I remember 
I remember momma and daddy most of all 
I remember meadows and fields of golden wheat 
I remember song birds and sugar cane so sweet 
I remember lots of things that often I recall 
But I remember momma and daddy most of all 

I remember ginger bread my momma used to bake 
I remember home-made toys that Daddy used to make 
Yes, I remember many things that often I recall 
But I remember momma and daddy most of all 

I remember momma and daddy most of all 
In our little country home they filled with love 
I remember momma and daddy most of all 
And all the things they did to make life happier for us 
Yes I remember lots of things that often I recall 
But I remember momma and daddy most of all 

I remember candy that daddy used to bring 
I remember songs my momma used to sing 
Oh I Remember many things that often I recall 
But I remember momma and daddy most of all 

I remember momma and daddy most of all 
And how they taught us children right from wrong 
I remember momma and daddy most of all 
How they used to hope and pray they'd live to see us grown 
Oh I remember many things that often I recall 
I remember momma and daddy most of all 

I remember, I remember 
I remember momma and daddy most of all 
Most of all
