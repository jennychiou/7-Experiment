At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I'd still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
How I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
And I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
How I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if he's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
How I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
