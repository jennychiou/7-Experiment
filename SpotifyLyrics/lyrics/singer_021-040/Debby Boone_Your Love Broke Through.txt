Like a dreamer who is trying to build a highway to the sky
All my hopes would come tumbling down
And I never knew just why
Until today, when you pulled away the clouds
That hung like curtains on my eyes
Well, I've been blind all these wasted years
And I thought I was so wise
But then you took me by surprise

Waking up from the longest dream, how real it seemed
Until your love broke through
I've been lost in a fantasy that blinded me
Until your love broke through

All my life I've been searching for that crazy missing part
And with one touch, you just rolled away
The stone that held my heart
And now I see that the answer was as simple
As my need to let love in
And I'm so sure I could never doubt
Your magic touch again
It's like the power of the wind

Waking up from the longest dream, how real it seemed
Until your love broke through
I've been lost in a fantasy that blinded me
Until your love broke through

Waking up from the longest dream, how real it seemed
Until your love broke through
I've been lost in a fantasy that blinded me
Until your love broke through
