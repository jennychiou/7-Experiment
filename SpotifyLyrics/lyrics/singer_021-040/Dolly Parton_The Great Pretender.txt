Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender 
Pretending that I'm doing well 
My need is such I pretend too much 
I'm lonely but no one can tell 
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender 
Adrift in a world of my own 
I've played the game but to my real shame 
You've left me to dream all alone 

Too real is this feeling of make-believe 
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal 

Oh yes I'm the great pretender 
Just laughin' and gay like a clown 
I seem to be what I'm not, you see 
I'm wearin' my heart like a crown 
Pretending that you're still around 

Too real is the feeling of make-believe 
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal 

Oh yes I'm the great pretender 
Just laughin' and gay like a clown 
I seem to be what I'm not, you see 
I'm wearin' this old heart like a crown 
Pretending that you're still around 

But I know what I am 
I am the great pretender
