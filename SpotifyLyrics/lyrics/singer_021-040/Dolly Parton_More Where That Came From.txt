I've been through hell and half of Louisiana 
Lookin' for a man like you 
I know you could have any woman you want 
And I know you've had a few 
I know I've got some stiff competition 
They ain't got nothin' on me 
'Cause I've got something that you've been missin' 
I practice what I preach 

'Cause I wanna be your lover 
I wanna be your friend 
And I wanna be your full-time woman 
Closer than your kin 
I wanna be your satisfaction 
Be your number one 
And just when you think I can't love you any better 
Well, I have just begun 
'Cause there's more where that came from 
There's more where that came from 

And I want your clothes in my closet 
My name on your mail 
And I want my love to be your faucet 
Drinkin' from an endless well 
I want your kids to call me Mama 
I want you to call me Hun 
I wanna be the one you love and honor 
When it's all been said and done 

'Cause I wanna be your lover 
I wanna be your friend 
And I wanna be your full-time woman 
Closer than your kin 
I wanna be your satisfaction 
Be your number one 
And just when you think I can't love you any better 
Well, I have just begun 
'Cause there's more where that came from 
That's right, there's more where that came from 

Oh, I wanna be your lover 
I wanna be your friend 
I wanna be your full-time woman 
I'm gonna get under your skin 
'Cause I wanna be your satisfaction 
Be your number one 
And just when you think I can't love you any better 
Well, I have just begun 
There's more where that came from 
That's right, there's more where that came from 

Yes, I wanna be your full-time woman 
I wanna be that, I wanna be that 
Oh, I wanna be your lover, lover, lover 
I wanna be that, I wanna be that 
And I wanna be your satisfaction 
I wanna be that, I wanna be that
