Sometimes you look at you,
And the face you see's,
Not who you want to be.
Everybody's got it together,
Or at least that's what it seems.

You try to be like,
Why you try to be like?
Whatever they like,
I know what it feels like.
Can't keep you up all night,
Don't let them tell you,
How to live your life.

And if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.

Yeah if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suit.

Uh-oh, uh-oh, funny how it looks,
When you switch the roles.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, never know what's,
Underneath until it gets exposed.

And if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suit.

She may look better than you,
But, come on, she's vain,
She doesn't have the brains
His pants hang lower than yours,
But he stumbles when he,
Tries to run, no.

You try to be like,
Why you try to be like?
Whatever they like,
I know what it feels like.
Can't keep you up all night,
Don't let them tell you,
How to live your life.

And if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.

Yeah if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suit.

Uh-oh, uh-oh, funny how it looks,
When you switch the roles.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, never know what's,
Underneath until it gets exposed.

And if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suit.

Who cares what,
Everybody's thinking? No, no.
Who cares? Sometimes,
It's cool to be uncool.

Who cares if their,
Ship is sinking?
It really doesn't matter,
'Cause only you know,
What's good for you.

And if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.

Yeah if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suit.

Uh-oh, uh-oh, funny how it looks,
When you switch the roles.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, never know what's,
Underneath until it gets exposed.

And if they make you feel ugly,
Just imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
Imagine everybody,
In their birthday suits.
