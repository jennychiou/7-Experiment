I fought a battle, I fought a war
I felt the rain on my face
Sometimes to find what you're looking for
You've got to learn from your worst mistakes
I made a wish on a satellite
That I mistook for a star
Guess when you build up to break down
You find out who you really are

How did it all get so heavy
I used to stand up so tall
There's only so much I can carry
Before I fall
And they tell me "girl you're so lucky"
"You've got the world in your hands"
But you know the world gets so heavy
You don't understand
And that's heavy

Just tell me what's the intention
Is it to fall in love
I tried to find a connection
Between how it is and how it was
I made a promise I couldn't keep
Another story to tell
You swear to god that you know me
But I don't, don't even know myself

How did it all get so heavy
I used to stand up so tall
There's only so much I can carry
Before I fall
And they tell me "girl you're so lucky"
"You've got the world in your hands"
But you know the world gets so heavy
You don't understand
And that's heavy

Sometimes I lay awake in bed at night
I close my eyes and all I see is see the dreams I used to dream about when I was younger
I wonder where I took the path of no return
I might've lost my way a hundred times but no I never ever lost the hunger 
Oh and I know every cut and every stitch and every scar
I know they've gotten me this far, they only made me tough, they made me stronger
The limit's hard to break but I just can't get off the phone
I offer days when I was free and I would listen on the phone

It all got so heavy
I used to stand up so tall
There's only so much I can carry
Before I fall
They tell me "girl you're so lucky"
"You've got the world in your hands"
But you know the world gets so heavy
You don't understand
And that's heavy, heavy
