Thinking back in time when I had you to lose
Those were the days baby you were truth
And nothing you could do would ever change that
You riding with me, me riding for you
We followed our hearts don't forget what they do
But somewhere down the line I left you hanging
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend, I'll never break your heart again

'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I'd take you as you are, are, are, are, are

You know me like inside and out, how I feel
Nothing more nothing less you're the real
I wanna take this time to thank you baby
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend, I'll never break your heart again

'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I'd take you as you are, are, are, are, are

So let it be known now
You're queen to my throne now
It's you at all times
I'll never reject you
I'll love and respect you
'Cause you're my lifeline
Only thing on my wishlist
You love and forgiveness
For that I will climb
(Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times)
Why would I fight it?
I know that it's right when you're holding my hand
I knew when I saw you
That God was just giving me a second chance
I'll climb every mountain
And scream at the top of my lungs that I'm yours
You know that I'm yours

'Cause I, I will always love you
(I will always love you)
Baby I could never judge you
(I could never judge you)
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
(Darling I will always love you
I will always love you)
Baby I could never judge you
I'd take you as you are, are, are, are, are
