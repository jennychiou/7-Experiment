Merciful and gracious 
So slow to anger 
In pity plenteous 
Oh, the Lord is so good 

He'll not always chide us 
Nor let His anger or wrath 
Abide upon us 
No, the Lord is too good 

He is not rewarding me 
According to my iniquity 
Nor treating me after my sin 
No, I'll enter in 

To His throne room with boldness 
When I've a hunger 
For His forgiveness 
For the Lord is my good 

He is not rewarding me 
According to my iniquity 
But if I happen to sin 
He'll bid me to come in 

To His own room with kindness 
For my intercessor 
Is the gentle Jesus 
Who delivers us for our good 

So sing hallelujah 
To the Lord 
The Lord is so good
