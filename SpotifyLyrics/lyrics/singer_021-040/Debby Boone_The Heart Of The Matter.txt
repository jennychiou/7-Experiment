Old friend
When did it happen?
When did your eyes become dazzled by the world
Instead of lit up by His light? (See I. John 1:5)

Choices
Too many voices
Was there one too many battles
So you gave up on the fight?
Was your love for Him a decision of the mind to be changed in time?
Was it really not a committed walk but rather a display of religious talk?
I need to know
Because I love you so

If you really knew Him the way that I knew Him
You would never walk away
If you truly understood what His love was all about
You would never shut Him out
All this talk of Jesus working in our lives is nothing more than childish chatter
If we don't allow Him past the mind to penetrate with depth into the heart of the matter
Into the heart of the matter

Old friend
How did it happen?
How did you take all the life He had to give and then let your praises die?
Confusion
Rising delusion
Did you give your heart to busyness and never question why?
When you discovered that from you He wanted more did you close the door?
Did you decide to do it on your own and then pridefully you'd walk alone?
I need to know
Because I love you so

If you really knew Him the way that I knew Him
You would never walk away
If you truly understood what His love was all about
You would never shut Him out
All this talk of Jesus working in our lives is nothing more than childish chatter
If we don't allow Him past the mind to penetrate with depth into the heart of the matter
Into the heart of the matter

How do spiritual eyes go blind?
When does deception infiltrate the mind?
I know it's hard to comprehend
But the choice is still yours, old friend
Don't let it happen

If you really knew Him the way that I knew Him
You would never walk away
If you truly understood what His love was all about
You would never shut Him out
All this talk of Jesus working in our lives is nothing more than childish chatter
If we don't allow Him past the mind to penetrate with depth into the heart of the matter
Into the heart of the matter
