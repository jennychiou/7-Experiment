I am confident, but I still have my moments
Baby, that's just me
I'm not a supermodel, I still eat McDonald's
Baby, that's just me

Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same in the La La Land machine

Who said I can't wear my Converse with my dress
Well baby, that's just me
Who said I can't be single and have to go out and mingle
Baby, that's not me... No No

Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same in the La La Land

Tell me do you feel the way I feel,
Cause nothing else is real in the La La Land appeal

Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same in the La La Land machine
Well I'm not gonna change in the La La Land machine
I will stay the same in the La La Land
Machine, Machine, Machine

I won't change anything in my life
(I won't change anything in my life)
I'm staying myself tonight
(I'm staying myself tonight)
