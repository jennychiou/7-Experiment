You ready? I don't think you are, you what?
We come to party

Turn it on, turn up the song
Here's how it's done, we come to party
Break it down, come on, move around
Let's scream and shout, let's get it started

Don't you wait, you know the way
That's how we play, yeah, we can't stop it
Here we go, let's start the show
We're on a roll, we come to party

Ready over here? Let me hear you loud
What you wanna do now?
Ready over there? Wanna hear you scream
Tell me what you need

Gonna start it up when you're right on time
We're about to hit the lights
Count down to one
Let's start the celebration

Turn it on, turn up the song
Here's how it's done, we come to party
Break it down, come on, move around
Let's scream and shout, let's get it started

Don't you wait, you know the way
That's how we play, yeah, we can't stop it
Here we go, let's start the show
We're on a roll, we come to party

It's gettin' kinda hot and it's not just me
The crowd is going crazy
Dancin' till we drop, gotta work that groove
Show a little attitude

Get off the wall, just have a good time
Leave the world far behind
Count down to one
It's time for celebration

Turn it on, turn up the song
Here's how it's done, we come to party
Break it down, come on, move around
Let's scream and shout, let's get it started

Don't you wait, you know the way
That's how we play, yeah, we can't stop it
Here we go, let's start the show
We're on a roll, we come to party

Everybody now dance all night
Never have to stop
Let me hear you say one more time
Let's turn it on

Everybody now let it all out
Gotta do your thang
Everybody let's rock the house
'Cause we come to party

We come to, we come to party
So let's get it, let's get it started
We come to, we come to party
So let's get it, let's get it started

Turn it on, turn up the song
Here's how it's done, we come to party
Break it down, come on, move around
Let's scream and shout, let's get it started
