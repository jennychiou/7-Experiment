Come and listen you fellows 
So young and do fine 
And seek not your fortune 
In the dark, dreary mines 
It will form as a habit 
Seep in your soul 
'Til the blood in your veins 
Runs as black as the coal 

There's many a man 
That I've known in my day 
Who lived just to labor 
His whole life away 

Like a fiend with his dope 
And a drunkard his wine 
A man will have lust for 
The lure of the mine 

It's dark as a dungeon 
Damp as the dew 
The danger is double 
And the pleasures are few 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines 
It's dark as a dungeon 
Way down in the mine 

I hope when I'm gone 
And the ages shall roll 
My body will blacken 
And turn into coal 

Then I'll look out the door 
Of my heavenly home 
And I'll pity the miners 
A-diggin' my bones 

It's dark as a dungeon 
Damp as the dew 
The danger is double 
And the pleasures are few 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines 
It's dark as a dungeon 
Way down in the mine 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines 
It's dark as a dungeon 
Way down in the mine
