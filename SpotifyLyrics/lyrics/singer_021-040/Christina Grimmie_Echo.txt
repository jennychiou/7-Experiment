Boy I don't understand your drama
Thought we were having fun, should I not have called you
Should I be sorry for being me?
I'm just trying piece together your mind
You and me were cool when I saw you last night
Now we're in a state of emergency
Oh yeah

You say you have half a dozen
But I don't care
'Cause I know they ain't nothing like me, babe
Ain't nothing like me baby
Hey!

You keep telling me lies, you know I find out
I don't keep it inside
I just let it echo, echo
Ricochet like an echo, echo
Hey!
I won't lay down and die
It's over this time
XO goodbye
Can you hear it echo, echo
Ricochet like an echo, echo

You can keep all the hearts you're holding
'Cause I don't need you where I'm going
I'll just be myself and live for me
Yeah-yeah
Hey!

You say you have half a dozen
But I don't care
'Cause I know they ain't nothin' like me, babe
Ain't nothin' like me baby
Hey!

You keep telling me lies, you know I find out
I don't keep it inside
I just let it echo, echo, echo
Ricochet like an echo, echo
Hey!
I won't lay down and die
It's over this time
XO goodbye
Can you hear it echo, echo?
Ricochet like an echo, echo
(XO goodbye)

I know, I know you know
There's more than what you show
You can't hide, you can't hide it, no
The truth will echo
Hey!
I know, I know you know
There's more than what you show
You can't hide, you can't hide it, no
The truth will echo
Hey!

I won't lay down and die
No, no, no
XO goodbye
I let it echo (echo, echo)
I let it echo (yeah!)

You keep telling me lies, you know I find out
I don't keep it inside (telling me lies baby!)
I just let it echo, echo
Ricochet like an echo, echo (Ricochet let it echo)
Hey!
I won't lay down and die
It's over this time
XO goodbye
Can you let it echo, echo?
Ricochet like an echo, echo
XO goodbye

I know, I know you know
There's more than what you show
You can't hide, you can't hide it, no (You can't hide it babe)
The truth will echo
Hey!
I know, I know you know
There's more than what you show
You can't hide, you can't hide it, no
The truth will echo
