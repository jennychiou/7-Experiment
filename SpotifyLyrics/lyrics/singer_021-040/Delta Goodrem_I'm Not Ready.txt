I am broken
There's a stranger on the phone
Something's missing,
From seven years ago
You tell me baby don't you cry anymore
That's the past and not what we've become
But I know

I am shaking
Not a breath left to breathe
All this sadness so cold
That I can't speak

Look me in the eyes
You know it's okay that we didn't make it forever
Come hold my hand,
Hold on to this last minute we have together

I'm not ready to say goodbye
You and God both know
All the years I've tried and if it's over
Give me the strength to go
'Cause I know I'm never gonna be
I'll never be ready
To say goodbye, to you

Your bags are all packed
They're waiting at the door
But it's hard to imagine
You won't live here anymore

I'm scared of tomorrow
And the emptiness to come
But I've changed for the better
Since I've known your love

So look me in the eyes
You know it's okay that we didn't make it forever
Come hold my hand,
Let's hold on to this last minute we have together

'Cause I'm not ready to say goodbye
You and God both know
All the years I've tried and if it's over
Give me the strength to go
'Cause I know I'm never gonna be
I'll never be ready
To say goodbye, to you
I'll never be ready

And even if we tried
We would end up right back to this place together
This was not a lie
What we had will always be a real love forever

'Cause I'm not ready to say goodbye
You and God both know
All the years I've tried and if it's over
Give me the strength to go
'Cause I know I'm never gonna be
I'm not ready to say goodbye
You and God both know
All the years I've tried and if it's over
Give me the strength to go
'Cause I know I'm never gonna be
I'll never be ready
To say goodbye, to you
I'll never be ready
