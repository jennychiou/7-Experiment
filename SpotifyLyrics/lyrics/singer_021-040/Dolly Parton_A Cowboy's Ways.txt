Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do 
He'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose 
What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool 
She swears she never knew but always needed to 
But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose 
Even love can't change the things he ought to change the most 
And it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees 
Makin' apologies but she loves him desperately 

Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet 
So he'd know all the perfect lines to say 
And have some great romantic way to show it 
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day 
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor 
To sweep her up and carry her away 
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her 
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways 

"I love you" and "I'm sorry" are words that just don't come 
Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue 
But his eyes keep tellin' her "you know I love you anyway 
No matter what I say or what I never say" 

Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet 
So he'd know all those fancy lines to say 
And have some great romantic way to show it 
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day 
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor 
And sweep her up and carry her away 
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her 
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways 

His ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer 
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways 

He's just a fool that must defend his honor 
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways
