I didn't cry all of these tears just to have you show up here again 
I didn't lie awake all these nights to have you come walking back in 
I didn't change my whole life around, not to mention my dreams and my plans 
To have you come back with your same ol' act thinking that I'll understand 

Time and tears have mended the pain 
Healed all the hurt and changed everything 
Time and tears I'm happy to say 
Time and tears have washed it away 
Time and tears have washed you away 

I didn't think that I would survive the day that you walked out on me 
I truly was more dead than alive; and the pain, Lord I couldn't believe 
I asked God to please have mercy on me and to ease all the feelings I felt 
Then I saw the light, now I'm more than alright; 

I'm much better off since you left 
Time and tears have mended the pain 
Healed all the hurt and changed everything 
Time and tears have carried me through 
Time and tears got me over you 
Time and tears and somebody new 

Time and tears is all that it takes 
To mend shattered hopes or a heart when it breaks 
Time and tears have carried me through 
Time and tears got me over you 
Time and tears and somebody new 

Time and tears, time and tears got me over you 
Time and tears, got me over you
