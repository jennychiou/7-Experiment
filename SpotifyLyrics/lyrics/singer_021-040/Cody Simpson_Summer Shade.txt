Hey nice to meet you, what's your name?
I saw you walkin' up my way girl
Oh maybe we could spend the day
We could lay my jacket out on the sand
And do something

I'm sorry that my hair's so wet
I'm sorry girl but have we met before?
It's not something that I'd forget
Come on baby, take my hand
Let's do something

'Cause the sun is setting soon
Honey honey
I won't let you walk alone
And when the sun comes up tomorrow
I'ma walk you home

All I wanna do is hang with you
Every day in summer shade
All I wanna do is be with you
Be with you, oh yeah
All I wanna do is hang with you
Every day in summer shade
All I wanna do is be with you
Be with you, oh yeah, yeah yeah

I just wanna be your man
I just wanna see you dancin'

Watch the fireworks tonight ooh yeah

'Cause the sun is setting soon
Honey honey

And when the sun comes up tomorrow
