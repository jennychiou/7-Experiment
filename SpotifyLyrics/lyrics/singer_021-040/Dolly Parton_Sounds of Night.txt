Hear the evening breezes start to blowing
See the evening shadows start to come
Listen to the nightbirds start their singing
Now the sounds of night have just begun

A lonely hootowl cries out in the darkness
For its mate that's nowhere to be found
Then a lonesome whippoorwill strats calling
Their lonely voices fill the night with sound

Hear the church bell ringing in the distance
What a mournful sound so late at night
Wonder why the darkness makes it sound so lonesome
Listen to the lonely sounds of night

The darkness seems to whisper in the silence
Your love is gone but things will be all right
Still my lonely heart cries through the darkness
Listening to the lonely sounds of night

Hear the church bell ringing in the distance...
