She was given the world
So much that she couldn't see
And she needed someone
To show her who she could be

And she tried to survive
Wearing her heart on her sleeve
But I needed you to believe

You had your dreams I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
La da da da da

She was scared of it all
Watching from far away
She was given a role
Never knew just when to play
And she tried to survive
Living her life on her own
Always afraid of the thrown
But you've given me strength to find hope

You had your dreams I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide

She was scared, unprepared
Left in the dark, falling apart
I can survive with you by my side
We're gonna be all right (we're gonna be all right)
This is what happens when two worlds collide

You had your dreams I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
La da da da da

You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
When two different worlds collide
