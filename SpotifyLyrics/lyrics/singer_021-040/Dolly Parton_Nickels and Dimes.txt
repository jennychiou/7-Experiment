I used to stand on a corner when I was a child
And I'd play my guitar and sing as the people went by
The sidewalks were crowded but I'd just sing louder 'cause I didn't mind
Just spending my time, spinning my rhymes and singing for nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
I'd brighten their day as they go on their way and they'd brighten mine
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
I knew that someday in my own special I'd repay all their nickels and dimes

I recall the sidewalk each night as I stand on the stage
As I play my guitar and sing for the people who paid
'Cause I finally made it to what they all call the big time
But I still remember I still owe some nickels and dimes

Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on the corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes

Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on a corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes

Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on a corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes
