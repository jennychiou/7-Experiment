When I left I left walkin' wounded 
I made my escape from the rain 
Still a prisoner of hurt 
I had months worth of work 
Just freein' my mind of the pain 
I had hours of sittin' alone in the dark 
Listenin' to sad songs and comin' apart 
Lord knows I made crying an art 
Woe is a slow healing heart 

A slow healing heart dyin' to mend 
Longin' for love lonely again 
But when the spirit is broken 
And the memories start 
Nothin' moves slower 
Than a slow healing heart 

How I prayed for blind faith to lead me 
To places where I'm not afraid 
Now I'm doin' fine both in body and mind 
Some hurts take longer to fade 
But there's a part of my feelings ever on guard 
Against looks that are tender and words that are hard 
'Cause I still remember those cutting remarks 
Oh it's painful a slow healing heart 

A slow healing heart dyin' to mend 
Longin' for love lonely again 
When the spirit is broken 
And the memories start 
You know nothin' moves slower 
Than a slow healing heart 
Nothin' moves slower 
Than a slow healing heart
