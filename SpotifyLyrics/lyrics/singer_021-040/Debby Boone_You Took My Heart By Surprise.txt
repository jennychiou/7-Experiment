Just when I thought my heart had no feeling, 
And life had no music, no rhythm or rhyme 
You came along, like a warm summer wind, 
You lifted me up when I needed a friend 

You gave me a song 
You took all my sorrows 
And brushed all the tears from my eyes 
Now your love has filled me, 
It's warmed me and thrilled me, 
You took my heart by surprise 

I hear your name and without a warning, 
I find that I'm singing a new kind of song 
Your kind of loving is so hard to find 
But you help me leave all my failures behind 

You gave me a song 
You took all my sorrows 
And brushed all the tears from my eyes 
Now your love has filled me, 
It's warmed me and thrilled me, 
You took my heart by surprise 

You took my heart by surprise
