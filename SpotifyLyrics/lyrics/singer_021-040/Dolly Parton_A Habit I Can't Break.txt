Loving you isn't good for me
You keep my tears flowing
If I left you I couldn't stay gone
So there's no use in going

Loving you is a habit I can't break

I haven't found a way yet
But I've been trying
To stop loving you but I can't wait
There's no use in lyin'

Loving you is a habit I can't break

Loving you is a habit I can't break
I've been loving you much too long now
To change the way I feel
So I might as well get used to these heartaches

Loving you is a habit I can't break
