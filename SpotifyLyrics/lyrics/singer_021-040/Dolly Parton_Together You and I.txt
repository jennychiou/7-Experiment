My love for you is deeper than the depth of any ocean
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night
As constant as the sun in its journey to the heavens
That's why we will always be together you and I

Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine
Paint a pretty rainbow in the sky
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
That's why we will always be together you and I

Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river as lasting as forever
That's why we will always be together you and I

Together you and I can stop the rain...
Together you and I can stop the rain...
