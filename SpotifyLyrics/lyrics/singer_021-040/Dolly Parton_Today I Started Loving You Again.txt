Today I started loving you again 
I'm right back where I've really always been 
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend 
And then today I started loving you again 

What a fool I was to think I could get by 
With only these few million tears I've cried 
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come 
And the crying time for me had just begun 

Peace train sounding louder 
Ride on the peace train 
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah 
Come on peace train 
Peace train holy roller 
Everyone jump on the peace train 
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah 
Come on peace train 

Peace train sounding louder 
Ride on the peace train 
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah 
Come on peace train 
Peace train holy roller 
Everyone jump on the peace train 
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah 
Come on peace train 

Today I started loving you again 
Today I started loving you 
Today I started loving you again
