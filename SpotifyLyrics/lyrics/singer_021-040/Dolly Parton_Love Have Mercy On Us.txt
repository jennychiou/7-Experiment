I wasn't looking for you when I found you
I just turned and I saw you there
And I was so lonely and lost when I found you
And I needed somebody to care
And it had been so long since I had been happy
Or needed or wanted or loved
And now that I've found you let my arms surround you
Oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us don't let it be wrong
For there is nothing to live all alone
And now that you're mine may love treat us kind
Oh love have mercy on us
Oh what must we do with this love for each other
Is it wrong to love one so much
I want to be with you and oh how I miss you
Oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us don't let it be wrong...
