The man I loved ran a salesman route 
Selling goods from house to house 
Now I knew my mama would never stand 
For me stepping out with no traveling man 
Mama bought things that he was a'selling 
But mama didn't know and I sure wasn't telling 
That behind her back I was making plans 
To meet somewhere with that traveling man 
Oh the traveling man was a good bit older 
But a girl needs arms to hold her 
Mama didn't know 'cause I didn't told her 
But mama wouldn't understand 
Me stepping out with a traveling man 

Mama didn't allow me a'going courting 
And I'd tell lies that I reckon I oughtn't 
Oh but she'd a'give me the back a' her hand 
If she'd a'seen me with that traveling man 
So I tell my mama that I reckon I oughta 
Go to the spring and fetch us some water 
What mama didn't know is I had a plan 
To meet down there with that traveling man 

Now I make plans to run away 
With that traveling man on a Saturday 
Well Saturday's here and here I stand 
And there goes my mama with that traveling man 

Oh that traveling man was a two-time lover 
He took my love then he took my mother 
But I didn't know 'cause mama didn't told me and I don't understand 
My mama running off with my traveling man 

Mama, you know you oughtn't a'done that 
You just like my daddy 
He run off before I ever knowed him 
You done run-off with my traveling man 
And I really don't think I ever knowed you either 
Oh there goes my mama with my traveling man 
And I'm really gonna miss that traveling man 
Mm-hm
