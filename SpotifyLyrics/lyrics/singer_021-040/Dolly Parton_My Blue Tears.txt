Fly away from my window little blue bird 
Fly as far as you can away from here 
And let not your song fall upon my ear 
Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears 
For the one that I have loved 
He has left me and gone 
An' I'm in no mood for to hear your sad song 

Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine 
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here 
Oh, trouble me not 
Go ye elsewhere 
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears 

For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away 
An' I'm in no mood for the sunshine today 

Go spread your blue wings 
Go light your blue sky 
An' I'll shed my blue tears
