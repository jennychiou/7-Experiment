Like the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you

It was springtime when I found you like the flowers
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I could see our love was changing
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done

Like the weather your heart changes...

Came the spring again you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old misery

Like the weather your heart changes...
