Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play 
They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way 
Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own 
The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home 
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick 
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit 
These are all my possessions all I have to my name 
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame 

I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl 
Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world 
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name 
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame 

A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick 
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit 
These are all of my possessions, all I have to my name 
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame 

Yes a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame
