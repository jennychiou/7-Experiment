You're gentle body lying here so close to me 
As you move your hand slowly across my face 
You're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me 
What a love in the way I see you 
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning 
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue 
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty 
Like the love in the way I see you 

I compare it with the beauty of the dawning 
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue 
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty 
What a love in the way I see you
