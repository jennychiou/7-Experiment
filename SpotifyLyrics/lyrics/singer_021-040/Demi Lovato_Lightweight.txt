The slightest words you said
Have all gone to my head
I hear angels sing, in your voice
When you pull me close
Feelings I've never known
They mean everything, and leave me no choice

Light on my heart
Light on my feet
Light in your eyes
I can't even speak
Do you even know, how you make me weak?

I'm a lightweight, better be careful what you say
With every word I'm blown away, you're in control of my heart
I'm a lightweight, easy to fall easy to break
With every move my whole world shakes, keep me from fallin' apart

Make a promise please
You'll always be in reach
Just in case I need, you're there when I call (Here when I call)
This is all so new
Seems too good to be true
Could this really be, a safe place to fall?

Light on my heart
Light on my feet
Light in your eyes
I can't even speak
Do you even know, how you make me weak?
Oh oh

I'm a lightweight, better be careful what you say
With every word I'm blown away, you're in control of my heart
I'm a lightweight, easy to fall easy to break
With every move my whole world shakes, keep me from fallin' apart

Keep me from falling down, drowned in your love
It's almost all too much
Handle with care
Say you'll be there

I'm a lightweight, better be careful what you say
With every word I'm blown away, you're in control of my heart
I'm a lightweight, easy to fall easy to break
With every move my whole world shakes, keep me from fallin' apart

Keep me from fallin' apart
Keep me from fallin' apart
Oh oh
Fallin' apart
