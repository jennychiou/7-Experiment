I worked late but you didn't wait up
My bones ache and I'm clearing the place up
Sometimes I don't even know why I care
I sit down and take off my make up
I lay down but you don't wake up
Sometimes I wonder if you know I'm there

I can't remember the last time you told me I'm beautiful
And I can't remember the last time you said anything at all

I'm a woman
A woman with a heart
And that is of your own
I'm not some girl who don't know what she wants
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
'Cause being just your woman is not enough
It's not enough

Now I hope that you don't wake up
When it's too late to make up
You'll be the one that's alone and that's sad
In time you'll find somebody
The truth is she'll never be me
That's when you're gonna miss what we had

When all I really needed to hear was "you're beautiful"
And I - all I really needed to hear was anything at all

I'm a woman
A woman with a heart
And that is of your own
I'm not some girl who don't know what she wants
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
'Cause being just your woman is not enough


I'm not your friend who only needs you sometimes
And if I'm your lady you've gotta treat me like

I'm a woman
A woman with a heart
And that is of your own
I'm not some girl who don't know what she wants
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
'Cause being just your woman is not enough

(A woman needs your heart)
I said I need your heart
(A woman needs your all)
I said I need your all
(A woman needs your everything)

I'm a woman

(And I need to be touched)
I said I need your love
(And I need to be loved)
I said I need your touch
And that is I'm you're everything

I'm a woman
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
