It was fun
Playin' with knives
Until a blade
Stuck in the left side of my chest, surprise
I'm not down again
I turned the page
This story's mine
No more watching the world from my doorstep
Passin me by (passin me by)

And I'll just keep changin these colors
Colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place that I was
I was, I was, I was

But if somebody tells me
I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say no way
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearing them all say
I'll go back to my old ways
Not going back to my old ways

Not going back to my old ways
(Not going back to my old ways)

Now I know
What's good for me
All that I need
And I can't wait to sink my teeth in and take another bite
And the best part about it
Is I'm the only who can do somethin' about it
I fill the well with some water it's overflowing
Black into gold
Who knew it'd be so bright without the blindfolds

And I'll just keep changin these colors
Colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place that I was
I was, I was, I was

But if somebody tells me
I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say no way
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearing them all say
I'll go back to my old ways
Not going back to my old ways

Not going back to my old ways
(Not going back to my old ways)

Every scar
The flames burnt them all
I'm not afraid to fall
I'm spiraling, I'm spiraling
Past the stars
I'm not burning out
I'm not afraid to fall
I'm not afraid anymore

And I just keep changing my colors
I'm not in the same place that I was, I was
(And the best part about it)
(Is I'm the only who can do somethin' about it
(I fill the well with some water it's overflowing)
Black into gold
Who knew it'd be so bright without the blindfolds

And I'll just keep changin these colors
Colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place that I was
I was, I was, I was

But if somebody tells me
I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say no way
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearing them all say
I'll go back to my old ways
Not going back to my old ways
