Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way
Tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love have its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts

Let's cast all our worries and heartaches aside
Forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone

Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend
That we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
