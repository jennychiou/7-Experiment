I can't seen to learn not to love you
You get to me every time
You're someone I just can't say no to
And you sure put a change in my mind

Here I go down that wrong road again
Goin' back where I've already been
Even knowin' where it will end
Here I go down that wrong road again

Though I've seen the way that you're weavin'
You and your soft easy lines
Before I stop to think I'm believin'
And I'm fallin' for you one more time

Here I go down that wrong road again
Goin' back where I've already been
Even knowin' where it will end
Here I go down that wrong road again

Here I go down that wrong road again
Goin' back where I've already been
Even knowin' where it will end
Here I go down that wrong road again
