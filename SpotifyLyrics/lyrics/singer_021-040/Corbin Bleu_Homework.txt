Yeah, Corbin Bleu

Each time I see you I stop, you're lookin' so hot
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
I can't think, you got me hypnotic
Is it that cute little walk or that smile when you talk?
I can't fake this, I can hardly wait
Either way you got excited

Ain't nobody takin' care of you, apparently not
Let me show you, girl, what I can do, Corbin Bleu used to
Hold back, lay low, step back, but now
Till I find out everything about you, girl, I swear

I'm putting in homework till I get to know you
I'm putting in homework, I'll study your every move
I'm putting in homework till I know everything you like
I'm gonna push, gonna mash, gonna grind
I'm on the grind till I know it, I'm putting in homework

Do my best to chill but can't wait until
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
O' clock, tick, tick, tick, tock
If you feel it don't make me wait another moment of another day, yeah
Don't wait another day

Ain't nobody takin' care of you, apparently not
Let me show you, girl, what I can do, Corbin Bleu used to
Hold back, lay low, step back, till now
I'll find out everything about you, girl, I swear

I'm putting in homework till I get to know you
I'm putting in homework, I'll study your every move
I'm putting in homework till I know everything you like
I'm gonna push, gonna mash, gonna grind
I'm on the grind till I know it, I'm putting in homework

Yeah, uh, even though you work, even though you stressin'
You know you like how she keeping you guessing
You gotta see it through when I think you probably knew
She's so cute when she smiles 'cause it shines through

See we don't got no shame
I'm puttin' in my work till I get your name
Till I see my perfect picture coming true
I can never rest till I'm holding you

One, two, adore you, wanna hold you
Three, four, I put in work till I'm yours
Five, six, now I can hear the clock tick
Seven, eight, maybe late, baby, I don't want to wait

Don't want to wait, uh, another whole day
Tell me what you want, what you need, I will stay
You know to me you will always be perfect
And that's why I'm

I'm putting in homework, ain't nobody takin' care of you
I'm putting in homework, let me show you, girl, what I can do
I'm putting in homework, homework, homework, homework
I'm on the grind till I know it, I'm putting in homework

I'll find out everything about you, girl, I swear
I'm putting in homework
I'll find out everything about you, girl, I swear
I'm putting in homework, homework, homework, homework
I'm on the grind till I know it, I'm putting in homework
