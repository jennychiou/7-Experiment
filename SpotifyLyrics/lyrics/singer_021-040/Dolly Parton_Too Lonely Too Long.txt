No matter how you're tempted 
Don't say yes to me 
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on 
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone 
I've been too lonely too long 
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me 
Before I let myself do something wrong 
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman 
I've been too lonely too long 

Oh please don't take advantage of the situation 
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation 
When you're used to being loved 
It's hard to live alone 
I've been too lonely too long 
I've been too lonely too long
