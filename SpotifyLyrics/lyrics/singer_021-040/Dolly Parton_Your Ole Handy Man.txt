I have to mow the lawn 
And I have to wash the car 
And I'd just like to know 
Just who you think you are 
I'm gettin' tired of wagging 
That old heavy garbage can 
Your woman's gettin' tired 
Of being your ole handy man 

I have to run your water 
And I have to wash your back 
And I have to scrub the tub 
After you have had your bath 

You're as helpless as a baby 
But I love you, understand 
I'm just gettin' tired 
Of being your ole handy man 

Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man 
Now I know you've got ten fingers 
But where's your helpin' hand 
I've just made a decision 
I've stood all I'm gonna stand 
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man 

I do everything for you 
You never help yourself 
An' I think I'd die from shock 
If you raised a hand to help 
Well, I'm not gonna keep it up 
That's what you got planned 
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man 

Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man 
Now I know you got ten fingers 
But where's that helpin' hand 
I've just made a decision 
I've stood all I'm gonna stand 
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
