Sometimes I go walkin' through the fields
Where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used-to-be
And the flowers still grow
But they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you
And the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that
Or do I cross your mind

Do you ever wake up lonely
In the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darlin'
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back
Into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love
We shared when you were with me, do you darlin'
I just wonder do I cross your mind

Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
How often I long for those two lovin' arms
That once held me so gentle and close

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all
Or do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up lonely
In the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darlin'
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back
Into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love
We shared when you were with me, do you darlin'
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh, do I ever cross your mind
