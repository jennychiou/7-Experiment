Loneliness found me one time too many and I cheated I cheated on you
But I'd give my soul now if only I hadn't but you see what loneliness can do
It seems that you're gone so much from me
And I try to find things to do while you're gone
But I get so lonesome from stayin' at home and it's hard to enjoy things alone
Loneliness found me just one time too many and I cheated yes I cheated on you
But I'd give my life now if only I hadn't but you see what loneliness can do
Loneliness found me
