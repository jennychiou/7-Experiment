I'm a brave little soldier 
I must be bold and strong 
A brave little soldier 
And I must carry on 
I'm a brave little soldier 
A brave little soldier 
I'm a brave little soldier 
I must fight, I must win 
I'm a brave little soldier 
Through hell and back again 
I'm a brave little soldier 
A brave little soldier 
Per rum, pum, pum 
Per rum, pum, pum 
Per rum, pum, pum, pum, pum 

Ye though I am marching through the valley filled with fear 
My steps are sure and sturdy and my aim is straight and clear 
The enemy is stalking me just waiting for the kill 
Like David slewed Galiath 
I will claim this battle field 

I'm a brave little soldier 
I must do what I can 
I'm a brave little soldier 
And I must take a stand 
I'm a brave little soldier 
A brave little soldier 

Marching, marching onward 
Searching out the light of truth 
I did not start the war 
But it's a battle I can't lose 
Faith will be my armor 
And love my sword and shield 
I must defeat the enemy 
I will, I will, I will 

A brave little soldier 
I must be bold and strong 
A brave little soldier 
And I must carry on 
A brave little soldier 
A brave little soldier 

I'm a brave little soldier 
A brave little soldier 
Brave, little soldier
