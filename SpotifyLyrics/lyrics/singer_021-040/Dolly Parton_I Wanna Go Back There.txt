There's a place in my mind that's suspended in time 
When we were happy in love 
Days warm and sweet, and the night so complete 
Then life was perfect for us 
It was just you and I, only love in our eyes 
Not a sign of a tear on our face 
No sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain 
Before something else took its place 
Oh, I wanna go back there 
Back to the time there was no doubt you cared 
Back to the time love was tender and fair 
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there 

Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do 
I wanna go back there 
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do 
I wanna go back there 

Do you think if we tried we could put life aside 
And see if we might make it back 
I know in my heart what we had at the start 
I believe it could still be like that 

Oh, I wanna go back there 
Away from these heartaches, these worried and cares 
Back to the time love was tender and fair 
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there 

Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do 
I wanna go back there (say you care) 
I wanna go back, I wanna go back 
I wanna go back there 
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do 
I wanna go back there 
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do 
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
