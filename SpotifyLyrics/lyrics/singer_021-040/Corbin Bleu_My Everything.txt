Something's happen when, when you don't expect
All of a sudden now you're falling in love
Baby that's the case between you and me
Never thought I'd be saying this but you're the one

I trip, I fall, you're there through it all
And most times I really don't deserve it, no
You give, never take, you bend, never break
I know it's soon but I want you to know

If I'm the sun then you're the moon
The day ain't done if I don't see you
If I'm an eagle then you're my wings
You keep me up, you are my everything

Maybe it's too soon to be telling you
But I really don't care I'll put it all on the line
'Cause I never felt and I've never seen
Nobody like you that I can't get off my mind

I trip, I fall you're there through it all
And most times I really don't deserve it, no
You give, never take, you bend, never break
I know it's soon but I want you to know

If I'm the sun then you're the moon
The day ain't done if I don't see you
If I'm an eagle then you're my wings
You keep me up, you are my everything

You're my everything, you're my everything
All that I'll ever need, you're my everything

If I'm the sun then you're the moon
The day ain't done if I don't see you
If I'm an eagle then you're my wings
You keep me up, you are my everything

If I'm the sun then you're the moon
The day ain't done if I don't see you
If I'm an eagle then you're my wings
You keep me up, you are my everything
You are my everything
