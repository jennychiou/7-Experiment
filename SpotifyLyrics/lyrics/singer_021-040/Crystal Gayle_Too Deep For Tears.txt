Now every since you went away
I've overheard some people say
She's taking it well I hear

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears

Like on the day my daddy died
Mommy never even cried
Just whispered in my ear

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears

Ever since you said goodbye-ye
How I wish that I could cry
How I wished and wished that I
Break down way down inside

But maybe I will find away
And I get over you someday
But I know that may take years

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears
Some just goes too deep for tears
