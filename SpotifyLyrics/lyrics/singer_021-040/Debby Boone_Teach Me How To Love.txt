More and more I see how Your love never fails 
It perseveres when I have strayed and comes in measures far beyond what I'm deserving 
A heart that beats with great compassion 
Pulsing our lives with hope 
A love that just begins 
Where human loving ends 
Love I want to know 

Teach me how to love the way that You love 
To pour out my life for another 
Teach me how to care the way that You care 
I've got so much to learn from You 

More and more I hear what You're saying to me 
Though I speak with tongues of angels and I have not love I'm just a crashing cymbal 
A love that's kind and not self-seeking 
Keeping no record of wrongs 
And when the music's gone 
Love goes on 
Remembering the songs 

Teach me how to love the way that You love 
To pour out my life for another 
Teach me how to care the way that You care 
I've got so much to learn from You 

Love believes all things 
Love endures all things 
Gives and doesn't count the cost 
Will not rush to anger when it's crossed 

Let me share the Father's love with His daughter 
Let me show the Father's heart to His son 
Let me share the Father's love with His children 
Let me show the Father's heart to everyone 

Teach me how to love the way that You love 
To pour out my life for another 
Teach me how to care the way that You care 
I've got so much to learn from You
