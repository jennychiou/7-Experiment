How many times can you say that it's over...
How many ways can you say
That I'll love you forever more
How many times can you
Make love with your lover...
And how many lies and many lies
Can we live with ourselves
Yeah yeah
How many times will you change your religion
How many Gods do you ask for the answers that
Grow in yourself
What has to break before you make a decision
Cause you never know which way to go you just
Get off the bus and go home...
(Yeah yeah)

God tell me a truth how much is too many (Yeah yeah)
Give me a sign if we've crossed the line (Yeah yeah)
Cause everyone else seems to know the direction
And I'm frozen, from not knowing and
I'm out of breath from
The speed of life
And I'm shakin' and it's racing 'cause I'm
Scared to death
Of the speed of life
The speed of life

How many dreams can you
Break till you're broken
How many fights can you fight till you fall
Down on your knees
How many doors can get slammed in your face
Till one of them opens
It's beautiful it's incredible it's the danger of life
(Yeah yeah)

God tell me a truth how much is too many (Yeah yeah)
Give me a sign if we've crossed the line (Yeah yeah)
Cause everyone else seems to know the direction
And I'm frozen, from not knowing and
I'm out of breath from
The speed of life
And I'm shakin' and it's racing 'cause I'm
Scared to death
Of the speed of life
The speed of life
And I'm shakin' and it's racing 'cause I'm
Scared to death
Of the speed of life

Speed of life

Yeah yeah
The speed of life
