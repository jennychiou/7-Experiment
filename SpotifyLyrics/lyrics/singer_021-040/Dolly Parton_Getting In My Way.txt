I wish I could forget you, but I won't
I wish I loved another, but I don't
It's just the same, day after day
Your memory keeps getting in my way

But I'm hoping I will be alright
But I don't eat, don't sleep at night
I close my eyes I see your face
Your memory keeps getting in my way

I don't know why I can't forget you
I don't see why I should let you
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday
Your memory keeps getting in my way

It's easy for someone to lie
Like saying I'll forget you and I'll try
Here's hoping that I will someday
Your memory keeps getting in my way

I don't know why I can't forget you
I don't see why I should let you
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday
Your memory keeps getting in my way
