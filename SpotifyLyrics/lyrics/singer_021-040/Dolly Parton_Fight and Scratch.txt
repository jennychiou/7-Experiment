Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you

Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
I figured you'd mention that smart aleck
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...

Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
'Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave Bossy Catfish
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...

Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know that we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...

Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow
