Darling, I know your heart's seen better times
I know our songs had better rhymes
Before today
Darling, I guess I made the wrong mistakes
I understand if you need your space
Please take your time

Before you go away you need to realize

Baby, it's not just you
You know it hurts me too
Watching you leave
With tears on your sleeve
Notice that mine aren't exactly dry
Baby, it's not just you
That's hurting
It's me too

I'm sory
I wasn't there to catch the fall
I didn't hear you when you've called

All of those nights
Please don't forget the good days with me
I can make back the heart aching beat
When it gets dark and it's hard to see
I'll turn on the lights

Before you go away you need to realize

Baby, it's not just you
You know it hurts me too
Watching you leave
With tears on your sleeve
Notice that mine aren't exactly dry
Baby, it's not just you
That's hurting
It's me too

It's me too
