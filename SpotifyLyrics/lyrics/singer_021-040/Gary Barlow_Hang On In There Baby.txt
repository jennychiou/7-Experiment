Yeah, gonna make love tonight
Hang on in there baby
Mm mm oh
We can't help but make it
We're gonna make love tonight
Whoaaaoh
Woo!

Now that we've caressed
A kiss so warm and tender
I can't wait till we've reached
That sweet moment of surrender
Oh we'll hear the thunder roar
Feel the lightening strike
At a point we both decided to meet
At the same time tonight

Hang on in there baby
Hang on in there darling
I'm gonna give you more
Than you ever dreamed possible
Don't be afraid baby, no way
Sweet virgin of the world, yeah

We can't help but make it (we can't help but make it)
Because there's true love between us girl
Oh so let us touch that cloud
Everyone dreams of
Oh we're almost there darling
We're truly making love

Hang on in there baby
Please don't let me down
Please don't destroy
This new joy we've found

Oh oh

What's that now baby
What's that you say
Something's eating at you
And it's about to get away
Don't fight it baby you'd better open up the door
'Cause that's the key to freedom that we've both been working for
Let it go baby, let it go honey
Oh right there, right there
Baby don't you move it anywhere

Go baby, let it go baby
Let it go honey, oh honey
Oh right there, right there
Baby don't you move it
Don't you dare

Hang on in there baby
Hang on in there darling
I'm gonna give you more
Than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there baby
Please don't let me down
Please don't distroy
This new joy we've found

Hang on in there baby
Hang on in there darling (hang on in there darling)
I'm gonna give you more (gonna give you more)
Than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there baby (yeah)
Please don't let me down
Please don't distroy
This new joy we've found

Hang on in there baby
Hang on in there darling (hang on in there baby)
I'm gonna give you more (hang on in there baby)
Than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there baby (yeah)
Please don't let me down
Please don't distroy
This new joy we've found
