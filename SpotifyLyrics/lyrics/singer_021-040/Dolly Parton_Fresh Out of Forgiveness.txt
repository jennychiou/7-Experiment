Don't tell me you're sorry for thing you caused me
And from from now on you'll be true
And don't don't you ask me to forgive you again I'm fresh out of forgiveness for you

Now I, I gave you everything I knew how to give
Now I've done done everything you've ever asked me to do
But even even a fool gets so tired being fool I'm fresh out of forgiveness for you

No I I can't I just can't I can't forgive you this time if I did oh I know you do
Well you're just too just too wrong and you hurt me hurt me again
And I'm fresh out of forgiveness for you I'm fresh out of forgiveness for you
