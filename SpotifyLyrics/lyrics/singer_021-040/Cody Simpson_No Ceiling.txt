I like this right here
Yeah

Bang bang bang
Is the sound of my tools
You've got me taking down my roof
'Cause there ain't no limit on the heights we can go
When it comes to me and you

See you hit me where it hurts now
Got me where it hurts now
Never felt like this before
See it's a brand new thing
So no more thinking
Never ever felt so sure

When I'm away
No I can't concentrate
Thinking 'bout you non-stop
On my mind all day
Said to myself that I feel so lucky
I met someone who made me say

I see there ain't no ceiling
On the way that you got me feeling
And every night we're in the moonlight dreaming
That we can go all the way
This love could reach the sky
(x2)

Bang bang bang
Is the sound of my heart
Every time I look at you
And it's bang bang bang
The sound of your heart
When you're looking at me too?

And when the love truth hits
No you feel no pain
Nothing's gonna be the same
See it's a brand new thing
So no more thinking
Cupid's gonna take an aim

When I'm away
No I can't concentrate
Thinking 'bout you non-stop
On my mind all day
Said to myself that I feel so lucky
I met someone who made me say:

I see there ain't no ceiling
On the way that you got me feeling
And every night we're in the moonlight dreaming
That we can go all the way
This love could reach the sky
(x2)

Don't ever keep it baby
Don't ever keep it inside
Tell me what I'm doing wrong
If it's wrong, tell me how do I make it right

Rip the lid off life
Let's rip the lid off love

I see there ain't no ceiling
On the way that you got me feeling
And every night we're in the moonlight dreaming
That we can go all the way
This love could reach the sky
(x3)
