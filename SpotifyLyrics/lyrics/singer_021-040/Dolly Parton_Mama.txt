Mama, the one that wipes the noses and the tears
Mama, the one who keeps the peace and calms the fears
She irons and washes clothes
She cooks, she cleans, she sews
She's good about resolving family drama
A friend, our guiding light
She's daddy's loving wife
A constant in our lives
Mama

The one that never sleeps 'til all's in bed
The one that never eats 'til all are fed
Her never-ending love,
Her gentle, caring touch
She never asked for much
Mama

Oh mama, the one that wipes the noses and the tears
Oh mama, the one who keeps the peace and calms the fears
She irons and washes clothes
She cooks, she cleans, she sews
An angel heaven knows
Mama

Mama you will always be 
The very core and heart of me
And even though you're gone
I see your love in everything

When I look in my children's eyes
It makes me think and realize
What you've done to enrich my life
I hope I can do the same

Oh mama, the one who wipes the noses and the tears
Oh mama, the one who keeps the peace and calms the fears
She irons and washes clothes
She cooks, she cleans, she sews
An angel heaven knows
Mama
A friend, our guiding light
She's daddy's loving wife
A constant in our lives
Mama

An angel in our lives
Sweet mama
Oh mama
Mmm-hmm
I love you, mama
