Oh I been hurting lately
I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this baby
But I know that I can't give up
Tough times I just take them in stride

I'm almost there, only one more step
Left, right, left, right, left
I'm moving on, I got no regrets
Left, right, left, right, left

I said times are changing, tell me how can I keep up
Every time that I turn around there's a wall
But I'm climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you're brokenhearted
And you're lost without me
Yeah you gotta walk alone, yeah it's true
Flash every smile 'cause I've been lost for miles
I know you've felt this way before too

We're almost there baby one more step
Left, right, left, right, left
We're moving on, we got no regrets
Left, right, left, right, left
Left, right, left, right, left
Left, right, left, right, left
We're almost there only one more step
Left, right, left, right, left

I know it looks like it's too far
But it's nothing compared to how far we've come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

We're almost there baby one more step
Left, right, left, right, left
We're moving forward and there's no regrets
Left, right, left, right, left
Left, right, left, right, left
Left, right, left, right, left
We're almost there only one more step
Left, right, left, right, left
Left, right, left, right, left
Left, right, left, right, left
Left, right, left, right, left
We're almost there only one more step
Left, right, left, right, left
