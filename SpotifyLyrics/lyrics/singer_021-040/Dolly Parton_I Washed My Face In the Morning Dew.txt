The first strange town I was ever in the county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died and I just didn't understand

So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along

The second strange town I was in they were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand

So I washed my face in the morning dew...

The third strange town that I was in was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didn't seem right

So I washed my face in the morning dew...

Now someday times are bound to change it can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen will come before the bar

Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew and my journey will be done
