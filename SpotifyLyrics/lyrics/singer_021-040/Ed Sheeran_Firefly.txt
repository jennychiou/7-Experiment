I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet 
Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly 
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

Teach my skin 
Those new tricks
Warm me up 
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It's too cold
In this town
Close your eyes
Lean on me
Face to mouth
Lips to cheek
Feeling numb
In my feet
You're the one
To help me
Get to sleep

And hold me tight

Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly 
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

It's only been 
One night of love
And maybe 
That is not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

It's only been 
One night of love
And maybe 
That's not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
