Just a few old memories 
Slipped in through my door 
Though I thought I had closed it 
So tightly before 
I can't understand it 
Why it should bother my mind 
For it all belongs to another place and time 
Just a few old keep-sakes 
Way back on the shelf 
No, they don't mean nothin' 
Well I'm surprised they're still left 
Just a few old love letters 
With the edges all brown 
And an old faded picture 
I keep turned upside-down 

Just a few old memories 
Going way back in time 
Well I can hardly remember 
I don't know why I'm cryin' 
I can't understand it 
Well I'm surprised myself 
First thing tomorrow morning 
I'll clean off that shelf 

Just a few old keep-sakes 
Way back on the shelf 
No, they don't mean nothin' 
Well I'm surprised that they're left 
Just a few old love letters 
With their edges all brown 
And an old faded picture 
I keep turned upside-down
