You have a date for half past 8 tonight 
Some distant bells starts chiming 9 
You wanna see her 
You wanna see her, oh yeah 
So you wait, you wait and wait 
Girl don't come 

The time rolls on, those minutes fly by 
You wanna go, but just you try, guy 
You wanna see her 
You wanna see her, oh yeah 
So you wait, you wait and wait 
Girl don't come 

You've been stood up 
Tears fill your eyes, oh, oh 
You're hurt inside 
You wanna die, oh, oh
