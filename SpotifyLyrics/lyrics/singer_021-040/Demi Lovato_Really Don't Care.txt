"'Demi Lovato"'
You want to play
You want to stay
You want to have it all
You started messin' with my head until I hit a wall

Maybe I should have known
Maybe I should have known
That you would walk, you would walk, out the door
Hey!

Said we were done then met someone 
And rubbed it in my face
Cut to the part, she broke your heart, and then she ran away

I guess you should have known
I guess you should have known 
That I would talk, I would talk

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you

Oh no, not anymore
Oh no, not anymore
You had your shot, had your shot
But you let go

Now if we meet out on the street, I won't be runnin' scared
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air

And make you understand
And make you understand
You had your chance, had your chance

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

"'Cher Lloyd"'
Yeah, listen up!
Hey, hey, never look back
Dumbstruck boy, ego intact
Look boy, why you so mad?
Second guessin', but should've hit that

Hey Demi, you picked the wrong lova
You shoulda picked that one, he's cuter than the other
I just wanna laugh 'cause you're tryna be a hipster
Kick him to the curb, take a Polaroid picture

"'Demi Lovato"'
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care

Oh! Oh! Oh! I really don't care
