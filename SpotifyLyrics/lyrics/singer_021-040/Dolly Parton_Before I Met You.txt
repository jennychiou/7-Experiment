I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time 
But that was before I met you 
I never saw one that I wanted for mine 
But that was before I met you 
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail 
I thought I could never be blue 
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved 
But that was before I met you 

I thought I'd stay single always be free 
But that was before I met you 
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me 
But that was before I met you 

I thought I was swinging the world by the tail 
I thought I could never be blue 
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved 
But that was before I met you 

That was before I met you
