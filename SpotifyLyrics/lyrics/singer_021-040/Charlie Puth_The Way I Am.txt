Yeah

Maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide (oh)
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

And that's okay
I promise myself one day
Hey!

I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am

Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore (oh)
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this (-serve this)
Life ain't nothing like it was before (ain't nothing like before)
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface (surface)
Baby, I'm a little insecure

And that's okay (baby, now, that's okay)
I promised myself one day
Hey!

I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am

I'ma tell 'em all (that's just the way I am)
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
(That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am

Am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along
Everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide

That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am
('Cause everybody's trying to be famous)

I'ma tell 'em all
