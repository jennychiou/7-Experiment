Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, still I'll never own you
Making believe, it's all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe

Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours are fun and so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe what else can I do

Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
