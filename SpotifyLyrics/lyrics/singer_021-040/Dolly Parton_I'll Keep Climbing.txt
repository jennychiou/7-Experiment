As I travel life's pathway to that city beyond
I find the way so narrow and my strength almost gone
Then I cry oh Lord have mercy please don't leave me all alone
Cause somehow I've got to make it make heaven my home
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make it my home
And I'll soon be with Jesus round the great white throne
Though the way may seem rugged Lord I must travel on
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make heaven my home

My friends they forsake me my companions are few
I'll keep my eyes toward heaven no matter what others do
I'll keep my mind upon Jesus for his way I will choose
Soon I'll reach heaven's portal seems it's almost in view
I'll keep climbing...
I'll keep climbing...
Make heaven my home
