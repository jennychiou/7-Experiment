From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive

I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting

My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me

I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting
