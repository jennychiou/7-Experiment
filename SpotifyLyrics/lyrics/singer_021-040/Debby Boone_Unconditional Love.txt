I feel your pain, I share your loneliness 
Your tears are my tears, too 
We're all the same in the eyes of love 
So when you're all out of solutions 
And when you feel you've had enough 
And you're surrounded with confusion 
Don't give up 

Somebody cares, somebody hears you 
Somebody knows your name 
Somebody sees your heart as an empty cup 
Let me fill it up, with 
Unconditional love 

I see the storm, the clouds are thundering 
Your hopes are washing away 
But after rain something's bound to grow 
So when you think there is no shelter 
And your time is running out 
He's your brother, I'm your sister 
And we can say without a doubt 

Somebody cares, somebody needs you 
Somebody knows your name 
Somebody feels your heart getting ready to break 
Let me heal it up, with 
Unconditional love 

So when you think there is no shelter 
And your time is running out 
He's your brother, I'm your sister 
And we can say without a doubt 

Somebody cares, somebody needs you 
Somebody knows your name 
Somebody feels your heart getting ready to break 
Let me heal it up, with 
Unconditional love 

Let me heal it up 
There's still time enough 
Let me fill it up with 
Unconditional love 
Unconditional love
