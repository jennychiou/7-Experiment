Tonight my heart is sad and weary 
Wonderin' if I'm wrong or right 
I dream about you though you've left me 
I wonder where you are tonight 

The rain is cold and slowly fallin' 
Upon my window pane tonight 
And though you're love was even colder 
I wonder where you are tonight 

It's spring, the birds are gaily singing 
The trees are blossoming so sweet 
No other love was quite so happy 
No other love was so complete 

The rain is cold and slowly fallin' 
Upon my window pane tonight 
And though you're love was even colder 
I wonder where you are tonight 

Then came the dawn the day you left me 
I tried to smile with all my might 
But you could see the pain within me 
It still lingers in my heart tonight 

Oh, the rain is cold and slowly fallin' 
Upon my window pane tonight 
And though you're love is even colder 
I wonder where you are tonight
