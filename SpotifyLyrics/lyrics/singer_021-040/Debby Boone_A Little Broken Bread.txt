You worked Your miracles 
On hills beneath the desert sun 
Like the place that I come from 
And if I close my eyes, I can see You work one more 

There were 5,000 fed 
From a single meal there in Your hand 
Now You fill my hunger just like then 
But the feast is so much better than before 

In Your hands 
A little broken bread can satisfy 
This heart of mine 
By Your might 
My empty cup now overflows 
With holy wine 

I meet You here to face to face 
And I long to touch what I can't see 
And taste more of Your mystery 
Till my thirst is gone 
And my discontent is stilled 

In Your hands 
A little broken bread can satisfy 
This heart of mine 
By Your might 
My empty cup now overflows 
With holy wine 

You are the bread from Heaven 
Your flesh and blood are life to me 
Life that meets the deepest need 
And no seek soul 
Could ever walk away unfilled 

In Your hands 
A little broken bread can satisfy 
This heart of mine 
By Your might 
My empty cup now overflows 
With holy wine
