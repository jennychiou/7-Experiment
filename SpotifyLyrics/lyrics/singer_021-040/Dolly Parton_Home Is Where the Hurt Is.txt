We're well known in every honky tonk in town
Not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds
People wonder why we choose to live this way
Why don't they ever stay at home I hear them say

But home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore

What was once our happy home has come to be
A place to fuss and fight and disagree
Our lonely house with wall to wall regret
And these bright lights somehow help us to forget

Cause home is where the hurt is...
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore
