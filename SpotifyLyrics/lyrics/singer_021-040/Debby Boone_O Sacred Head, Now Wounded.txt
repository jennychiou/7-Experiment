O sacred Head, now wounded, 
With grief and shame weighed down, 
Now scornfully surrounded 
With thorns, Thy only crown 

How art thou pale with anguish, 
With sore abuse and scorn 
How doth Thy visage languish 
That once was bright as morn 

What language shall I borrow 
To thank Thee, dearest Friend, 
For this, Thy dying sorrow, 
Thy pity without end? 
Oh, make me thine forever 
And should I fainting be, 
Lord, let me never, never, 
Outlive my love for Thee
