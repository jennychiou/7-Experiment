I found your letter in my mailbox today
You were just checkin' if I was okay
And if I still miss you
Well you know what they say

Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon

No need to tell me you'd like to be friends
And help me get back on my feet again
And do I still miss you?
Well it's just now and then

Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon

There's a blue moon shinin'
When I'm reminded
Of all we've been through
Such a blue moon shinin'
Does it ever shine down on you?

Oh, 'cause you act like
It never even hurt you at all
And I'm the only one
Gettin' up from a fall
Tell me you don't feel it
Oh can't you recall

Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
