I've been sittin' here a' looking
At the clock big daddy
Already you're a half-hour late
I've been a' pulling back the curtains
Peeping out the window
Wish you wouldn't make me wait
You better move it on home, boy
You better move it on home

Been a' sittin' here listening
To the jukebox playing
And forgettin' where I ought to be
Sipping on a cool one
Having me some good fun
Time got away from me
I better move it on home
Better move it on home

Better spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home

I've been here a' cooking you a nice hot supper
And you can't even eat it on time
Heatin' up the meat loaf and stirring up the gravy
It's kinda got to messing up my mind
You better move it on home, boy
You better move it on home

Been a' speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
I remember what I forgot
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
Hoping I won't get stopped
Better move it on home
Better move it on home

Better spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home

Better spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home

"spoken:"
Better move it on home, daddy
You're running just a little shade late
I'm on my way baby, this traffic is murder
Ah, that's what I thought
That's what it's gonna be at home
If you don't get here soon
Traffic's a' messing up my mind
You're messing up mine
