Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far that I'll lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back

Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine

Me, I'll be just fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But, still I won't let sorrow bring me way down.

Me, I'll be just fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But, still I won't let sorrow bring me way down.

Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on

Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone and make him mine

Me, I'll be just fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But, still I won't let sorrow bring me way down.

Me, I'll be just fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But, still I won't let sorrow bring me way down.
