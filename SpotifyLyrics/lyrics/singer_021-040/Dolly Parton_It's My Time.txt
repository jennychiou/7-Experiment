It's my time
Gather round girls
You I grew up with
My old friends that I used to scuff with
Need you round me
At this time
You've all had your turn to cry
An old friend stood closely by
Friends of mine
Stand by me
'Cause it's my time
It's my time
It's my time
It's my time to cry
It's my time to cry
Oh oh oh oh
It's my turn to cry yeah
It's my time
Gather round boys
I used to play house with
Come here boys
I first kissed on the mouth with
Need your tender words so kind
You've all had your misty eyes
An old friend stood by to dry
Friends of mine
Stand by me
'Cause it's my time

It's my time
It's my time
It's my time to cry
Whoa whoa
It's my time to cry yeah
It's my turn to cry mmm

Fade:

It's my time
It's my time
It's my time to cry mmmm
