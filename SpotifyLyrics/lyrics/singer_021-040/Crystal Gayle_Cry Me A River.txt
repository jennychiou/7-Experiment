Now you say you're lonely, you cry the whole night through;
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river,
I cried a river over you.

Now you say you're sorry for being so untrue;
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river,
I cried a river over you.

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head;
While you never shed a tear;
Remember? I remember all that you said -
Told me love was too plebian,
Told me you were through with me, and,

Now you say you love me; well, just to prove it's true,
You can cry me a river, cry me a river,
I cried a river over you.

Cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you.
