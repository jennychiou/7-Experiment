The space in between us starts to feel like we're world's apart
Like I'm going crazy 
And you say it's raining in your heart
You're telling me nobody's there, to dry out the flood
Oh but that's just crazy
'Cause baby I told ya I'm here for good

My love's like a star yeah, you can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there
When you see one shinin', take it as mine
And remember I'm always near
If you see a comet, baby I'm on it
Makin' my way back home
Just follow the glow, yeah it won't be long
Just know that you're not alone

I tried to build the walls to keep you safe when I'm not around
But as soon as I'm away from you, you say they come tumbling down
But it's not about the time that we don't get to spend together
It's about how strong our love is
When I'm gone and it feels like forever

My love's like a star yeah, you can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there
When you see one shinin', take it as mine
And remember I'm always near
(If you see a comet)
If you see a comet, baby I'm on it
Making my way back home
Just follow the glow, yeah it won't be long
Just know that you're not alone

You say that time away makes your heart grow numb
But I can stay just to prove you wrong
Oh look at how far we've come
Don't you know
Don't know that you're the one?

Ooh
(You're not alone)

My love's like a star yeah, you can't always see me
But you know that I'm always there (Know that I'm always there)
When you see one shinin', take it as mine
And remember I'm always near (Oh yeah yeah yeah)
If you see a comet, baby I'm on it
Makin' my way back home (Makin' my way back to you)
Just follow the glow, yeah it won't be long
Just know that you're not alone
