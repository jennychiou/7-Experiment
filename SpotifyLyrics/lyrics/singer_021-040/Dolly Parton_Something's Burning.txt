You lie in gentle sleep beside me 
I hear your warm and rhythmic breathing 
I take your hand and hold it tightly 
Listen, can you not hear our young heart's beating 

I kiss the sleep from your eyes 
Your smile is sweeter than the morning 
And here it comes, can't you feel it, baby 
Can't you feel it, here it comes 
Feel it, feel it, fire, fire 
Something's burning, something's burning 
Something's burning, and I think it's love 

And now the sun is burning brightly 
We lie in love so close together 
And I get the feeling deep inside me 
My love for you will burn forever 

I cup my hands to touch your face 
Once again I feel your fire 
And here it comes, can't you feel it, baby 
Can't you feel it, here it comes 
Feel it, feel it, fire, fire 
Something's burning, something's burning 
Something's burning, and I think it's love 

I think it's love, I think it's love 
I think it's love, I think it's love 
Can't you feel, the fire keeps burning 
Can't you feel, the fire keeps burning 
Can't you feel, the fire keeps burning love
