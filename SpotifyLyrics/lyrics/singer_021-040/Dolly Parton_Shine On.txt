The greatest gift, the gift of life 
The gift of love divine 
God gave us all a special gift 
He meant for it to shine 
He meant for it to shine 
The darkest night can be made light 
By one bright word or smile 
If we'd put on our neighbor's shoes 
And choose to walk a mile 
God gave us all our own free will 
To choose the paths we take 
No greater deed could e'er be done 
Than for another's sake 
The greatest gift, the gift of life 
The gift of love divine 
God gave us all a special gift 
He meant for it to shine 
He meant for it to shine 

Shine on, shine on, for all to see 
God's light inside your soul 
Shine on, shine on, let love flow free 
Warm others in its glow 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
So hide it not or it will fade 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 

The greatest gift, the gift of life 
The gift of love divine 
God gave us all a special gift 
He meant for it to shine 
Shine on, shine on, shine on
