Hey everybody
Don't you think it's time we got together?
Don't you think it's time we stop wondering
Whether we're right or we're wrong?
Together we're strong
We can take it or fake it
But we can make it

Hey everybody
Don't you think that life could be so much better?
If we finally put an end to
Let's find her and get her
And love her and forget her
And then let's pretend that you never had met her

'Cause you and me
Hey, we could be
More than wild creatures or fish in the sea
You and me before this day ends
It might turn out we could even be friends

So hey everybody
Go meet your brother just half the way
Say one kind word and make his day brighter
And if he is weary, well, offer your hand
You could make his load lighter
You could make his load lighter

'Cause you and me
Hey, we could be
More than wild creatures or fish in the sea
You and me before this day ends
It might turn out we could even be friends

So hey everybody
Don't you think it's time we got together?
Don't you think it's time we stop wondering
Whether we're right or we're wrong?
Together we're strong
We can take it or fake it
But we can make it

You and me
Hey, we could be
More than wild creatures or fish in the sea
You and me before this day ends
It might turn out we could even be friends
We could be friends
We could be friends
You and me, we could be friends
