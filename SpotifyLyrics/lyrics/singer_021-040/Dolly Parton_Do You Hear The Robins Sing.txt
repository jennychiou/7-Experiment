Where you live you say the view is so beautiful
And the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year around
And the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven
But do you ever ever hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins singing in the springtime
While a mockingbird sings his happy song
Is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing

Where I live the butterflies still kiss the roses
And forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane
And the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze
And often I still hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins...
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
