On a park bench on sunny afternoon
Sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
As we stood so closely by watched them hold each other's hand
On their faces love had written we're making plans

Then he said to her you're my guiding light
Then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
Then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
Then I thought how close they must be

Souch tenderness my eyes have never seen
Two young lovers both just in their teens
Though their world gives them no light they see much more than you and me
Don't you know how close they must be

Then a car stopped just a few steps away
And a voice said Jim and Jeannie it's time to go
With their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
Can you imagine just how close they are
Don't you know how close they must be
