Beggars can't be choosey, I know
That's what the people say
But though my heart is begging for love
I've turned some love away

Maybe one was true love
I'll never know which 'cause
Your love is the only love to make this beggar rich

I'm a choosey beggar, choosey beggar and you're my choice

People say you can't have your cake
And then eat it, too
They tell me that I'm making a mistake
Waiting around for you
Oh, I'm begging for love but why can't they see
That yours is the only love for me

I'm a choosey beggar, choosey beggar and you're my choice
Say it one more time now (you're my choice)

If beg you I must then I'll never give up
'Cause your love is the only love to fill this beggar's cup
I'm choosey, and you're my choice

Well I need someone to hold me (you're my choice)
And I need arms to enfold me (you're my choice)
When I need someone beside me (you're my choice)
If I had you, how happy I'd be (you're my choice)
