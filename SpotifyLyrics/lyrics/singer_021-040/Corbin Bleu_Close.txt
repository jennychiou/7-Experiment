Who was I to think that I would ever be okay?
When the one that I need is like a hundred thousand miles away
I was trippin' to think that I could make
It one day without you, world's built around you

Girl you're the air that I breathe
And baby you're the, you're the one thing I see
You ought to know that I need you with me, no
Can't take this no more, no so I got to go

I'd do anythin' to have you close
Even if I gotta swim the ocean alone
It just ain't enough when you're on the phone
Comin' to get you, I gotta have you close

I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close
I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close

When I'm with my friends only you stay on my mind
Girl since you been gone my heart's been beatin' out of time
I knew the moment that I looked in your eyes
There's somethin' special took it to another level

So I don't need it if ain't you
And I don't want it if I can't have you
Every minute you're away all through the night and the day
I'm thinkin' of you 'cause

You're the air that I breathe
And baby you're the, you're the one thing I see
You ought to know that I need you with me, no
Can't take this no more, no so I got to go

I'd do anythin' to have you close
Even if I gotta swim the ocean alone
It just ain't enough when you're on the phone
Comin' to get you, I gotta have you close

I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close
I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close

I can't stand another second here without you
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do
To get close to you, girl I need you close

I'd do anythin' to have you close
Even if I gotta swim the ocean alone
It just ain't enough when you're on the phone
Comin' to get you, I gotta have you close

I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close
I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close

I'd do anythin' to have you close
Even if I gotta swim the ocean alone
It just ain't enough when you're on the phone
Comin' to get you, I gotta have you close

I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close
I gotta have you close, I really need you close
Baby I want you, just gotta have you close

You're the air that I breathe
And baby you're the, you're the one thing I see
