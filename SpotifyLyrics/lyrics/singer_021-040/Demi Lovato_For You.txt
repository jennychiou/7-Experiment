Reasons why you run
Don't make you a good man
Yes, I understand
You were on time at the wrong time
I was debating, but tried and I don't know why
You can act cold on a dime and so outta line

For you
I'd do anything for you
Nail my heart to the ceiling
Put my fist through a wall
How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down
(Break down, break down)
I take the blows like a champion 
(Champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all

Reasons for my hope
All make me a big joke
I already know
You were just fine, I was just fine why
Did we turn a good time to a dark one
I give you a chance, but the better man never comes

For you (for you)
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)
Put my fist through a wall
How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down 
(Break down, break down)
I take the blows like a champion 
(Champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all

For you
I'd do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you (Put my fist through a wall)
I would do anything 

For you (for you)
I'd do anything for you
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)
Put my fist through a wall
(Put my fist through a wall)
How come (how come)
I stick around when I break down 
(I stick around when I break down)
I take the blows like a champion 
(Champion, champion)
But I get nothing at all 
(But I get nothing, but I get nothing at all, I get nothing at all)

For you
I'd do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
