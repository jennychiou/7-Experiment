I'm always thinkin' about you
I wonder if you can tell
These things I'm feelin' inside me
I keep them all to myself
Scared to show my true emotions
Don't wanna love alone

Because I fall, so deep
You'll never know
How far I go
And I know why
Hearts beat, desperately
I fall so deep
Yeah I fall so deep,

Some people think love is foolish
While others think it's a game
I think that love is a fire
I'm burnin' up in your flame
I'm so lost in my emotions
Wanting you ever more, ooh ooh

Because I fall, so deep
You'll never know
How far I go
And I know why
Hearts beat, desperately
I fall so deep

I fall so deep
I fall so deep
I fall so deep

And I've come so close to the part
Where I reveal my heart to you
But I lose my nerve, can't find the words
To tell that it's true
I fall so deep

I fall, so deep
You'll never know
How far I go
And I know why
Hearts beat, oh so desperately
I fall so deep

I fall, so deep
You'll never know (never know)
How far I go (you'll never know)
And I know why
Hearts beat, desperately
I fall so deep

I'm always thinkin' about you (I fall so deep)
I wonder if you can tell (and I fall so deep)
These things I'm feelin' inside me (I fall so deep)
'Cause I fall so deep
