I'm sorry I was weak enough to step out on you
Well I should have been strong enough not to step out on you too
I know that I'd hurt you and I stepped out for spite
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right

I'm not making excuses for myself I was wrong as I could be
But you shouldn't have cheapened yourself trying to get even with me
My conscience bothers me mine won't let me sleep at night
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right

Two wrongs don't make one right and now we both got heartaches
But if we both try we can forgive each other for our mistakes
We let no wonderful love slip through our hands we'd better hold on tight
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
