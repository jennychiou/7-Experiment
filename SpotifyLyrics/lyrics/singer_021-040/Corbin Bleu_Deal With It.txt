We've been together for too long
And we've been through too much
To have the same conversations
You seem to like so much

So you gotta think I'm cheatin'
You don't listen well
I don't wanna talk girl (no)
Why don't you just tell me what I,
What I gotta do, girl, to get through to you
So, I can ease your mind
It's all about you girl
If you don't know then you have got to

Deal with it (oh) I ain't tellin' you no lies
Girl, Deal with it (oh)
Tell me why you roll your eyes
Just, Deal wit it (oh)
'Cause you know, Ain't nobody but you (oh)
You should know, Ain't nobody but you

I don't really know what's with you
And who's been feedin you lies (iies)
What is with the constant questions (hmm)
Girl you really haven't been actin' right

I don't thrive on attention and
I won't lead me to stray
How can I make you see
The fact of the bottom is
All that I wanna know is what I,

What I gotta do, girl
To get through to you so
I can ease your mind
It's all about you girl
If you don't know then you have got to

Deal with it (oh) I ain't tellin' you no lies
Girl, Deal with it (oh)
Tell me why you roll your eyes, just
Deal with it (oh)
'Cause you know, ain't nobody but you (oh)
You should know, ain't nobody but you

Hold on, told you more than once
And you really gotta understand girl
That every time that you wanna front
And you stop to wonder where I am
I wish you would just stop acting this way
I wish you just realize that you push me away (Actin' the fool)
Nobody, nobody, nobody, but
Nobody, nobody but you girl [repeat]

Deal with it (oh) I ain't tellin' you no lies
Girl, deal with it (oh)
Tell me why you roll your eyes, just
Deal with it (oh)
'Cause you know, ain't nobody but you (oh)
You should know, ain't nobody but you [repeat]
