Put down your cigar
And pick me up
Play me your guitar
That song I love
Thirsty for your love
Fill up my cup
I got only good intentions
So give me your attention

You're only brave in the moonlight
So why don't you stay till sunrise

Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship
Let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time
Let's ruin the friendship
Let's ruin the friendship

Baby you and I got history
And we can't deny our chemistry
So why the fuck are we a mystery
Let's just go with the connection
Give me your affection

You're only brave in the moonlight
So why don't you stay till sunrise

Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship
Let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time
Let's ruin the friendship
Let's ruin the friendship

No I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No I can't keep denying every minute I think of you

Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship
Let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time
Let's ruin the friendship
Let's ruin the friendship
