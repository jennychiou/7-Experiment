I grew up dirty and I grew up poor 
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door 
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare 
And I had the gift of imagination 
I could change my situation 
Anytime I choose I could always go 
Down Paradise Road 
I found a kingdom deep within 
A place dream and to pretend 
And to prepare for the world out there 
A dream can dress you when you're ragged 
Fill you up when hunger's naggin' 
I warmed my soul when life was cold 
On Paradise Road 

Paradise is a state of mind 
The sun shines warm and all the time 
And the rain don't flow and the wind don't blow 
On Paradise Road 
A place no one can take from me 
A place of everlasting peace 
Where dreamers go; It's never closed 
Paradise Road 

Paradise is a state of mind 
Down the road of life and time 
And the friends we meet 
Make the travlin' sweet 
On Paradise Road 
Sometimes now when the world is mad 
I find that place I've always had 
Inside my soul; It's paved in gold 
Paradise Road 

I grew up dirty and I grew up poor 
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door 
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare 
But I had the gift of imagination 
I could change my situation 
Anytime I choose I could always go 
Down Paradise Road
