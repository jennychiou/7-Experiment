Raindrops tumble to the ground 
Making puddles all around 
Drops of rain that look like tears 
Fall on my window pane 

Raindrops seem to harmonize 
With teardrops falling from my eyes 
And my tears keep falling down 
As steady as the rain 

Steady as the rain they fall 
Tears that just won't dry at all 
Tears that cannot wash away the pain 
Sometimes without knowing it 
I touch my face and find it wet 
And my tears keep falling down 
As steady as the rain 

I can't face the fact that 
I am not important in your life 
Once you lived for rollin' me 

And then your feelings changed 
There's just no gettin' over you 
I try so hard, but it's no use 
And my tears keep falling down 
As steady as the rain 

Raindrops just keep falling down 
Beatin' out their rhythmic sounds 
Dancin' as they play their sweet refrain 
Memories of you cloud my mind 
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin' 
And my tears keep falling down 
As steady as the rain 
As steady as the rain 

Steady as the rain they fall 
Tears that just won't dry at all 
Tears that just won't wash away the pain 
Memories of you cloud my mind 
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin' 
And my tears keep falling down 
As steady as the rain 
As steady as the rain
