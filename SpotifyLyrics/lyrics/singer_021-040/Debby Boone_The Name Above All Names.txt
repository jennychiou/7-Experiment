It's the name above all names 
And we will declare it, we will declare it 
It's the name above all names 
And we will shout it to a dying world 

Who will declare my name 
Who will shout my name in the midst of the nations 
Who will take the shield of faith and the sword of my word 
And declare my name to a dying world? 

He who had declared me thus far 
Will walk in even greater power 
For the sands of time are running out 
By my name will be declared 
In this final hour 

I am Jehovah, I am that I am 
And my trumpet shall soon call out 
I formed the worlds with a whisper 
But I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready 
I'm getting ready to shout 

It's the name above all names 
And we will declare it, we will declare it 
It's the name above all names 
And we will shout it to a dying world 

It's my will to possess all of your life 
I'll take it all, so surrender to me 
For I'm building an army 
To go in my name 
And my words in your mouth 
Shall set the captives free 

I am Jehovah, I am that I am 
And my trumpet shall soon call out 
I formed the worlds with a whisper 
But I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready 
I'm getting ready to shout 

It's the name above all names 
And we will shout it to a dying world 
It's the name above all names 
And we will declare it, we will declare it 
It's the name above all names 
And we will shout it to a dying world
