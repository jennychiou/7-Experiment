It's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from letting it show 
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from telling you so 
I wasn't looking for love when I found you 
Just someone to be with and have a good time 
But I get these strange funny feelings around you 
When you're not with me, you're still on my mind 

And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from letting it show 
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from telling you so 

I had intended to wait for a long time 
I thought that love would just mess up my plans 
'Cause I had big plans for a bright shining future 
Could this be my future that's holding my hand 

And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from letting it show 
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from telling you so 

I need to tell you how I feel about you 
But I'm so afraid that you don't feel the same 
But if I don't tell you how I feel about you 
I just might lose you, can I take that chance 

And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from letting it show 
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you 
All I can do to keep from telling you so
