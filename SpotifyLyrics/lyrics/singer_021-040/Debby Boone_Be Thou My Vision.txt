Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart; 
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art 
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night, 
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light 

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word; 
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord; 
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son; 
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one 

Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, 
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all
