Sure is good to be with you 
There is nothing I would rather do 
Than spend my life with you 
Always found me looking for 
Someone smiling by an open door 
I can't believe it's true 

You taught me how to give 
I never knew 
You showed me how to live 
By loving you 
I love you so much 
I'd even let you go 

Even in the darkest night 
I can close my eyes and see your light 
That is why I know 
I love you so much 
I'd even let you go 

I love you so much 
I'd even let you go
