Just like the glorious northern star you guided me
Shining a light of pure tranquility
To a secret place where no-one else could go
Free to reveal the things I never show

Strong like a symphony
You protected me
From reality

Somewhere to love somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Here in the dark I can be strong
Knowing that nothing can hurt from now on
Somewhere to love somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Closer to the sun
To your heart I run

I was deserted like the moon is at the dawn
I never thought I'd ever find a place so beautiful
All my heart was falling like a stone
Deep into an ocean vast and colourful

Strong like a symphony
You protected me
From reality

Somewhere to love somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Here in the dark I can be strong
Knowing that nothing can hurt from now on
Somewhere to love somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Closer to the sun
To your heart I run

One step on the horizon
A safe place up on the mountain
So far away from chaotic life
