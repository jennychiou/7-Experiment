He walks in my mind like a shadow
Someone speaks his name and he appears
I can see his face in total darkness
Oh, he's everywhere

He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
And I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere

He waits in the corners of my mind
And in the stillness of the night, he walks around
Sometimes his memory's so real I think he's really there
Oh, he's everywhere

He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
Oh, he's everywhere
