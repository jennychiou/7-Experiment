She was born in a place called Blue Valley 
At the foot of the Tennessee hills 
With the blue birds and blue bells 
And blue mountain water 
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill 
But there was no peace in the valley 
Her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man 
Used and abused her mind and her body 
So her mama said run while you can 
So at fifteen she took to the highway 
Belongings and guitar in hand 
And she buried herself in her music 
The one thing she did understand 
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet 
Her voice has that high, lonesome sound 
She hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it 
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around 
She hopes someday she will make it 
And everyone says that she will 
When she comes to town, crowds flock around 
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills 
She writes her letter back home to her mama 
In care of the preacher in town 
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church 
And so her daddy cannot track her down 

And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby 
Whenever she turns off the lights 
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy 
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry 

Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue Cadillac 
A band dressed in blue by her side 
Instruments tied to the top and the back 
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight 

One nighters, honky tonks, years flying by 
She never made it, but Lord knows she tries 
Expressing the feelings she holds inside 
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight 
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight 

And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet
