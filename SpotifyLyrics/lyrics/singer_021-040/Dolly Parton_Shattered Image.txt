I used to sit for hours as a kid 
And dangle my feet from an old flat bridge 
Seeing myself in the water below 
Shatter my image with the rocks I'd throw 
Shatter my image with the rocks I'd throw 
Long time gone and a long time ago 
When I shattered my image with the rocks I'd throw 
The world is cruel and people are cold 
Now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw 
Shatter my image with the rocks they throw 

I'm far from perfect but I ain't all bad 
And it hurts me more than it makes me mad 
We all do things that we don't want told 
And we all throw stones that we shouldn't throw 
You shatter my image with the rocks you throw 

Long time gone and a long time ago 
When I shattered my image with the rocks I'd throw 
The world is cruel and people are cold 
Now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw 
Shatter my image with the rocks they throw 

If you live in a glass house don't throw stones 
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own 
Look at your reflection in your house of glass 
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash 
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash 

Long time gone and a long time ago 
When I shattered my image with the rocks I'd throw 
The world is cruel and people are cold 
Now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw 
Shatter my image with the rocks they throw 

Shatter my image with the rocks you throw 
Don't shatter my image with the rocks you throw
