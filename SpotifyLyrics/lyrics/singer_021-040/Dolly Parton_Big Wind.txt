Big wind big wind's comin'
From daylight till dusk we've been a workin' in the dust
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side
Oh I can't forget I still remember yet the way my daddy looked at me and cried
Big wind's a comin' listen to the hummin' hurry up now be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all

I ran across the field so scared my lips was scaled
To warn my mom to storm was on its way
Now I knew I'd won the race when I'd see my mama's face
And the way she looked at me and said
Big wind's a comin'...

Oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
The wind was blowin' trees were fallin'
And outside I heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'
It seemed I could still hear him sayin'
Big wind's a comin'...
Big wind big wind's comin'
