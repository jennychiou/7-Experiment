Does he make you laugh when he's texting you at night?
'Cause I would, I would
Don't need no money, no honey, I just need you
Get down get crazy cause baby you need me too
Let's hit the city, come with me
Yeah I'll show you a thing or two

I will love you longer, I will kiss you softer
I can give you every thing you need
I would hold you tighter, make your smile wider
If you just left him for me
Girl you can't deny that we're two of a kind
I swear we'll be one thing
Don't you see how perfect t would be?
If you left him for me
If you left him for me
If you left him for me

Does he make you mix tapes when you've had a bad day?
'Cause I would, I would
Does he pull you closer when you're feeling alone girl?
'Cause I would, I would

Don't need no money, no honey, I just need you
Get down get crazy cause baby you need me too
Let's hit the city, come with me
Yeah I'll show you a thing or two

I will love you longer, I will kiss you softer
I can give you every thing you need
I would hold you tighter, make your smile wider
If you just left him for me
Girl you can't deny that we're two of a kind
I swear we'll be one thing
Don't you see how perfect t would be?
If you left him for me
If you left him for me
If you left him for me

If you left him for me
If you left him for me
If you left him for me
