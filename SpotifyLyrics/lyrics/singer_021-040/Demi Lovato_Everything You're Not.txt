I've been bruised and I've been broken
Can't believe that I put up with all this pain
I've been used and I was choking
On the promise, I would never fall again, mm

I used to sing to your twisted symphony
The weights that had me trapped inside your misery
But now I know the reason why I couldn't breathe

'Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, don't care what you say
'Cause all I really, all I really want is everything you're not

Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
(Everything you're not, not, not)
Never wanna feel this way again

Your darkness was my weakness
But it turns out that it only went so deep, deep
A meaningless diversion
That is all that you ever meant to me, me, me, me

And I am done with your twisted symphony
The words that had me sound like stolen poetry
I tore the pages and I can finally breathe

'Cause all I want I everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, don't care what you say
'Cause all I really, all I really want is everything you're not

Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again

I want a gentleman who treats me like a queen
I need respect, I need love, nothing in between
I will not spell it out for you if you can't see
'Cause you're not worth it, you don't deserve me
And now I'm gone...

Everything you're not, not, not
Everything you're not, not, not

1, 2, 3!

'Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, don't care what you say
All I really, all I really want is everything you're not

Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
Never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh

Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
Never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh

Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
Never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh
