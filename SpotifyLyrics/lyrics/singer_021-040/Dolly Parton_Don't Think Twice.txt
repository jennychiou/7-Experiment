Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now

When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travellin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right

There ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
There ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talkin' anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right
Nah, don't think twice, don't think twice, It's all right

But there ain't no use in callin' out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in callin' out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore

Well, I'm thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's all right

So now I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a word, babe
So I'm gonna say fare thee well

But now I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better but now I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's all right
No, don't think twice, don't think twice, it's all right
Don't think twice, don't think twice, it's all right.
