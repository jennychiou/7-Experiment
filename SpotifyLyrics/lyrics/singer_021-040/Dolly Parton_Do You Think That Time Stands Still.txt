You left you didn't say goodbye
You never gave me a reason why
My tears are dried now it's been a while
Now there you szand you're back again

Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
Things have changed I've rearranged so many things
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
It never has it never will do you think that time stands still

You won't to start where we left off
Somebody found the love you lost
Love has its price we've paid the cost
We lose and learn now it's your turn

Do you think that time stands still...
Do you think that time stands still...
Oh do you think that time stands still...
