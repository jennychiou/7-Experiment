Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone 
I can still remember Mama washing on a rub board 
On the back porch, while us kids played in the yard 
Mama always seemed to be so happy and content 
She never seemed to mind that times were hard 

She went about her work singin' some old favorite song of hers 
And often singin' favorite songs for us 
And she was satisfied just bein' Mama to us children 
And the only woman Daddy ever loved 

Take me back to Mama's bosom 
Back to Daddy's lovin' arms 
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone 

I can still remember us a runnin' to meet Daddy 
In the evening when his working day was done 
When Daddy saw us comin' he would bend his tired old back 
Holdin' out his arms, and into them we'd run 

And he'd hold us for a minute, we'd all walk home together 
While Mama waited for him at the door 
And he was satisfied just bein' Daddy to us children 
And the man my Mama lived her whole life for 

Take me back to Mama's bosom 
Back to Daddy's lovin' arms 
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone 
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone
