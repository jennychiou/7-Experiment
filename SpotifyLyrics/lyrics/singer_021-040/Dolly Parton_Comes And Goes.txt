Now and then here and there I still see you
Sometimes my mem'ry lets me hear your voice so soft and low
But like the wind you travel in you seem to come and go
At times my mind is crystal clear and then I think of you
Then the spin of the room I'm in brings you into view
Love that once held my mind completely in control
Now makes it spin like tornado winds as it comes and goes

Well look who's here I told myself that you'd be coming soon
I hope that you can stay for a little while I'm so lonesome in this room
And you look just the same today do you still love me so
What's that you say you can't stay you seem to come and go
At times my mind is crystal clear...
