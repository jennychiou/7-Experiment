Life's like poetry and in my poem bay 
Until now there's always been a missing line 
You know life's too short to hide a good thing you feel 
And I find the morning after 
Is the best time to determine if it's real 
Baby, finding you gave my whole world reason to rhyme 
Cause life's like poetry and in my poem bay 
Until now there's always been a missing line 
Life's too short to think about right or wrong 
And the only thing I wonder 'bout 
Is where you been so long 
Cause baby finding you gave my whole world reason and rhyme 
And life's like poetry and in my poem bay 
Until now there's always been a missing line 
Until now, there's always been a missing line
