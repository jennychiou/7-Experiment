Now, people say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I'll tell a joke or two.
Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty,
Deep down inside I'm blue.
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you'll look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.

I need you, need you.
But since you left me if you see me with another guy,
Seemin' like I'm havin' fun.
He might look good it's true
But he's a substitute 'cause you were the perfect one.

So take a good look at my face.
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.

I need you, I need you.
Outside I'm masqueradin',
'Cause inside my hope is fading.
Like a clown since you put me down,
And my smile is my makeup I wear since my break up with you.

So take a good look at my face.
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.

Oh, just take a good look at my face.
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
