You jark back your hand away from mine
And I move my lips away from yours
Then quietly we sit trying to forget
Those deep running thoughts that run wild across our minds

You quickly stop the words you start to say
And we realize just how close we are
And we both know if we let ourselves go
We'll do something we'll be sorry for

Slip away today means sorrow tomorrow
It's love we know but we can't keep but yet we like to borrow
Trying to hold back emotions and desires
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for

My love hungry heart begs for more
Of what your lips hold in store
But our conscience just won't let us at least tonight it kept us
From jumping off the deep end and going too far

But one of these nights you and I
Will be ruled by the passion of our hearts
And we both know that we let ourselves go
And do something that we'll be sorry for

Slip away today means sorrow tomorrow...
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for
