Put your brave face on
The one you wore when you stole my heart
Would you hold my hand
We'll jump together into anything that could possibly happen

'Cause we're still so young
Ask me to dance in this hotel room
And let's get out of here
And hit the airport with nothing but a carry-on between us

You take my over analyse away
It's you and me against the world today

Feels like I'm running with my high heels on
And they're chasing us waiting for it all to go wrong
You're my umbrella against the sticks and stones
As long as we keep smiling, they'll never know
Put your brave face on

Put your brave face on

It's clear blue skies, flying thirty thousand feet above
No one can touch us 'cause we're so in love
Look in to my eyes - meet me there
Don't look down

Feels like I'm running with my high heels on
And they're chasing us waiting for it all to go wrong
You're my umbrella against the sticks and stones
As long as we keep smiling, they'll never know
Put your brave face on

Put your brave face on

You take my over analyse away
It's you and me against the world today

Feels like I'm running with my high heels on
And they're chasing us waiting for it all to go wrong
You're my umbrella against the sticks and stones
As long as we keep smiling, they'll never know
Put your brave face on

Put your brave face on
