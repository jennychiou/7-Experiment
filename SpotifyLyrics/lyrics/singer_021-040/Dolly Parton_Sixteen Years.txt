In a pickup truck we bought in 1962
And paid each month till it belonged to me and you
The cardboard boxes in the back hold everything we own
Things we've saved for sixteen years to start a brand new home

We're holding sixteen years of love in cardboard boxes
Sixteen years of laughter sweat and tears
We've stacked the back with happiness sadness love and cheer
Things we've saved together sixteen years

We sold our little dreamhouse on a small six acre farm
And said goodbye to friends we'll miss and fields of golden corn
In our search for city life where pay is big and jobs are fine
Sixteen years of love and tears following behind

We're holding sixteen years of love...
