I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna run away
Run away with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitchen light
I'd tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away in the overnight

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
'Cause I packed my clothes up
My dad was a man without plans of attack and tends to show that
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us are saints
I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces and hope that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
