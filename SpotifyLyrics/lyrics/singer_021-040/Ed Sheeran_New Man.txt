I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, 'cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man, 'cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Positive that he don't wanna know about
Positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man
