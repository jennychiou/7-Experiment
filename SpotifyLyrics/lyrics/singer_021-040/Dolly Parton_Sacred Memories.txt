Sacred memories often take me
To the place where I grew up
And that little country church
That I loved so much
I used to go there every time
That old church bell would ring
And I remember how I loved the songs we used to sing
Like "Oh Lord d'you know
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

They were singin' "Lord I'm Comin' Home"
When I got saved
And when I got baptised they sang "Amazing Grace"
And oh how sweet the sound when everybody would join in
And sing my favourite song, "If We Never Meet Again"

Where the charming roses bloom
Forever
And when separation comes no more
If we never meet again
This side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

My Mama loved to sing
And she sang clear and loud
I can close my eyes and I hear Mama now
I recall a song my Mama always loved so much
She always sang the loudest singin' "Power In The Blood"

Oh there's power
Power
Wonder workin' power
In the blood
Of the lamb
There is power
Power
Wonder workin' power
In the precious blood of the lambs
