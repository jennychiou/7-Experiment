If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death will never end this love of mine
I have loved you for so long
With a love most true and strong
You have all I may request
And I'll love you good or bad
Where you go I'll come with you
No matter where you take me to
I'll go to hell
And back again
I'll be with you
Until the end
If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death will never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you...
