This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first, 'cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love, my head up, there's no forgetting you
You've awoken me, but you're choking me, I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly I've got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby I loved you dangerously
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things change, cause now you're the train, and I'm tied to the track
You've awoken me, but you're choking me, I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly I've got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips quick goodbye
I see you now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you, I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Oh now, I knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh baby I loved you dangerously

Oh, I loved you dangerously
Oh, oh, I loved you dangerously
