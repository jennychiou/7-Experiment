The thrill, the desire, the excitement is gone 
We seem to have found a safe comfort zone 
We worked so hard to get where we are 
That romance got lost on the way 
It used to be never enough 
We'd melt with each look and each burning touch 
We laughed and we loved and we just ate it up 
Back when we were hungry that way 

Let's love like we're hungry again 
Bring back the passion we had back then 
The time has gone by, we forgot what it meant 
Lets love like we're hungry again 

Don't you miss those feelings we had at the start 
And that fire that got started from each little spark 
Oh it's good where we are, but I miss where we've been 
Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then 

Lets love like we're hungry again 
Bring back the passion we had back then 
The time has gone by, now we've grown too content 
Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then 
Lets love like we're hungry again
