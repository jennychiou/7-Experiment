In real life I'm waking up alone
It's one more night you didn't make it home
And one more time you won't pick up the phone
In real life you never bring me flowers
When you're here it's only for an hour
I'm getting used to being on my own

Because in (Real life)
You're not what I thought
(Real life) This isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem

But in my dreams, I'm, waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams you're, standing right beside me
Two hearts, finally colliding
Then I wake up and realize, realize
This is real life
(Real life)
This is real life
(Real life)
Real life
(Real life)
Whoa whoa whoa oh
(Real life)

In real life, it doesn't always work out
People fall, and loving then they fall out
Hearts can break and never make a sound

Because in (Real life)
You're not what I thought
(Real life) This isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem

But in my dreams, I'm, waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, you're, standing right beside me
Two hearts, finally colliding
Then I wake up and realize, realize
This is real life

Just when I thought this was all real life could be, yeah, yeah
Somebody came along and made the dream reality

And now in real life, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, he's, standing right beside me
Two hearts, finally colliding
When I wake up, I realize, realize
This is real life.
