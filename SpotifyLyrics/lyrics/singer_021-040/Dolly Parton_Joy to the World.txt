Joy to the world the Lord is come let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth the Savior reigns let men their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy

Joy to the world...

He rules the world with truth and grace and makes the nation prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love and wonders of his love
And wonders wonders of his love

Joy to the world...
