I see the future without you
The hell was I doing in the past
Now that I've learned all about you
A love just like ours wouldn't last

I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say

That you don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore

Money won't pay for your problems
You gotta fix them yourself
Vices and pity won't soft them
Stop feeling bad for yourself

I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say

That you don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore

I'm sorry for honesty
I could not bare to lie to you, to lie with you
I'm sorry for honesty
I'm well aware I lie to you when I lie with you

You don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me, don't do it for me
No, you don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore
