I love you so
I hold you close and I'll never let go
For all the times that you've run, you should know
That time isn't a safe place to hide
No matter how fast it runs away
When love's what you're feeling inside
You felt it from the start
I love you with all of my love
With all of my heart

Words are a friend
To someone who's scared to love again
So I'm gonna say them to you, maybe then
You can say what you're feeling inside
Cause love's not a taunting child
That laughs at you and makes you cry
I won't take you apart
I love you with all of my love
With all of my heart
I love you with all of my love
With all of my heart

So hold on and hold close
And think of what could be
If you cared and were not scared
To say you love me

It's hard to believe
'Cause I was the one who loves and then leaves
Yet here I am, holding you, won't you see
That I needed to love you so bad
But I was afraid to give myself
And lose any pride that I had
I love you from the start
I love you with all of my love
With all of my heart

I love you with all of my love,
With all of my heart
I love you with all of my love
With all of my heart
