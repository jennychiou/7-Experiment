You were poor 
So that I might enjoy 
The wealth of Your creation 
You were punished 
For all my mistakes 
So I'd be declared not guilty 
By association 
You took all that I am heir to 
And gave me all that belonged to You 
What more could anyone do? 

When I accepted You 
I never realized 
That I'd be accepted, too 
It took awhile to see 
That You bore God's rejection 
So He'd never turn away from me 
I never knew 
I would receive so much 
When I accepted You 
Accepted You 

You met death 
So that I might know life 
And eternal restoration 
You took on the world 
So the likeness of God 
Could be drawn upon my being 
Like a blood relation 
The deepest needs my lifetime through 
Were all met on the cross by You 
What more could anyone do? 

When I accepted You 
I never realized 
That I'd be accepted, too 
It took awhile to see 
That You bore God's rejection 
So He'd never turn away from me 
I never knew 
I would receive so much 
When I accepted You 
When I accepted You 
Oh, I never knew 
I would receive so much 
When I accepted You 
Accepted You 
Accepted You
