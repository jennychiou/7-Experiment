Feels so different, I'm cool with it

Million kids out there like me
On the dance floor, wanna be free
Something 'bout getting lost in the crowd
You can't hear problems 'cause the music's too loud

I don't care what people be sayin'
I'm gonna do things my own way
Original, no Xerox copy
Leader, not a follower so back up off me

If you're from the rhythm nation
Let me hear you all say, hey, ya
Join in on the conversation
Put your two cents and say, hey, ya

I don't worry 'bout tryin' to fit in
Long as you're cool we can be friends
I'm a little bit of this, a little bit of that
Best of both worlds all over the map

I'm just a regular guy
I ain't even gonna lie
I'm trying to figure it out
What this life thing's all about

If you're from the rhythm nation
Let me hear you all say, hey, ya
Join in on the conversation
Put your two cents and say, hey, ya

Why you gotta place me in a category?
I'm just trying to be me and that's all I can be
It's only half of the story but if you'll read to the end
Maybe then you'll begin to understand me
