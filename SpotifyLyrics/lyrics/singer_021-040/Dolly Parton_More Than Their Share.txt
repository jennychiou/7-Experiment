I give an inch and you take a mile and you tell me to jump and I just ask how high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
And someone must always give more than their share
I say I'm sorry when the fault is not mine
And I take the blame for our fights all the time
I love you so much and it doesn't seem fair
That someone must always give more than their share
I know you well enough to know you would never admit you were wrong
And you know me well enough to know I give in cause my love is so strong
If I give an inch and you take a mile if you tell me to jump well I just ask how high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
Cause someone must always give more than their share
Yes someone must always give more than their share
