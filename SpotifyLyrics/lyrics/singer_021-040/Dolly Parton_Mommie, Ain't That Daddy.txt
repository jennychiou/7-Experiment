The snow was fallin' swiftly and it mounted on the street 
Little footprints in the snow made by our children's feet 
As I walked them to the good will store to get some clothes to wear 
As we turned around the corner I saw you standing there 
I tried to turn the children and walk the other way 
I prayed they hadn't seen you then I heard the baby say 
"Mommie, ain't that Daddy holding out his hand 
Begging for money from that other man?" 

They asked me "Ain't that Daddy?" 
And "Yes" I had to say 
And I wondered if I'd failed you 
And made you turn this way 

No, you didn't fail me, my weakness was just too strong 
Because you see, I thought more of the bottle than our family and our home 
No, you didn't fail me sweetheart, you loved me all you could 
You had my babies and you loved me like no other woman ever would 

You know I guess I'd be better off dead 
Than in the awful ship I'm in 
But death just don't seem to have a place for those that stay drunk on whiskey, wine and gin 
You see I die a constant death over and over every day 

If I could change, you know I'd do it for you, the babies and our home 
But you might as well forget me for I'm just too forward gone 
But I wish you would do me one last favor and do it just for me 
When they ask you, "Momma ain't that Daddy?" 
Just say "It used to be"
