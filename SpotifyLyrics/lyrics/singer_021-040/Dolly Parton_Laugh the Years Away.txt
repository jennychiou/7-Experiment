A corporation owns the factory I work in
Someone else owns the house we call our home
The bank owns the car we drive around
And we've got something we can call our own

We've got love happiness surrounds us
And we thank the Lord for every single day
And with love we'll always have each other
And together we can laugh the years away

We're so thankful for our lovely children
And I work hard to keep new shoes upon their feet
But sometimes they've not too much on our table
But we've got something that's mighty hard to feed

We've got love happiness surrounds us...
We've got love happiness surrounds us...
