I'll travel lady a lotta miles just to find love
I'll do any and everything for your love
And all I need to do is give you my heart
To show you there's a deeper side to me

'Cause I've been so far and looked so hard
I'll never stop till I find what I'm looking for
See I been lost several times before
But I will search forever

I'm willing to go
To the end of the world
Even if it takes all my life
Just to find you girl
I'm willing to go
Willing to go
I'm willing to go
Willing to go
I'm willing to go
I'm willing to go
To the end of the world

Listen baby you know I'll take any transport
Take a train, a car, even a love boat
Baby I would fly across the globe
As long as it leads to you

'Cause I've been so far and looked so hard
I'll never stop till I find what I'm looking for
See I been lost several times before
But I will search forever

I'm willing to go
To the end of the world
Even if it takes all my life
Just to find you girl
I'm willing to go
Willing to go
I'm willing to go
Willing to go
I'm willing to go
I'm willing to go
To the end of the world

Oh I don't mind if it takes all my life
'Cause girl it's worth the time
Tryin' to find your love oh

I'm willing to go
To the end of the world
Even if it takes all my life
Just to find you girl
I'm willing to go
Willing to go
I'm willing to go
Willing to go
I'm willing to go
I'm willing to go
To the end of the world
