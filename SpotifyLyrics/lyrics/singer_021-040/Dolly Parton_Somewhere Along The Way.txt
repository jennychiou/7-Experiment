Somewhere along the way we drifted apart
As we walked the road of love we lost our way
Now it's too late to start all over for there's no turning back
We lost each other somewhere along the way mhm
Somewhere along the way we neglected one another
Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
Cause once love has died it won't ever live again
Somewhere along the way we stumbled and oh and we fell
Love is not a game for fools to play
We both played and we both lost now we're both sorry and both to fault
We lost that love somewhere along the way mhm
