We're in the money
We're in the money
We've got a lot of what it takes to get along
We're in the money
The skies are sunny
Old man Depression, you are through, you done us wrong

We never see a headline 'bout a bread line today
And when we see the landlord, we can look that guy right in the eye
We're in the money
Come on, my honey
Let's spend it, lend it, send it rolling along

Gone are my blues and gone are my tears
I've got good news to shout in your ears
The silver dollar has returned to the fold
With silver you can turn your dreams to gold

We're in the money
We're in the money
We've got a lot of what it takes to get along
We're in the money
The skies are sunny
Old man Depression, you are through, you done us wrong

We never see a headline 'bout a bread line today
And when we see the landlord, we can look that guy right in the eye
We're in the money
Come on, my honey
Let's spend it, lend it, send it rolling on

We're in the money
We're in the money
We've got a lot of what it takes to get along
We're in the money
The skies are sunny
Old man Depression, you are through, you done us wrong

We never see a headline 'bout a bread line today
And when we see the landlord, we can look that guy right in the eye
We're in the money
Come on, my honey
Let's spend it, lend it, send it rolling along
