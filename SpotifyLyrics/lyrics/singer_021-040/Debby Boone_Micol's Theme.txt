Micol, there was a time for us
Long ago there was a time for us
When the fields were green and the sun was warm
And the days of love and laughter went on and on

Micol, now it's all changing
All around, I see it changing
When there's nothing left, there's nothing left to say
The laughter dies, love fades away

Like children on a swing, we floated through the summer air
A time to laugh, a time to play
But now I can't believe I see you race across the night
To give away the love I always thought was mine
Oh, it was mine

Micol, there was a time for us
Long ago there was a time for us
When the fields were green and the sun was warm
Now the day's turned cold, all the love is gone

But now I can't believe I see you race across the night
To give away the love I always thought was mine
Oh, it was mine

Micol, there was a time for us
Long ago there was a time for us
When the fields were green and the sun was warm
Now the day's turned cold, all the love is gone
