Hear the lonesome whippoorwill 
He sounds too blue to fly 
The midnight train is whining low 
I'm so lonesome I could cry 

I've never seen a night so long 
When time goes crawling by 
The moon just went behind a cloud 
To hide its face and cry 

Did you ever see a robin weep 
When leaves begin to die 
That means he's lost the will to live 
I'm so lonesome I could cry 

The silence of a falling star 
Lights up a purple sky 
And as I wonder where you are 
I'm so lonesome I could cry
