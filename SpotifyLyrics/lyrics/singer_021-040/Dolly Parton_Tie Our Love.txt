Gonna tie our love in a double knot 
'Cause these days love gets strained a lot 
To give our hearts a double shot 
Let's tie our love in a double knot 

Woah, if we want to endure 
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure 
While we're wrapped up in those ties that bind 
I want to make sure we don't unwind 

So we'll tie our love in a double knot 
'Cause these days love gets strained a lot 
To give our hearts a double shot 
Let's tie our love in a double knot 

'Cause I've got my dreams, baby you got yours 
Put it together, we got a whole lot more 
'Cause I ain't lookin' for just one night 
No, I want to make it the rest of our lives 

So lets tie our love in a double knot 
'Cause these days love gets strained a lot 
To give our hearts a double shot 
Let's tie our love in a double knot 

Woah, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

Tie our love in a double knot 
'Cause these days love gets strained a lot 
To give our hearts a double shot 
Let's tie our love in a double knot 

Tie our love in a double knot 
Let's tie our love in a double knot 

Tie our love in a double knot
