Why why why did you say goodbye why did you walk out on me
Cry cry cry I feel like I could die why did you go and leave me lonely

What did I do what did I say to make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me what I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you if you'll just come back home
I'll try try try as each day goes by to make you glad that you came back to me
No more goodbyes and no more tears to cry every day I'll try to make you happy

What did I do what did I say...
