If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come in side for a little lie down with me
And if we fall asleep it would be the worst thing.
But when I wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.

And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

My little bird

My little bird

And of all this thing I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You made scream but then I made you cry when I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa

My little bird

My little bird

You're my little bird...
