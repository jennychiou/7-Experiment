Daddy I feel that I must talk to you 
Are you sure this is what you want to do? 
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay 
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way 
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life 
Trying to be a good mother and wife 
And she stood by you when the rest let you down 
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now? 

I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three 
Your new love is even younger than me 
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew 
While Mama's are withered from working for you 

Mom's not young any more like your new love 
But your new love won't love you like my mama does 
You've taken her best years, so don't leave her now 
Please, Daddy say that you won't let her down
