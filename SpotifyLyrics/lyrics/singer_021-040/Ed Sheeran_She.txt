I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her
Now I'm ready to go
As strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork but harder to read

Patience's my enemy
Loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh she, knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy

Loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh she, knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand she already understands everything
"Won't you stay" she says
And she already knows how it goes 
And where she stands I'll stay, anyway

'Cause she knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself 
Oh she, knows me so well 
Oh she, knows me like I know myself
I know myself

Oh she, knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
