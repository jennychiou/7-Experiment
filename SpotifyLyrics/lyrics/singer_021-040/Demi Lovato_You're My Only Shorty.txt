"'Demi"'
Last night was crazy and today it's settin' in
Did you really mean it and could you say it again?
Oh, oh
Even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on ring, ring, ring, ring)

Love makes you crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid (Ooh yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us and hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
What you say, boy?

"'Iyaz"'
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm tellin' you the truth
Girl it's only you
You're my only
You're my only
You're my one and one and only

"'Iyaz and Demi"'

You're my only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my one and one and only

"'Demi"'
Every day and night you've got an open invitation (Whoa)
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly-y-y-y with me
I'll be your fantasy (Ooh)

You're in demand but baby, baby so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak I'll have to tell you bye-bye
I'm a put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What you say, boy?

"'Iyaz and Demi"'
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only?)
I'm tellin' you the truth
Girl it's only you
You're my only
You're my only
(Am I your only?)
You're my one and one and only.

You're my only shorty

(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only
You're my only shorty

"'Demi"'
Please, baby, please
Give me, all your attention (Say it)
Don't let my heart go seek in no other direction (Yeah)
I gotta be the only one for your affection (Oh yeah)
