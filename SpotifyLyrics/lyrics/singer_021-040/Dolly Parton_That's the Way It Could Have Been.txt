I was so excited when you asked if I could go
But mom said I'd have to ask my daddy
I met him at the front door so afraid that he'd say no
But he smiled and said, "Let mama get you ready"

In your cotton shirt and faded jeans, you came for me
And the gingham dress was all I had to wear
With a dollar in your pocket and a borrowed car
You picked a yellow daisy for my hair

That's the way it could have been

Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been

I put away my gingham for a pretty dress of white
And you wore a suit instead of faded jeans
Our wedding day was perfect and we loved away the night
Life for us was filled with lots of dreams

We bought a house upon a hill outside of town
And two young people finally settled in
And you just won't believe the little children running 'round
And they pick yellow daisies now and then

And that's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been

That's the way it could have been
