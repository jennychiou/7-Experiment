I may not climb that Everest
Win praise in others' eyes
I may not win the lottery
Win the Pulitzer Prize
I may not sail the ocean
In a blown apart canoe
But I will never, never not love you

I might not be in fashion
Might not be all that smart
Might not be that good lookin'
Not someone set apart

Might not stand in the spotlight
That shines upon the pew
But I will never, never not love you

I will never not
Light up when I see you
I will never not
Feel you through and through
There are many things
I may or may not do
But I will never, never not love you

I may not offer riches
Or make a bed to do
I may not give you many things
That you're accustomed to
I may not be worthy of you
I just hope my love will
'Cause I will never, never not love you

No matter where you are
No matter what you do
I will not be caught
Not loving you

May not set world records
But I can promise you
That I will never, never not love
You

No I will never, never not love you
