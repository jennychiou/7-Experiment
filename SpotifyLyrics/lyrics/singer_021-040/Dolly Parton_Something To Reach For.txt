Last night in the arms of a stranger I tried losing your memory
But she was just something to reach out for when I needed your arms around me
And being with her only told me how much that I really love you
And she was just something to reach out for when I needed my arms around you
Constantly reaching for something to lean on someone to comfort me since I've lost you
Reaching for something but knowing that nothing or no one could ever get me over you
And she was just something to reach out for when I needed my arms around you
