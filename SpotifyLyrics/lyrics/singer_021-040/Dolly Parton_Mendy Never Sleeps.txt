Mendy is sixteen and uncontrollable Mendy is only a child
Mendy is in with the in-crowd Mendy is ever so wild
Mendy's hair hangs straight and long Mendy feels this is a must
Mini skirts and many friends and many horrors for us

Mendy finds a plenty to do but Mendy never sleeps
Mendy slips out of the house in the evening when the sun is sinking
Mendy is out with the in-crowd Mendy is smoking and drinking
There's a different shine in Mendy's eyes
And the color is gone from her cheeks
Mendy is a swinger but Mendy never sleeps

Mendy never sleeps and Mendy is growing weak
Mendy lies lifeless and limpid are her eyes
Now oh Mendy please don't go to sleep
