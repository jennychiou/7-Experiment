Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann when are you ever coming home

Sweet Rachel Ann we've waited here through many seasons now
We've waited here but you have not returned
When you left you promised us that you'd return someday
We miss you and our love for you still burns

Our little girl who longed to see the world beyond these hills
Sweet Rachel Ann you felt you had to go
The autumn wind again has blown the last leaves from the trees
Making room for winter's ice and snow

Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann oh how we miss you since you've gone
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann when are you ever coming home

Spring had kissed the earth again wait what's that I see
Is it someone running up the path
Oh wait a minute could it be Rachel is that you
Sweet Rachel Ann have you come home at last

Rachel I hardly recognize you now you look so tired and thin
Sweet Rachel Ann you're different than before
And that world that lies beyond these hills well it's hurt you Rachel Ann
But now you're home and nothing's gonna ever hurt you not anymore

Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann our love will make you good as new again
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann
At last you have come home sweet Rachel Ann Rachel Ann
