There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control

Of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there
Is a light
In the dark
And I feel it's warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on

It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

And the freedom of falling
And the feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
And I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space

It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

And the freedom of falling
And the feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
And I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

I've watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever comin' back again
Is it ever comin' back again
Take me back to the feelin' when
Everything was left to find

It comes and goes in waves
It always does
Oh, it always does

And the freedom of falling
And the feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
