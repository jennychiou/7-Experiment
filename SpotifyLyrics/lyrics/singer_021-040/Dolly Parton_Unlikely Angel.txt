Like the Phoenix 
From the ash and dirt 
I rose up from the pain and hurt 
When I was at my very worst 
I found you 
Thought I could never love again 
When a stream of light came beaming in 
A thread of hope 
For me to spend around you 

Unlikely Angel 
Standing there in front of me 
As if you were my destiny 
Like we were always meant to be together 

Unlikely Angel 
It feels so right inside your love 
Like God has sent you from above 
To honor, cherish, and to love forever 

The smile upon your angel face 
The heaven in your eyes replace 
The hell that I've been going through 
Before you 

How long have you been there for me 
I once was blind but now I see 
A future full of hope 
How I adore you 

Unlikely Angel 
Standing there in front of me 
As if you were my destiny 
Like we were always meant to be together 

Unlikely Angel 
Oh, you never know where one might be 
In sacred halls or crowded streets 
But God has sent one straight down to me from heaven 

Unlikely Angel 
Unlikely Angel 
Unlikely Angel 
Unlikely Angel 
Hmmmm 

Unlikely Angel
