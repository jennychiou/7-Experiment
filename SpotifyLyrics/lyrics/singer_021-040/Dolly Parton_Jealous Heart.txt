Mine is a jealous heart 
Imagines things that never are 
Builds a fire from a tiny spark 
But that's the way of a jealous heart 
Sunny skies and a rosy bed 
Thorns and storm clouds up ahead 
'Cause suddenly the sky turns dark 
For those of us with a jealous heart 

Imagination runnin' wild 
Like a frantic frightened child 
Any time that we're apart 
I can't control my jealous heart 

And you know mine is a jealous heart 
And every hurt leaves a lasting scar 
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are 
When you're cursed with a jealous heart 

I love you more than words can tell 
One day's heaven two days hell 
Suspicious words like poison darts 
Spoken from my jealous heart 

Mine is a jealous heart 
Imagines things that never are 
Builds a fire from a tiny spark 
But that's the way of a jealous heart 

And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart 
And every hurt, and every hurt leaves a lasting scar 
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are 
When you're cursed with a jealous heart 

And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart 
Imagines things, imagines things that never are 
Builds a fire from a tiny spark 
But that's the way of a jealous heart
