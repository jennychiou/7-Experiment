No one can buy true love in their life
We all need someone on standby
The night drew long, you kept me strong
Now I can thank you in this song

You are my rock, you touch my soul
You brought me light, when all hope was gone
You showed me the secrets, that I could unlock
You are my brother, you are my rock

I've seen people come and go, young and old from all walks of life
They all leave a bookmark in the story that I write
Only when your luck's run out you find out who really counts

You are my rock, you touch my soul
You brought me light, when I couldn't go on
You showed me the secrets, that I could unlock
You are my brother, you are my rock

No one can buy new love in their life
We all need someone until we die
