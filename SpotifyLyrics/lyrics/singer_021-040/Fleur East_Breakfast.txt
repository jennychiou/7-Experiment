If I get too drunk,
Would you take me home?
Would you leave me in this club?
On my own?
I don't know nobody,
These are all your friends!
A couple of them looking nice,
Nice enough to buy my breakfast

I wasn't even 'bout to come tonight
But I look too good to stay inside my house
There ain't nothing left on Netflix
When I'm restless, I get reckless
But don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry

But I look too good to stay inside my house
There ain't nothing left on Netflix
When I'm restless, I get reckless
But don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, about me
Alright alright alright
Don't worry about me, about me

Don't worry about me, I'm all good
I'm a full grown, I'm on my own
If you're going home, don't take me with you
More friends are coming, I'm taking pictures
Oh, they all look delicious, they on me
So cold, I need a Zamboni
You're buying round, you're so like Mike Tyson
I'm taking shots, you're so going

No end of day, just drop your cake
We're seventeen in this school bar
Brown bag, and set tones ???
Just let the rhythm into ya'
Sounding off for my check list
My squats are 'round, so sexy
We turn up, no empty cups
We won't be home before breakfast

Don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry

Don't worry
Don't worry about me, don't worry
