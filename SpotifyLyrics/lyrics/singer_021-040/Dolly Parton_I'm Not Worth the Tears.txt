Mama didn't always have those tears in her eyes 
And daddy once was able to hold his head up high 
But now I brought disgrace to my whole family 
Now they cry, but I'm not worth 
The tears they cry for me 
I loved a boy and then I found that he just lead me on 
So in my hurt and bitterness 
I let myself go alone 
But all I did was hurt myself 
And shame my family 
And now they cry but I'm not worth 
The tears they cry for me 

No I'm not worth 
The salt in one tiny tear 
Oh why have I brought shame 
To the one I loved so dear 
I'm so sorry that I hurt them 
But they'll never know how sorry 
And now they cry but I'm not worth 
The tears they cry for me 
Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth 
The tears they cry for me
