When you need to be love, let me love you
When you need a friend, reach out to me
When you need reassuring that it's alright
Anything you need, that what I'll be

For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold

I can be the one that makes you happy
I'll be your umbrella when it rains
I will be someone that you can count on
In other words, I'll be your everything

For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold

I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
