I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day
When you knock on my door
Now every time I go to the mailbox
I gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me
You're coming to town

I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
And it's time to feel good
It's time to feel good

I used to think maybe you loved me
Now I know that it's true
But I don't want to spend my whole life
Just a waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Or just for a day, no, no
Baby I just want you back
And I want you to stay

I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
And it's time to feel good
It's time to feel good

Walking, I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
And it's time to feel good
It's time to feel good, now
