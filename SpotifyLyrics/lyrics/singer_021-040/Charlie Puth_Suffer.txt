Detonate-Detonator
Baby you, you blow my mind
You'll tell me wait, wait on ya
But baby I can't wait all night
I go through pictures inside my phone
Won't stop tempting me
You know what I want
Wanna make, wanna make love
Girl I can't lie

I'm just a sucker
For a cold hearted lover
You make me suffer
You make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer

So here we go, go again
It's like I'm caught under your spell
You're wearing black, black magic
Oh baby don't wear nothing else
When I open up this door, don't you play
Ain't no other man going to make you feel the same
Wanna make, wanna make love
Girl I can't lie

I'm just a sucker
For a cold hearted lover
You make me suffer
You make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer

I hate when
You get your way
But we love you we love you baby
So please don't ever change
You make me suffer baby
You oh

I'm just a sucker
For cold hearted lover
You make me suffer
You make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
