I met you and we married we planned our future well
We built our home on happiness then suddenly it fell
It wasn't long there after our love began to tilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built

First came the weekly parties that never seemed to end
And then came the heartbreak brought by so-called friends
I guess that I'm as much to blame and while we share the guilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built

First came the weekly parties...
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
