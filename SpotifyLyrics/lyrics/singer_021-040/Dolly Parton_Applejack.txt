He lived by the apple orchard in this little old orchard shack
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him Applejack
Now old Applejack was loved by everyone he ever knew
Applejack picked apples but he picked the banjo too

Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song, let your banjo ring

Now I'd go down to Applejack's almost everyday
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old Applejack had made
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine

Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song, let your banjo ring

That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
All I have are memories, old Applejack is gone
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
And every time I play it, I still hear Applejack

Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song, let your banjo ring

Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song, let your banjo ring

Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
