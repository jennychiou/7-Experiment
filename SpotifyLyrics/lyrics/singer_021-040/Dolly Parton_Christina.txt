Christina our first born you are so soft and warm as you lie between us softly sleeping
We gaze in admiration at God's tiny creation
And thank him and ask for your safe keeping
You were conceived through love you are a part of us
Christina you are a dream come true
We'll place you in God's hands and place you in our plans
Christina we'll take good care of you
And as we watch you grow we will always let you know how much we love you Christina
We'll take pride in all you do and we will always stand by you
Because we love you Christina Christina

You made our house a home brought joy we've never known Christina we love you so
With innocence sweet and fair blue eyes and angel hair
Through the years we'll watch you as you grow
We'll hold your little hand we'll love you all we can
We'll try to teach you right from wrong
You are God's gift to us we can't thank him enough
For letting us have you for our own
And as we watch you grow...
Christina
