Hey
Hoo

Love is a strange thing
It sets you on fire
It keeps you burning day and night
There's no doubt that you're alive
Love is a cold thing
Suddenly frozen
Tearing your heart into a million
Piece by piece

All my friends say It wasn't true love
I shouldn't waste my tears on you but
They don't know that I
I only miss you when I breathe

Oh oh
I only miss you when I breathe
Oh
I only miss you when I didn't think I'd say but I
Only miss you when I breathe
Oh

Love is delusion
Often to see things
It's magic how it feels when you fall head over heels
Leaving you broken, leaving you bruised
But love is a power
Making you stronger
So why do I always

Only miss you when I breathe
Oh oh
I only miss you when I breathe
Oh
I only miss you when I didn't think I'd say it but I
Only miss you when I breathe
Oh oh

Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh

All my friends say It wasn't true love
I shouldn't waste my tears on you but
They don't know that I
Only miss you when I breathe
Yeah

I only miss you when I breathe (Oh)
I only miss you when I breathe
Oh oh

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (I only miss you when I breathe)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (I only miss you when I breathe)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
