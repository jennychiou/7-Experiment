I saw him at the corner store
He gave me candy
I came back for more
I asked for his name
He said call me J for James
He was 6'2 lots of style
He had the recipe to make you smile
But he got too popular with the girls
So I erased him from my world

The next boy was cute and shy
But he never really looked me in the eye
Secretive I was intrigued
He was sweet, his name was Pete (Sweet Pete)
First time that he took me out
I didn't know what to talk about
So I took the initiative
And told Pete he had to leave

So I'm back to square one
With Mr Good For Nothing John
Ever since he brought me down
I can't get off the ground
It's not like I don't try
And I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave
Is the one that got away
With each boy he gets worse
But I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say
I want the one that got away

He's the star of the football team
Can be found in every girl's dream
We've been talking for a while
You could say that he's on trial
But whenever we're alone
His jaw's like a gramophone
When he goes off the field
With him goes his appeal

So I'm back to square one
With Mr Good For Nothing John
Ever since he brought me down
I can't get off the ground
It's not like I don't try
And I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave
Is the one that got away
With each boy he gets worse
But I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say
I want the one that got away

Here she goes again
With another boy on her hands
Word goes around
Real fast in this small town
All these rumors like I'm a stark
Just wanna find
Someone to give my heart
No luck with James, Pete or the football stud
None of them can compare
None of them can compare
To my John

It's not like I don't try
And I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave
Is the one that got away
With each boy he gets worse
But I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say
I want the one that got away

I want the one that got away
