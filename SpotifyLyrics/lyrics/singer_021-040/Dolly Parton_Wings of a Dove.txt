On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak, the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, he doesn't forget us
He sends down his love on the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When Noah has drifted on the flood many days
The searchers for land in various ways
Troubles he had some but wasn't forgotten
He sent him his love on the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When Jesus went down to the river that day
He was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed his son
He sent him his love on the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
