Packin' my suitcase writin' a tear stained good-bye note
Sayin' so long to a love gone wrong and that's all she wrote
Leavin' behind what once was mine with sad regrets
But it's all gone now and I'm leavin' town on the Heartbreak Express
Walkin' in the rain with a heart full of pain to the train depot
The only things that's gonna keep me warm now is my overcoat
Lost and lonely waitin in line at the ticket desk
Hey mister won't you give me a one-way ticket on the Heartbreak Express

I'm gonna roll on down the line
I'm gonna go so far I'm gonna get it off my mind
It hurts to know it ain't enough when you give your best
Got a ticket to ride and I'm leavin' tonight on the Heartbreak Express

Oh I couldn't hold a candle to a flaming beauty that caught his eye
It's killin' me now but I won't stay around and let him watch me die
Oh it just goes to show you never do know 'cause I never would'a guessed
I'd be sittin' here now on a train sorrow bound called the Heartbreak Express

I'm gonna roll on down the line
I'm gonna go so far I'm gonna get it off mt mind
Maybe someday somewhere someway I will forget
But there's no goin' back so roll down the track you ole Heartbreak Express
Feelin' alone while a low whistle moans
On the Heartbreak Express
