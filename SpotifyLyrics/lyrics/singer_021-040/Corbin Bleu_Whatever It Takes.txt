Whatever it takes, whatever it takes

Stand outside your place down on my knees
In the pourin' rain if that's what you need
To see that I ain't, ain't tryna be here for a day but for eternity
Not playin' no games, I wish you would see
Just tryin' to get you on the same page

If you feel half of what I feel then you know it's kinda scary
To need somebody else but this love is necessary
It's keepin' me alive, it's why my heart is beatin'
And it's why I gotta try to get you with me, so baby

I'll do whatever it takes
And I ain't gonna quit it until you're here with me
I'll do whatever it takes
If there's anybody out there feelin' the same let me hear you say
Whatever it takes, I'll do whatever it takes

I'd spend it all, buy diamonds and pearls
It'd be worth the fall if you were my girl
Just say you'll play along and I'll give you the world
I just need you near me, don't care how much it hurts

I'm so determined, I swear I'll make it work
It'll be all about you, I'll put you first

If you feel half of what I feel then you know it's kinda scary
To need somebody else but this love is necessary
It's keepin' me alive, it is why my heart is beatin'
And it's why I gotta try to get you with me, so baby

I'll do whatever it takes
And I ain't gonna quit it until you're here with me
I'll do whatever it takes
If there's anybody out there feelin' the same let me hear you say
Whatever it takes, I'll do whatever it takes

If you feel half of what I feel then you know it's kinda scary
To need somebody else but this love is necessary
It's keepin' me alive, it is why my heart is beatin'
And it's why I gotta try to get you with me, so baby

I'll do whatever it takes
And I ain't gonna quit it until you're here with me
I'll do whatever it takes
If there's anybody out there feelin' the same let me hear you say
Whatever it takes, I'll do whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, I'll do whatever it takes
