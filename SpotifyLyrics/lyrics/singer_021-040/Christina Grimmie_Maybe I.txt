Struggle just to breathe here
Living in a concrete carnival
Everything that you see here
Is just a dirty little plastic price for your soul
Take a look at the cracks in the road
Like the wreckage of your heart
When a lover goes
And if you can't love yourself
Then you're never gonna rise above

No magic words you can say
Maybe I'm not alone
Caught up in this great unknown
You know, maybe I'm the crazy one
Going, going, gone
Maybe I'm not afraid
I'm already tempting fate (oh)
This is what I want, so bring it on, and on, and on

We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough

Tryna find a balance
But it's like I'm standing on a Tilt-A-Whirl
Always looking down when
Everything around me starts to crumble and fall
Negative is a merry-go-round
And it feels so good till you hit the ground
And if you can't love yourself
Then you're never gonna rise above

No magic words you can say
Maybe I'm, not alone
Caught up in this great unknown
You know, maybe I'm the crazy one
Going, going, gone
Maybe I'm, not afraid
I'm already tempting fate (oh)
This is what I want so bring it on, and on, and on

We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough

It's a high when you're low
It's a yes but then it don't
It ain't what you think, it's what you know
And I know
Yeah-eah-yeah

Maybe I'm, not alone
Caught up in this great unknown
You know, maybe I'm the crazy one
Going, going, gone
Maybe I'm, not afraid
I'm already tempting fate (oh)
This is what I want so bring it on, and on, and on

We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
No, we just can't get enough
