Sound of the rain on the roof of my car
It haunts me in my sleep
Passengers side wearing that red scarf
That I got you for our anniversary

That's where you sat when you said to me
You think that space is what you need
Time to decide where you wanna be
So now every time that it rains

I get lonely, I begin to miss your touch
I get lonely, start to reminisce a lot
I get lonely as if rain isn't sad enough
Every time it starts to rain on me I get lonely

You had a smile like summertime
And hair like a gentle breeze
A sudden change in the weather
Now you are no longer with me

You wanted space, I gave the universe
You wanted time, I gave eternity
Tears of the sky remind me of the hugs
So now every time that it rains

I get lonely, I begin to miss your touch
I get lonely, start to reminisce a lot
I get lonely as if rain isn't sad enough
Every time it starts to rain on me I get lonely

Wicked memories playing with my mind
Leave me mentally solitarily confined
You took a part of me and I am not the same
Constantly reminded by the rain

I get lonely, I begin to miss your touch
I get lonely, start to reminisce a lot
I get lonely as if rain isn't sad enough
Every time it starts to rain on me I get lonely

I get lonely, I get so lonely
Every time it starts to rain on me I get lonely
