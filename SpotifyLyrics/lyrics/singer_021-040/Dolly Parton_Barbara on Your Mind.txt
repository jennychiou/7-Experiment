Last night you called me Barbara 
As you lay fast asleep 
And although I'm not Barbara 
You wanted me to be 
You whispered words I haven't heard 
In such a long, long time 
Last night you said I love you 
With Barbara on your mind 
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin 
And strands of chestnut hair 
That say you've been with her again 
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find 
Last night you called me darlin' 
With Barbara on your mind 

With Barbara on your mind 
You held me in your arms so tight 
And lying there so close to you 
I cried until day light 

And though you think that I don't know 
I'm really not that blind 
Last night you said I love you 
With Barbara on your mind 
Last night you called me darlin' 
With Barbara on your mind
