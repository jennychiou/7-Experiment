You're the sweetest one I know 
And I just can't let you go 
I just dream of holding you inside my arms

I go home each night to stay 
But I just can't stay away 
And we get closer, closer by the hour

We get closer by the hour 
Though we tried with all our power 
To stay away from each other's arms 
We get closer by the hour 
Like the bee goes to the flower 
Closer, closer by the hour

We come closer with each kiss 
And I feel your lips insist 
That I do your will and love you more and more

Although we know it's wrong 
We can't stay where we belong 
And We get closer, closer by the hour

We get closer by the hour 
Though we tried with all our power 
To stay away from each other's arms 
We get closer by the hour 
Like the bee goes to the flower 
Closer, closer by the hour
