Down from the clouds she fell into my heart,
Now I can barely stand whenever we're apart.
Such a pretty face but a soul so dark.
Girl it must have hurt ya something terrible (oh)

But let me undo all the damage he's done to you.
Let me Fuck all the pain away and make it new.
I won't stop till your skies go from grey to blue.
Cause makin' ya smile, that's what I gotta do.

If he did you wrong I apologise.
If he did you wrong he's a foolish guy.
I swear that I can barely sleep at night,
Knowing somebody done made an angel cry.
Ooh he made an angel cry (x4)

How could anybody look into her eyes,
And not melt to the ground like a block of ice?
Maybe the last guy didn't realise,

He was talking to an angel (yeah)

But let me undo all the damage he's done to you.
Let me love all the pain away and make it new.
I won't stop till your skies go from grey to blue.
Cause makin' ya smile, that's what I gotta do.

If he did you wrong I apologise.
If he did you wrong he's a foolish guy.
I swear that I can barely sleep at night,
Knowing somebody done made an angel cry.
Ooh he made an angel cry (x4)

If he did you wrong I apologise.
If he did you wrong he's a foolish guy.
I swear that I can barely sleep at night,
Knowing somebody done made an angel cry.
Ooh he made an angel cry (x4)

He made an angel cry...
