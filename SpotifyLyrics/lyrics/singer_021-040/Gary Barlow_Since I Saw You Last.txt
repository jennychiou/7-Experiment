They took my voice
Erased my past
With all that noise
It couldn't last.

With words so cruel
I washed my face
Hoped one day
I'd wake up in a better place.

Today I took back what was stolen
And gave new life to what was frozen
One mouth talking
A dead man walking
A thousand faces watched me falling.

I've made my peace with what may happen
Accepted I won't be in fashion
Oh you gave, I got it
Yeah you gave, I got it all back
Since I saw you last.

When brothers land
And take what's good
You can win a war
Oh, and she'd no blood.

Everybody plays their part
Oh we let the haters hate
While everybody's losing heart
Lying in the longest grass I sit and wait.
Since I saw you last

Today I took back what was stolen
And gave new life to what was frozen
One mouth talking
A dead man walking
A thousand faces watched me falling.

I've made my peace with what may happen
Accepted I won't be in fashion
Oh you gave, I got it
Yeah you gave, I got it all back
Since I saw you last.

I know you heard
My shout for help
For those who stood and watched
Go fuck yourself.

I know you heard my cry for help
I know you heard I was going through hell
I know you heard I was losing my mind
I know you heard it was a matter of time.

I know you heard...
I know you heard...
I know you heard...
I know you heard...
