You (you), you make me wanna fall in love (fall in love)
You (you), it's all or nothing, I know (I know)
Gettin' lost in your blue skies
All my senses come alive
Every second amplified tonight

Gonna be sublime
So so sublime
Feel your love all over me
Can't stop thinking we could be sublime
Sublime

Feel, I feel your aura in my veins
Surreal, you're breaking through my chains
Gettin' lost in your blue skies
All my senses come alive
Every second amplified tonight

Gonna be sublime
So so sublime
Feel your love all over me
Can't stop thinking we could be sublime
Sublime

Getting so high it's celestial
Never come down to terrestrial
When you speak every decibel
It's making me feel so sublime
Vulnerable but invincible
Lucid but so irrational
Spontaneous but intentional
You're making me, feel so sublime

So so sublime
I feel your love all over me
Can't stop thinking we could be sublime (oh)
Sublime, oh no
Sublime
I feel your love all over me
Can't stop thinking we could be sublime, oh
Sublime
