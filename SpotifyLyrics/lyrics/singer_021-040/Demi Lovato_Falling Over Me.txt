I'm standing in the center of the room
I watch the boys follow girls perfume
All is as it should be I assume
Except for the distance between me and you

You're standing as a flower on the wall
The room is still but we're about to fall
And all the names that brought us here
Simply fade away

Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are is everything I need
(Who you are is everything I need)

I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one

I can't believe that night turned into today
I used the line you were supposed to say
And all the names that brought us here
Now we have to thank

Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are has got me on my knees
(Who you are has got me on my knees)

I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one

If you are I will wait I will follow
I'm here to stay
As long as we're promised tomorrow
I'll wait
Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me
Who you are has got me on my knees
(Who you are has got me on my knees)

I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I'm hoping
I'm waiting 
I'm praying you are the one

You are the one
