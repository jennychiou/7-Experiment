I met a man in Texas
And oh, he was so fine
And I said to myself
Self, I'm gonna make him mine
He owned a lot of oil wells and his bank roll sure was healthy
And I new if I married him I'd suddenly be wealthy

Oh I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear

Well I never had no money
Not a penny to my name
And I said I'd find a rich man
And I'd love my way to fame
So he took mt in his arms
And I cuddled up real near
The money bug then bit me and I wispered in his ear

Oh, I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear

He looked in to my eyes and thought he saw a love light shine
Nearly did he know that that light was dollar signs
Now that we are married there ain't nothin' left to tell
We'll live happily ever after because all is well that ends well

Oh, I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear
