How long will you love me how long will you stay by my side
Will it be for a lifetime or just for a while
From now on yes on and on
If you will love and stand by me I'll give all my love to you
That's the way that it will be from now on yes on and on
From now on yes on and on from now on yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time from now on on and on

I'll stand by you right or wrong then we'll always be as one
Like the robin needs his song I need you from now on
Like the rose loves the vine like the poem needs to rhyme
My love is yours and yours is mine from now on on and on
From now on yes on and on...
From now on on and on
