Word on the street is that you're single (so)
So baby have you heard my single?
It goes la di da and it hits like a cymbal
I drew a heart with my finger on your window

What's up?
Even with your hair up
Girl, what's up?
Even in your sweat pants
Girl, what's up?
Even when you wake up without any make-up, I'm in love

'Cause I'm
So tired of the same old things
I'ma need something new in my life, yeah
So tired of the same old games
Yeah it's time I started feeling right

Cause you-ou-ou-ou-ou, got me good girl

You-ou-ou-ou-ou, got me good
And you know that I need you so bad

You said you're talking to your ex-boy (well)
Well just remember he's your ex-boy (uh)
Well maybe I could be your next boy
And just remember that you're better than the rest

So baby, what's up?
Even in your work clothes
Girl, what's up?
You know how to work clothes
Girl, what's up?
Girl, you got me lost in your eyes, I'm in paradise
What's up?

So tired of the same old games
Yeah it's time I started feeling right

Cause you-ou-ou-ou-ou, got me good girl

You-ou-ou-ou-ou, got me good
And you know that I need you so bad

I wanna know what it feels like
To run my fingers through you hair
I wanna know what drives you wild
Cause baby we could drive it there
Tell me that I'm dreaming
No, I don't wanna wake up
No, I don't wanna wake up
