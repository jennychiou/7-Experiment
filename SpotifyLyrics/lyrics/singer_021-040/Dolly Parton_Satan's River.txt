Satan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire

But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side

Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool

Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tide

Satan's got river...
