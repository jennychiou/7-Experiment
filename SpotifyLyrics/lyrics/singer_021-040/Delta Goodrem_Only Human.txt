I’ve given my heart and can’t get it back
I’ve had too many knives thrown at my back
Wouldn’t it be easy to throw it all away
Wouldn’t it be easy to call it a day
How do you love when you’re broken
I’ve had enough
I’m only human

I can’t control what is out of my hands
God know sometimes I just don’t understand
So wouldn’t it be easy to just turn the page
Wouldn’t it be better to throw the book away
How do you love when you’re broken
I’ve had enough
I’m only human

I’ll say in time that there’s a reason and a rhyme
It’s just a season with some lessons for your life
But I wanna know
Why today got so much colder
And I wanna know
When the storm clouds will be over
I wanna love when I’m broken
I wanna love I’m only human

When I see the sun I am starting again
No matter the luck
It’s never the end
