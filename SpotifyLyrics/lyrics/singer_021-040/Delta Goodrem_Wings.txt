A beating drum
It's in my lungs
I breathe it in, it takes my breath away
I don't look back
It's just a trap
We are all one but we're not the same

Everybody's looking for a new horizon
Everybody wants to leave the world behind them
Everybody's looking for a new horizon
Everybody's looking for a second chance
Everybody's wishing they could take a stand
Everybody's looking for a second chance

What if I lose my self control
What if I choose to let it go
I want to let you and me collide
Baby these wings were made
These wings were made to fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la

The deepest veins
The darkest truth
A secret place I only want to share with you
Look in my eyes
Undress my soul

Cause everybody's looking for a new horizon
Everybody wants to leave the world behind them
Everybody's looking for a new horizon
Everybody's looking for a second chance
Everybody's wishing they could take a stand
Everybody's looking for a second chance

What if I lose my self control
What if I choose to let it go
I want to let you and me collide
Baby these wings were made
These wings were made to fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
These wings were made to
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la

What if I lose my self control
What if I choose to let it go
I want to let you and me collide
Baby these wings were made to fly
What if I lose my self control
What if I choose to let it go
I want to let you and me collide
Baby these wings were made
These wings were made to fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
These wings were made to
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la
Fly, la la la

These wings were made to fly
