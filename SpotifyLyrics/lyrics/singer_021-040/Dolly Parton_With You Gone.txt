Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone? 
Sitting in my lonely room just staring at the wall 
For lack of something else to do I count the tears that fall 
Trying to get it through my head you don't care at all 
What am I gonna do with you gone? 

What does life hold for me anymore? 
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more 
You still have the key to my heart and my door 
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone? 

I can hear the lonesome whistle of a passing train 
I can feel my heart beat a rhythm with the pouring rain 
Realizing that my life won't ever be the same 
What am I gonna do with you gone? 

Will I ever be happy again? 
With you gone my whole world has just come to an end 
Will I ever forget you, or will I forget 
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone? 

With you gone, What does life hold for me anymore? 
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more 
And you still have the key to my heart and my door 
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone? 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone?
