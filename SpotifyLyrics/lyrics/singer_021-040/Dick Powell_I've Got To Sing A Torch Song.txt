A clown can laugh when he's unhappy
Sometimes I wish I were a clown
I'd like to sing away my sorrow
Every sorrow, every frown
A lively jingle never cheers me
I sing of love, but no one hears me

I've gotta sing a torch song
For that's the way I feel
When I feel a thing that I can sing
It must be real

I couldn't sing a gay song
It wouldn't be sincere
I could never croon a happy tune
Without a tear

I have my dreams, but one by one
They vanish in the sky
I try to smile and face the sun
But romance passes by

I've gotta sing a torch song
To someone far apart
For the torch I bear is burning there
Right in my heart

When I feel a thing that I can sing
It must be real

I could never croon a happy tune
Without a tear

I have my dreams, but one by one
They vanish in the sky
I try to smile and face the sun
But romance passes by

I've gotta sing a torch song
To someone far apart
For the torch I bear is burning there
Right in my heart
