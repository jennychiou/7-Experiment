We'll sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 
I will never love you 
The cost of love's too dear 
But though I'll never love you 
I'll live with you one year 

And we will sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 

I'll sing to you each morning 
I'll kiss you every night 
But darlin', don't cling to me 
I'll soon be out of sight 

But we can sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 

My daddy he once told me 
Hey, don't you love you any man 
Just take what they can give you 
And give but what you can 

And you can sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 

And when our year has ended 
And I have gone away 
I'll often speak about you 
And this is what I'll say 

You know we sang in the sunshine 
We laughed every day 
We sang in the sunshine 
Then I went on my way
