Been living my life, in commotion
Like all the colours, bruised and broken
Black cats and ladders smoke and mirrors
7 years of bad luck made it clearer

I woke up running with a pain in my heart
Can't get there fast enough
Yeah, fast enough
No matter what I do I gotta get to you
Falling deeper in love
Yeah, deeper in love
You have got my hypnotized
Lost control and now 
I'm trippin' on this feeling going out of my mind
I'm falling deeper in love
Yeah, deeper in love with you...

Like a spell I've fallen under
Intoxicating when you're closer
Shower me with the confetti raining down
From open skies
I'm gonna cut these strings off these balloons
And watch them fly so high

I woke up running with a pain in my heart
Can't get there fast enough
Yeah, fast enough
No matter what I do I gotta get to you
Falling deeper in love
Yeah, deeper in love
You have got my hypnotized
Lost control and now 
I'm trippin' on this feeling going out of my mind
I'm falling deeper in love
Yeah, deeper in love with you...

I love standing on the edge
Looking on this brave new world
Feeling vertigo I take this step and just let go...

Something's got me mesmerized
Feels like I've been hypnotized

I woke up running with a pain in my heart
Can't get there fast enough
Yeah, fast enough
No matter what I do I gotta get to you
Falling deeper in love
Yeah, deeper in love
You have got my hypnotized
Lost control and now 
I'm trippin' on this feeling going out of my mind
I'm falling deeper in love
Yeah, deeper in love with you...

Deeper in love, deeper in love
Deeper in love with you

Deeper in love, deeper in love
Deeper in love with you
In love with you
In love with you
In love with you
