Before I fall
Too fast
Kiss me quick
But make it last
So I can see
How badly this will hurt me
When you say goodbye
Keep it sweet
Keep it slow
Let the future pass
And don't let go
But tonight
I could fall too soon
To this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me

See this heart
Won't settle down
Like a child running
Scared from a clown
I'm terrified
Of what you'd do
My stomach screams
Just when I look at you
Run far away
So I can breathe
Even though you're
Far from suffocating me
I can't set my hopes too high
Cause every hello ends with a
Goodbye

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me

So now you see
Why I'm scared
I can't open up my heart
Without a care
But here I go
It's what I feel
And for the first time in my
Life I know it's real

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
So please don't catch me
If this is love please don't break me
I'm giving up so
Just catch me
