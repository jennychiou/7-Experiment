I once was blind 
But now I see 
I took him for granted 
She took him from me 

I once had a love 
But now now I have none 
And I'm, I'm as blue as can be 
I treated him a-wrong 
And now I'm, I'm all alone 
I took him for granted 
She took him from me 

Well if I had known then 
Just what I know now 
I would've treated him so differently 
And if I, if I had known 
Well then I 
I could've shown him more love 
Than he'll ever see from her 

I thought I had his love 
In the palm of my hand 
But I, I guess she showed me 
And now I, I understand 
Just how she, she got my man 
I took him for granted 
She took him from me
