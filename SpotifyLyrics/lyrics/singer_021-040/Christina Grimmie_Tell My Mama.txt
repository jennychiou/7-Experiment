On the first day of class
You walked into the room
Just a hot little thing
With a bad attitude
And I knew, I knew
I knew you were trouble baby

I was saved by the bell
Couldn't wait to get home
And tell my mama
'Bout this boy I don't know
Yeah I knew, I knew
I knew it was complicated

Boy I know you're dangerous
You're not the one
I'm supposed to love
But this is more than just a crush
Tonight
So I'm gonna tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)

Locked myself in my room
Called you up on the phone
Don't know why I hung up
As soon as you said hello
When it's true, it's true
You got me trippin' baby

That night I couldn't sleep
Rolled around in my bed
'Cause the boy of dreams
Is a nightmare instead
And it's true, it's true
That nobody tried to save me

Boy I know you're dangerous
You're not the one
I'm supposed to love
But this is more than just a crush
Tonight
So I'm gonna tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)

I've never ever met a boy
That made me feel the way
You do, you do, you do
I said I've never ever met a boy
That made me feel the way
You do, you do, you do

Boy I know you're dangerous
You're not the one
I'm supposed to love
But this is more than just a crush
Tonight
So I'm gonna tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
I'mma tell my mama about ya
(I'mma tell her, I'mma tell her)
