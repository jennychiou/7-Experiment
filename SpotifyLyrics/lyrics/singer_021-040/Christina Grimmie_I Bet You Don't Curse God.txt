I bet you don't curse God
When the doctor calls
With a stern voice and the test results
And he asks you to come in right away

I bet you don't curse God
When you're on a plane
In a turbulence, pourin' rain
And you're hoping that you'll make it out okay

Everybody cries
We've all faked a smile
When your back's against the wall
And your hands are tied

There's pain, Life hurts
There's a thousand things
You think you don't deserve
All hope is lost
When You spend it all
And you just can't beat the odds
I bet you don't curse God
I bet you don't curse God

I bet you don't curse God
When your child is gone
And he ain't picking up the phone
And it's 2 A.M. on a Saturday in July

I bet you don't curse God
At your bottom line
And your credit cards are all declined
And you don't know where you're gonna sleep tonight

Everybody cries
We've all faked a smile
When your back's against the wall
And your hands are tied

There's pain, Life hurts
There's a thousand things
You think you don't deserve
All hope is lost
When You spend it all
And you just can't beat the odds
I bet you don't curse God
I bet you don't curse God

I bet you don't curse God
When you're dying in bed
About to take your one last breath
And you're holding on before you say goodnight

There's pain, Life hurts
There's a thousand things
You think you don't deserve
When all hope is lost
When You spend it all
And you just can't beat the odds
I bet you don't curse God
I bet you don't curse God

I bet you don't curse God
