You know I find it hard to sleep when
I'm sleeping by myself
And I'm lying in the spare room
Thinking I should be somewhere else
You should know when we've been drinking
We can sabotage ourselves
Like smashing up the kitchen
Now, there's nothing that seems to help

And I don't want to wake you up
Tell you that I'm leaving town
I already packed my stuff
Can't go back now
But the way you look brings me straight back down
I don't want to wake you up right now

I was ready to go, ready to go
I don't want to wake you up right now
I was ready to go, ready to go
I don't want to wake you up right now

You're breaking out the windows
While I was tearing down the doors
And now I'm picking up the ashtray
That you threw against the wall
'Cause we take, and we take just a little more
I have no idea what we're fighting for
No we're standing right here outside your door
Now I know, now I know

And I don't want to wake you up
Tell you that I'm leaving town
I already packed my stuff
Can't go back now
But the way you look brings me straight back down
I don't want to wake you up right now

I was ready to go, ready to go
I don't want to wake you up right now
I was ready to go, ready to go
I don't want to wake you up right now

'Cause I can't live with you, I can't live without you
You feel like home, you feel like home
'Cause I can't live with you, I can't live without you
You feel like home, you feel like home

And I don't want to wake you up
Tell you that I'm leaving town
I already packed my stuff
Can't go back now
But the way you look brings me straight back down
I don't want to wake you up right now

I was ready to go, ready to go
I don't want to wake you up right now
(Can't live with you, I can't live without you)
I was ready to go, ready to go
I don't want to wake you up right now
(Can't live with you, I can't live without you)
I was ready to go, ready to go
I don't want to wake you up right now
