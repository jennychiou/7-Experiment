If you need me, I'll be gone 

The bed's still warm where you just left 
But it'll be colder where I've slept 
I've always been where you needed me 
But I ain't the fool I used to be 

You come home all hours of the night 
The fragrance on you ain't old spice 
Tonight when you come draggin' home 
And find you need me, I'll be gone 

I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up 
Gone like the dew from the buttercup 
Gone like a woman treated wrong 
If you need me, I'll be gone 

So, what am I still doing here? 
You've been doin' me wrong for years 
Tired of pickin' up and puttin' out 
I'm leaving you lock, stock, and house 

So, bye, bye, baby 
That's it, I'm packed 
I'm a'leavin' now, but I'll call back 
And leave this message on the code-a-phone 
Sayin', if you need me, well, I'll be gone 

I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up 
Gone like the dew from the buttercup 
Gone like a woman leavin' home 
If you need me, I'll be gone 

I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up 
Gone like the dew from the buttercup 
Gone like a woman leavin' home 
If you need me, I'll be gone 

I said, if you need me, I'll be gone 

If you need me, I'll be gone 
I said, if you need me, I'll be gone
