I know there's times when you must wonder 
If my love is true, and I'm satisfied 
I wish I knew a way to show you 
I'm forever yours for the rest of my life 

I cross my heart and hope to die 
I'll always be here by your side 
My love grows stronger as the time goes by 
Cross my heart and hope to die 

And all those times we're not together 
You're in my heart and you're on my mind 
You're like a part of me that's missing 
I cross my heart and hope to die 

I cross my heart and hope to die 
I'll always be here by your side 
My love grows stronger as the time goes by 
Cross my heart and hope to die 

I cross my heart and hope to die 
I'll always be here by your side 
My love grows stronger as the time goes by 
Cross my heart and hope to die 

I cross my heart and hope to die 
I cross my heart
