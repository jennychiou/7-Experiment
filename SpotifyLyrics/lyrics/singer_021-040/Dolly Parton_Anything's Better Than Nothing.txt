Friends ask how I'll get along without you
They say it's so sad we're apart
I have to agree that I don't seem like me
I'm havin' a ball with my heart

Anything's better than nothing nothing's not too much to lose
Anything's better than nothing nothing's what I have with you

I've got to admit that it hurts me
I don't like to fight or to fuss
But now you and me are just happy we're free
And everyone's crying but us

Anything's better than nothing...
It really must be disappointment
To see love and dreams turn to smoke
I can't blame my friends when their teardrops begin
I once thought that love made a home

Anything's better than nothing...
Nothing's what I have with you...
