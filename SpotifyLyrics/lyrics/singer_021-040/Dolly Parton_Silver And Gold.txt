Well, I met an old man walkin' down the street 
His clothes were torn and tattered 
With sandals on his feet 
And I stopped to help him 
And lend him a hand 
He said, I love you so much 
But you must understand 

Silver and gold might buy you a home 
But things of this world 
They won't last you long 
And time has a way of turning us old 
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold 

And he said to me, let's rest for awhile 
For I have some good news to share with you, child 
He said, you can't change this old world 
The people need to know 
That a dear savior died here 
A long, long time ago 

Silver and gold might buy you a home 
But things of this world 
They won't last you long 
And time has a way of turning us old 
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold 

His eyes shown like diamonds 
And his smile was heaven sent 
His hair was long and flowing 
And his back was slightly bent 
And I knew he knew it 
For that day I changed 
As I watched him walk on 
I forgot to get his name 

He said, silver and gold can't buy you a home 
When this life has ended 
And your time is gone 
But you can live in a world where 
You'll never grow old 
And things can't be bought there with silver and gold 

And time can't be bought back with silver and gold
