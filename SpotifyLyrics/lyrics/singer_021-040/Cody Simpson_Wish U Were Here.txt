Lately I got this feeling
I don't know what's the meaning
But I know it's strong
And it's over you
All I want is to be home with you
Oh ooh oh
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome
Livin' without you is a
No No
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome

I wish you were here
Yeah, I wish you were here
Music is better
And lights are brighter when you are near
Am I making it clear?
The music is better
And right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here

Every night
A different city
Bright lights, should be pretty
But they can't compare, no
To the light from you
All I want right now is to be home with you
Oh ooh oh
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome
Livin' without you is a
No No
I'm coming right back
Ho-ome

I wish you were here
Yeah, I wish you were here
Music is better
And lights are brighter when you are near
Am I making it clear?
The music is better
And right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here

I can't wait till you come back home
I know it's late, hoped you were by the phone
It so hard gettin' by all alone
So call me back, leave a message at the tone
I know, you know, I know we can make it by
It's been too long since I've looked into your eyes
And I'm waitin', so hurry back
Bring the shine boy
You better follow the path
Car, bus, train, go and get a cab
Or just fly here- Jet pack
Roger that, do you copy?
I was a puzzle piece but you solved me
Our future, I see it so clear
And right now...

I wish you were here
Yeah, I wish you were here
Music is better
And lights are brighter when you are near
Am I making it clear?
The music is better
And right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
Oh ooh oh
Right now I just wish you were here
