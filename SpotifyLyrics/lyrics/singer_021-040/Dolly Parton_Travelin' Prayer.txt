Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be all right
Things gonna be all right with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
And make sure all his dreams are sweet
Send down that ya got him on the road
But you'll make it softer for his feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be all right
Till he's home and here with me

Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is sleeping under the sky
Hey Lord, make sure the ground he's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Ooh, don't give him too much pain
And keep him away from planes
Cause my baby hates to fly

Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For it gets rough along the way
And if it all sounds strange
Just because I don't know how to pray
Ooh, won't you give him peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Tell him I miss him everyday

Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where he's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be all right
Till he's home and here with me
Here with me
