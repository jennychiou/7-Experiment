If I had wings
I'd fly away from all-a my troubles
All-a my pain
And I would fly to a place of comfort
Heaven knows I need a change
If I had wings, Lord give me wings

Oh, I've had my share of sorrow
Walked a long and lonesome road
I could use a new tomorrow
If I had wings, I'd make it so
One cannot predict the future
One cannot undo the past
But we can make the present useful
Build a future that will last

If I had wings
I'd fly away from all-a my troubles
All-a my woes
And I would fly 'til I found freedom
If I bad wings, I'd up and go
If I had wings, Lord give me wings
(Oh-oh, mm-mm, oh-oh)

If I had wings
I'd fly away from all-a my troubles
All-a my woes
And I would fly 'til I found freedom
If I had wings, I'd up and go
If I had wings, Lord give me wings

(If I had wings) Oh, if I had wings
(If I had wings) Oh, Lord just give me wings
(If I had wings) If I had wings I'd make a change
If I had wings, if I had wings
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
If I had wings, if I had wings.
