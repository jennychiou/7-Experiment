You came into my life at a time when I was down
And I thought I'd never love again but I think different now
You took my hand and helped me up and I thank you for your precious love
And words cannot express the way I feel but is it real

Is it real this love that you have offered me so freely
You tell me that you love me but darling do you really
Don't make me love and lose again don't make me go through that again
I've known that hurt and I know how it feels oh is it real

Well you could mend my broken heart with love as sweet as yours
And I want to believe it's real but how can I be sure
And you could heal the hurt I've known with the love that you have shown
And all the needs you have I will fulfill but is it real

Is it real this love that you have...
Is it real
