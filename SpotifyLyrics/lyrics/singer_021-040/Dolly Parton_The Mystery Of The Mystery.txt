There are so many things that I don't understand 
And I search my mind to try to find an answer 
But the more I search the less I seem to find out why 
Like where where the wind goes, how does life begin 
What happens when we die 
The mystery of the mystery must stay unknown 
Only God can know and man must not see 
Great minds have tried but they will not find 
The answer to the mystery of the mystery 

Man will seek the mystic rails of the mystery 
But their silent halls reveal not a sound 
Many men will give their lives just to try to find 
The answer to a mystery in their mind 

The mystery of the mystery must stay unknown 
Only God can know and man must not see 
Great minds have tried but they will not find 
The answer to the mystery of the mystery
