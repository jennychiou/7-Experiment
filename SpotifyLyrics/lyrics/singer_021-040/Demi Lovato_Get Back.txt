Don't walk away like you always do
This time
Baby you're the only thing
That's been on my mind
Ever since you left
I've been a mess
(You won't answer your phone)
I'll say it once
And I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know

I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring
And I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing like we used to
Oh, kiss (or hold) me like you mean it
Like you miss me 'caus I know that you do
I wanna get back get back
With you

Don't look at me that way
I see it in your eyes
Don't worry about me I've been fine
I'm not gonna lie I've been a mess
Since you left
And every time I see you
It gets more And more intense

I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring
And I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it
Like you miss me 'caus I know that you do
I wanna get back get back
With you

You were the only one I wanted
And you were the first one I fell for
You're the only one that I'm in need of
And I don't want to be lonely anymore

I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring
And I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it
Like you miss me 'caus I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back
With you

(Get back)
Get back
(Get back)
Get back
(Get back)
Get back
(Get back)
Get back

I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring
And I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it
Like you miss me 'caus I know that you do
I wanna get back get back
With you

Get back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
