Crushed velvet drapes the walls of the room
Pillows all colors shapes and sizes on the floor
Mirrors on the ceiling reflect the candles burning low
Just close your eyes and travel anyplace you want to go
To lover's lane or far away to the mountain peaks of Spain
Crise along the Amazon where the deep blue waters flow
Our imagination will take us anyplace you want to go

Thought we can only go there in our minds
'Cause we cannot afford such luxuries so kind
The little room we live in is not much we both know
But the dreams we share can take us anyplace we want to go
Tonight we'll go to some majestic island ride the waves when the tie is rising
Lying in the silver sands where gentle breezes blow
The beauty of our love can take anyplace we want to go
To lover's lane...
Anyplace you want to go
