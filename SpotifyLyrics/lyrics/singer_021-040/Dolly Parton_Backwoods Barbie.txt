I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world
Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all

I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep

I've always been misunderstood because of how I look
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam

I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real
And I'm all dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth
And even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt

I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there
Yes, I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance
But even backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance
I'm just a backwoods Barbie just asking for a chance
