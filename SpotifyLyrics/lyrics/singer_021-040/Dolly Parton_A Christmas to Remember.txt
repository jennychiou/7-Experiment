You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes

And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and

You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember, too good to believe
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind

And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
Then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go
As our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know
Can we do this next winter
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
