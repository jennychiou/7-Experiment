Their thoughts are all mingled their dreams all confused
Their minds and their bodies how they abuse
Searching for answers that doesn't grow there
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower

Their plans their desires and all of their hopes
Wither and die as they go up in smoke
Sharp as a needle and filled with despair
Such is the curse of the wild weed flower

From a moment of joy to a lifetime of sorrow
For one day of pleasure they trade their tomorrows
Lost in a garden where bulbs all grow
With blossoms of heartaches and petals of woe

Eyes full of emptiness just stand and stare
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
