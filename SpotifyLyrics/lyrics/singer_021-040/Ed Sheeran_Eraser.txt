I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lords House, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain, that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whiskey with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror questioning what I become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key, and you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I changed the picture, perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fix, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream and that shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Old conversations with my father on the A14
Aged twelve, telling me I've got to chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
Until the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now, somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
And where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain, eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
