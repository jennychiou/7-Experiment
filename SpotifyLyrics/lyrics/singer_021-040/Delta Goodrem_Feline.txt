So they say
That you're the hunter or you're the prey
You can run away
Or you can show 'em how to be brave

It doesn't matter what you do
They'll be hunting after you
Trap you like an animal
And then everywhere you turn
There's another torch that burns
It doesn't hurt me anymore

I'm running into the fire
Falling into the flames
Turns me into the lion
I am a feline, feline
Fear the feline

I feel alive
I broke the bars that kept me caged inside
Yeah it's my time
To be the fearless queen out in the wild

I've been earning all my stripes
Standing up to every fight
You woke up the animal
And I'm never going back
I'm the leader of the pack
Got the scars of a warrior

I'm running into the fire
Falling into the flames
It turns me into the lion
I am a feline, feline
Fear the feline

Feline
Feline
Feline
Feline

I've been earning all my stripes
Standing up to every fight
You woke up the animal
And I'm never going back
I'm the leader of the pack
Got the scars of a warrior

I'm running into the fire
Falling into the flames
It turns me into the lion
I am a feline, feline
Fear the feline
