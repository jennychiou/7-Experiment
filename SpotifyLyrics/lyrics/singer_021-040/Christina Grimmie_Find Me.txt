I know something's,
Bound to change.
And I know I have,
Been to blame.

Washing away this,
Era of madness won't come,
And spread no shame.

'Cause I've been waiting,
Watching and praying,
For you to go insane.

I've been holding out,
Come on out and find me,
'Cause I've been waiting,
My turn, hey, yeah.
Pressure's on,
Now your heart is beating,
To the sound of my name,
And I say find me,
(Oh-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh).

Find me, (come on out and find me).
Find me, (oh-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh).
Find me, (pressure's on now).

Fueling the fire,
Burning the thought of,
Calling back your name.

Maybe it's all different,
Because I cease to,
Play your game.

Forget the footsteps,
Forward and take one back,
Pray that you're secure.

Hey, so now you're prying,
Open the binding, 
I'm what you're looking for.

Oh yeah!

Holding out,
Come on out and find me,
'Cause I've been waiting,
My turn, hey, yeah.
Pressure's on,
Now your heart is beating,
To the sound of my name,
And I say find me,
(Oh-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh).

Find me, (come on out and find me).
Find me, (oh-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh).
Find me, (pressure's on now).

This civil smile,
It won't get you, yeah,
Anywhere any more,
Any more, anymore!

Holding out,
Come on out and find me,
'Cause I've been waiting,
My turn, hey, yeah.
Pressure's on,
Now your heart is beating,
To the sound of my name,
And I say find me,
(Oh-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh).

Find me, (come on out and find me).
Find me, (oh-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh).
Find me, (pressure's on now).

Holding out,
Come on out and find me,
'Cause I've been waiting,
My turn, hey, yeah.
Pressure's on,
Now your heart is beating,
To the sound of my name.

Come on out and find me.
