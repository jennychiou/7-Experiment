Two doors down
They're laughing and drinking and having a party
Two doors down
They're not aware that I'm around
But here I am crying my heart out feeling sorry
But they're having a party just two doors down

I think I'll dry these useless tears
And get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join them two doors down.

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinking and having a party
Two doors down
They're all aware that I'm around
Cause here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry
Having a party just two doors down

I can't believe I'm standing here dry eyed, all smiles, and talking
Making conversation with the new love I found
I asked him if he'd like to be alone and we start walking
Down the hall to my place late
Two doors down.

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinking and having a party
Two doors down
We're not aware that they're around
Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
Having a love party two doors down
