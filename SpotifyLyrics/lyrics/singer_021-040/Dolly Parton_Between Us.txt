Let's start by stopping long enough to talk things over
Since there's a new love burning between us
With open-minded understanding between us
Let's both feel free to talk of this new love

Let there be no deep dark secrets between us
Let's never hide behind a false disguise
Let there be no hidden feelings between us
An honest love is a love that will survive

In our love let's share a friendship between us
Always close enough to talk things out
Let's be honest with ourselves and with each other
And our love will never know mistrust or doubt

Let there be no deep dark secrets
Let's never hide behind a false disguise
Let there be no hidden feelings between us
An honest love is a love that will survive
