Your love's as fresh in my memory as this morning's sunrise 
And still just as beautiful to me 
I can still feel the soft touch of love sweet and tender 
You give me love to remember 
Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering 
Each night that I spend with you 
I can still feel your soft touch, I can still feel your warm love 
You give me love to remember 

And each morning when I wake up 
Before I leave my pillow. I search through my dreams carefully 
Just to make sure that I don't leave one tiny memory 
'Cause I dream of the love I remember 

Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering 
Each night that I spend with you 
I can still feel your warm love, I can still feel your soft touch 
You give me love to remember 
Love to remember
