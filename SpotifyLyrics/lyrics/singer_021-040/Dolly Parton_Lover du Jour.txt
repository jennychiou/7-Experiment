What are you looking at, lover boy?
It won't do you any good
'Cause I know your kind
If you want to be mine
We gotta get this understood...

Oh, I'm not gonna be your be your lover du jour
Your special of the day, no way, adieu, farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in hell for you for sure
If you think I will be your be your lover du jour
Pas mol, (lover du jour) not me

I am well aware of your good looks and sexy ways
Serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste
The fresh catch of the day on your Romeo buffet
Served up hot and ready just having it your way

Well, if I'm on the menu you'd better get this straight (lover du jour)
Me 'n you had better come to terms before you grab your plate
Don't even place your order if you believe that
I am just some cheesy little dish, just another chick-ey pie

No, I'm not gonna be your be your lover du jour
The flavor of the day, no way, adieu, farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour

Oublie moi, forget me
Still lookin' lover boy?
Have you changed your view?
I told you once, I'll say it again
I'll take no merde from you... that's crap

If you want somethin' appetizin'
Somethin' real and satisfyin'
I'll be worth a second look, but that's the only way

'Cause I'm not gonna be your, be your amour du jour
Your playmate of the day, no way, adieu, farewell, bonjour
'Cause I won't be caught up in all your charm and your allure
No, I'm not gonna be your be your lover du jour

No, I'm not gonna be your be your lover du jour
The special of the day, no way, adieu, farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your be your lover du jour
Your lover du jour

Mm-mm-mm, c'est dommage, too bad

Now I am not for your amusement
I'm not a toy
You're nothin' but trouble
Oooh, you're a bad, bad boy
Well, I'm a tasty starter or I'm a full course meal
Dessert or after dinner drink and you can have your fill
Pardon my French...
Tu ne causes que des ennuis
Tue es un mauvais gar√ßon
Any questions?

Aw, my French is awful, but my love is awesome
Oooh, they're gonna laugh at me in France... sorry!
