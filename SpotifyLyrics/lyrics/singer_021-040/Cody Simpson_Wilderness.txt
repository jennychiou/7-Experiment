Have you been dreaming of the wilderness?
Have you been wondering how far it is
We will go just to show that we're the mightiest
On the globe as it rolls into oblivion

Have you been thinking 'bout the ocean too?
There's heartless hands letting the oil through
Till the blue isn't blue, will you take a stand
To the man with a plan to wash away the truth

Are you unconscious in your troubled mind?
Don't forget mountains were made to climb
To the sky, that's where you'll find crystal clementine
Looking down with a sigh, as she begins to cry
And then it rains upon the trees with their roots still in the ground
Let the water trickle down into the thirsty river mouth
The sun will shine on through every shadow of a doubt
Save us from this endless drought
