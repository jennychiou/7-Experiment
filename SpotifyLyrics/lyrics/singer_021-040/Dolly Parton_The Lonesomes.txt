My heart's as heavy as an anvil
My tears are puddled in my eyes
And time seems to be at a standstill
I've really got the lonesomes tonight
Feels like I'm never gonna make it
I'd like to lie right down and die
It's so very hard to fake it
I've really got the lonesomes tonight

Just like that old song by Hank Williams
I am so lonesome I could cry
Can't seem to shake these sad old feelin's
I've really got the lonesomes tonight
'Cause I've really got the lonesomes tonight

Ooh, I'm pretty sad

Oh, I hope tomorrow will ring truer
And I'll awake and I will be all right
But right now I couldn't feel much bluer
Can't shake these lonely memories inside

Oh, but my heart's as heavy as an anvil
And my tears are all puddled in my eyes
My mind has really got its hands full
I've really got the lonesomes tonight
You got that right
I've really got the lonesomes tonight
But I'll be all right
I've really got the lonesomes tonight
