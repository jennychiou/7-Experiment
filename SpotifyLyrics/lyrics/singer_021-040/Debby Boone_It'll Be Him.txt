If anyone ever finds a better way to love
It'll be him, loving me
If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care
It'll be him, loving me
He's every man that I've ever known rolled up in one
If I'm ever loved any more, he'll be the one
To get it done, the way it should be
It'll be him, loving me

If ever I'm down and out and need someone to love
It'll be him, loving me
When everyone else is cold and I need someone warm to hold
It'll be him, loving me
He's every man that I've ever known rolled up in one
If I'm ever loved any more, he'll be the one
To get it done, the way it should be
It'll be him, loving me
