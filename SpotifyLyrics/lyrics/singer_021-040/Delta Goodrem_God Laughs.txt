When you come from a solid foundation
It freaks you out when the ground starts shaking
And everything around you is breaking

Mum was going crazy together to keep it
Dad's two lives he was keeping it a secret
When we found out we couldn't believe it

We're all walking on quick sand
When we're busy making our plans
God laughs
Yes he does
We're all walking on quick sand
When we think that we understand
God Laughs

I've been a sound board, trying to be neutral
Born in the middle, it's hard to be useful
It's been hell if I had to be truthful

When people grow apart, people can change but
It's leaves a lot of mess that someone's gotta clean up
It happened here to the family that I love

We're all walking on quick sand
When we're busy making our plans
God laughs
Yes he does
We're all walking on quick sand
When we think that we understand
God Laughs

And we're so stupid if we think that we control
All the dark matter at the centre of this black hole
It's gonna put lives under
If we don't let go

We're all walking on quick sand
When we're busy making our plans
God laughs
Yes he does
We're all walking on quick sand
When we think that we understand
God Laughs
