Everyone needs someone they feel that they can run to
Let me be your someone the one you always come to
I wish you only happiness but that won't always be
So come to me when you're in need won't you come to me

Come to me when you're down I will help you up
When you find you need the strength that only comes from love
Let me be the one you run to in your time of need
Come to me when you're in need come to me

Come to me when you're in need and let me hide you from the world outside
Come to me when you're in need and I will dry your teardrops when you cry
Come to me let me be the one that gives you strength when you are weak
Come to me when you're in need come to me
Come to me when you're in need come to me
Won't you come to me
