I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time 
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign 
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say 
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day 
You're a gentle man 
And a gentle man is getting mighty hard to find these days 
And you're a tender man 
And you're man enough to show your love and tender ways 

I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time 
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign 
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say 
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day 

I love those silly things you do 
You make me feel once more like an innocent child of two 

I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time 
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign 
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say 
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day 

I really got the feeling got the feeling 
I really got the feeling got the feeling 
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
