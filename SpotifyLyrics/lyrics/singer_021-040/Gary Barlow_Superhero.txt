I can't sit and wait
For you to say
If there's room inside your heart
I'm not used to playin'
A silly game
So turn me down or let me start

You have to believe I'll make things right
Open your arms, give up the fight

For all that you want
For all that your feeling
There's a place where you can go
For all that you need
I will be waiting
To be your superhero

Now if you decide to run and hide
It's only if your cheating
The key's in your hand (the keys in your hand)
You must understand (you must understand)
I won't be defeated no
I really believe this goes inside
Open your arms
Let me see your right

For all that you want
For all that your feeling
There's a place where you can go
For all that you need
I will be waiting
To be your superhero
Oh
To be your superhero

I'm sure that you've heard this before so many times (so many times)
Girl look inside my heart and you will find
You'll find your superhero

I'll be the one to hold you
I'll never let you go
I know it's so good to tell you baby
To be your superhero

For all that you want
For all that your feeling
There's a place where you can go
For all that you need
I will be waiting
To be your superhero

For all that you want
For all that your feeling
There is a place where you can go
For all that you need
I will be waiting
To be your superhero
