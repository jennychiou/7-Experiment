My angel,
How'd you get to be so fly?
How'd you get to shine so bright, girl?
How'd you get to look like that?
Heaven, don't you call her back, yeah

Halo, halo, I'm not sayin' hi,
Baby, there's a ring above your head,
And it shines so bright in the sunlight, in the sunlight
Ayo, ayo, this is like a dream
Every bit of you - it makes me weak,
How did I get here?
In the sunlight, in the sun..?

I must be in heaven, 'cause I'm lookin' at an angel
Who's starin' back at me, her eyes so heavenly.
I must be in heaven, 'cause I'm lookin' at an angel
There's no one on this earth that's made this beautiful
I must be in heaven.

Angel...

Here we are, looking at the stars
I can hear, the beating of your heart,
I could listen to this song forever
You're the breeze, cruising down the coast
You're the jam, baby, I'm the toast,
It's so sweet when we're together

And if I ruled the world I'd name an island for ya,
Yeah, you can tell all your girls I named an island for you,

I must be in heaven, 'cause I'm lookin' at an angel
Who's starin' back at me, her eyes so heavenly.
I must be in heaven, 'cause I'm lookin' at an angel
There's no one on this earth that's made this beautiful
I must be in heaven.

Halo, halo, I'm not sayin' hi
Baby, there's a ring above your head,
And it shines so bright in the moonlight, in the moonlight

My angel,
How'd you get to be so fly?
How'd you get to shine so bright?
Girl, how'd you get to look like that, tell me?
Please, heaven don't you call her back.

My angel,
My angel.
