I don't want to hear a love song 
I got on this airplane just to fly 
I know there's life below me 
And all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky 
I don't want to hear a sad story filled with hearbreak and desire 
The last time I felt like this 
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire 
And I stood on the mountain in the night 
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn, I watched it burn 

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
I would hold my life in a saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, see your face 

Well you really got me this time 
And the hardest part is knowing I survive 
And I've come to listen to the sounds of trucks 
As they moved out on Highway 95 
And pretending it's the ocean coming to wash me clear 
To wash me clear if you know what I mean 

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
I would hold my life in a saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, see your face
