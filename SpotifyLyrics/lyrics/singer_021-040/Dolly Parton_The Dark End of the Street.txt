At the dark end of the street that's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
I know time's gonna take its toll we have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong oh but our love keeps a coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street you and me
They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us Lord some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
And when the daylight hours roll around and by ten we're both downtown
If we shoud meet just walk on by oh my darling now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street you and me
