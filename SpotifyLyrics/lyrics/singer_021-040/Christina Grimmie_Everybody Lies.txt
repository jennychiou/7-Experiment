Everybody lies sometimes
Nothing in the world's as it seems on the outside
Just when you think you got something real
Still, you know
Everybody lies sometimes

We all got friends, we think we can trust
Tell them all the secrets locked inside us
You wake up and find a knife in your back
Be careful what you think, it's better not to blink
We all wanna believe in the perfect person
Reality don't care about that

We always wanna cast the blame
Always waiting for the world to change
Maybe, we should start with ourselves, oh

Everybody lies sometimes
Nothing in the world's as it seems on the outside
Just when you think you got somethin' real
Still, you know
Everybody lies sometimes

We build our walls up, we close ourselves off
But do we really like, who we've become
Will we hide our hearts in a masquerade
I don't wanna look in the mirror one day
And not even recognize my own face
Why gain the world if I lose myself

We always wanna cast the blame
Always waiting for the world to change
Maybe we should start with ourselves, oh

Just stop, take a look around you
You got one shot, to get it right
Don't be afraid, to take a couple chances now
'Cause everybody lies
Ooh yeah
Yeah-yeah-eah-yeah-yeah

'Cause everybody lies sometimes (sometimes)
Nothing in the world's as it seems on the outside
Just when you think you got somethin' real (something real)
Still, you know
Everybody lies sometimes

You are an extremely unique and individual person
And I'm telling you, don't let those invalid opinions of others
Just bring you to the pits, okay?
You're strong, so own it
Love, me
