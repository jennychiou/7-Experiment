I can see it on your face it's over it's all over it's all over me and you
Love came down like the rains from heaven
Love's all over us dripping like the morning dew
We can't hide it anymore you can't hide real love
When it's all over all over me and you
And it's wonderful to know it's all over love sweet love it's all over me and you

Once we worried what folks would think if they only knew
Just how much love there was between me and you
Oh but it's no secret anymore it's all out in plain view
And love's all over us love's all over me and you
We can't hide it anymore...
