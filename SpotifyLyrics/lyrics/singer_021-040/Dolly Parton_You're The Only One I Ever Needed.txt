Every time you talk about your love
We always end up in the deepest despair
'Cause you're so afraid you won't ever have enough
Even though I say it's gonna be there

You may not be good at taking chances
But don't be afraid to win or lose
You don't know who you want to romance with
But you wouldn't be feelin' blue
If you knew what you put me through

You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for

Everywhere I look, I see you
And I do all I can to keep it that way
But even now when you're trying to believe me
A miracle of tears gets in the way

You may not be good at taking chances
But don't be afraid to win or lose
You don't who you want to romance with
But you wouldn't be feelin' blue
If you knew what you put me through

You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for

You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for

You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
