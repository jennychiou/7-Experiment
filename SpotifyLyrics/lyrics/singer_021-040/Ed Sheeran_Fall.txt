You and I
Two of a mind
This love's
One of a kind
You and I
We're drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I
Learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
We're lifted
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too? (4x)
