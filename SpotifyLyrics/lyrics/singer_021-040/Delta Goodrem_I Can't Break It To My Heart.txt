If it's okay
I'll leave the bed light on
And place your water glass where it belongs
And if it's all right
I'll lie awake at night
Pretending I am curled up at your side

See I'm circling in these patterns
Living out of memories
I'm still a long way from accepting it
That there's just no you and me

But if I still believe you love me
Maybe I'll survive
So I tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's all right
I'll still be loving you
'Cause I can't break it to my heart

Is it just me
Did I commit a crime
I won't believe that loving you
Is just a waste of time
Or was it in my head
I'm reading into things you never said

'Cause I still don't have the answers
To why we couldn't work it out

I wanna think it's something that I did
So I can turn it back around

But if I still believe you love me
Maybe I'll survive
So I tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's all right
I'll still be loving you
'Cause I can't break it to my heart

And nothing will come between us
I wanna convince myself we're perfect in
Every single way as long as I can keep
The truth away from my heart
Oh 'Cause I can't break it to my heart

'Cause I still don't have the answers
To why we couldn't work it out
I wanna think it's something that I did
So I can turn it back around

But if I still believe you love me
Maybe I'll survive
So I tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's all right
I'll still be loving you

But if I still believe you love me
Maybe I'll survive
So I tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's all right
I'll still be loving you
And if it's all right
I'll still be loving you
'Cause I can't break it to my heart
I can't break it to my heart
