"spoken:"
This is the first letter that I wrote back home to Momma and Daddy a few days after I'd moved to Nashville:

June 2,1964
Nashville, Tennessee

Dear Momma and Daddy,

I hope this letter finds everybody well and happy. As for me, I'm fine I guess. I'm just a little lonesome and a whole lot homesick. I got to Nashville okay and I thought I'd better write and let you know 'cause I knew you'd be worried about me and I don't want you to be worried about me 'cause I'm gonna be all right once I get settled and used to being away from home. I didn't realize how much I loved you and all them noisy kids until I left and I didn't realize how hard it was to leave home either till I started to leave and everybody started crying, including me. I cried almost all the way to Nashville and I wanted to turn around a few times and come back but you know how bad I've always wanted to go to Nashville and be a singer and songwriter and I believe that if I try long enough and hard enough that someday I'll make it. Don't worry about trying to sending me any money or anything 'cause I've got a job singing on the early morning television show here called the Eddie Hill Show. A couple of folks already told me that they might record a couple of my songs so I'll be making enough money to get by and I don't want you worrying about me being hungry or anything. Nashville is not exactly what I thought it was gonna be, but I believe I'm gonna like it here once I get used to it. And I don't want you worrying about me getting in trouble either 'cause I'll be good just like I promised you I would when I left. Well, can't think of anything else to say. I guess I'd better close for now. You write me real soon. Tell everybody I said hello and I'm gonna be real anxious to hear from you 'cause I sure miss you and I love you an awful lot.

With love as always,

Dolly
