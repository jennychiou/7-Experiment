And now she walk around town with her head sewn on the wrong way
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed
And if you see her, just remember
She's looking up while you're looking down, turn your whole world around for a kiss

Little miss like to put on blush, paint her lips red
Riding 'round the city looking pretty in a pink Corvette
She got her rhinestone phone, somebody on the other line
The sky's looking red but she looking fine, hey hey, she's still smiling

She got her name from a street in Brooklyn
Said her frown is just a smile turned upside down

Now she walk around town with her head sewn on the wrong way
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed
And if you see her, just remember
She's looking up while you're looking down, turn your whole world around for a kiss
Oh baby, sing it one last time, yeah

She hide her name but her daddy took it from her now
Said her frown is just a smile, twist turned upside down just like this

Little miss like to put on blush, paint her lips red, oh
Walk around town in a gown down there on the sunset
Lights are on but everybody's gone, sleeps all day, party 'til dawn
But hey hey, she's still smiling, she still smiles
