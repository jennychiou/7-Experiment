Take a seat and order the wine
I'll get the special with you on the side
Baby one taste of deserve won't hurt, oh-la-la
My apartment is an hour away
Call the taxi we can stop on the way
Back to your hotel and I won't tell, oh-la-la

Oh-la-la-la-la-la, we ain't talking about marriage
Oh-la-la-la-la-la, just give me one night in Paris
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Take me anywhere you like tonight
Just give me one night in Paris
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Just give me one night in Paris

We ain't even at the hotel yet
And I already wanna do it again
From the backseat to the bed sheets, oh-la-la
I check the clock and it's a quarter to 4
It's déjà vu feel like I've been here before
Got my lipstick on the cigarette
Une, deux, trois!

Oh-la-la-la-la-la, we ain't talking about marriage
Oh-la-la-la-la-la, just give me one night in Paris
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Take me anywhere you like tonight
Just give me one night in Paris
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Just give me one night in Paris

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't care if we don't see sunrise
You can take me anywhere you like
You can show me Paris tonight
Dans la nuit avec moi ce soir!

Oh-la-la-la-la-la, we ain't talking about marriage
Oh-la-la-la-la-la, just give me one night in Paris
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Take me anywhere you like tonight
Just give me one night in Paris
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Just give me one night in Paris.
