Bottles of Merlot
I can't stand up now
Boy, you got me feeling so weak
Your ocean is drowning me
Arms wrapped around me
Now I'm getting in too deep

Not falling 'cause I want to
Baby you keep pushing me
Don't love you 'cause I need to
But it's everything you doin' to me

Make music when you're moanin'
From night until the morning
Just tell me when you're ready
And Imma paint your body with my lips

Baby I'll do
Anything you want
Lock me down like I'm your slave
Cause ooh
When you're done with me
I can't even concentrate, concentrate
Ooh, I can't even concentrate

Drag of a cigarette
Sheets are all soakin' wet
Coldplay on the radio
You keep running through my head
Wanna do it again
We can take it nice and slow

Make music when you're moanin'
From night until the morning
Just tell me when you're ready
And Imma paint your body with my lips

Baby I'll do
Anything you want
Lock me down like I'm your slave
Cause ooh
When you're done with me
I can't even concentrate
Oh, I can't concentrate! (Yeah!)
I can't concentrate (Yeah!)
What you do to me, babe (Yeah!)

Baby I'll do
Anything you want
Lock me down like I'm your slave
Cause ooh
When you're done with me
I can't even concentrate
I can't even concentrate
I can't even concentrate
I can't even concentrate
I can't even concentrate
