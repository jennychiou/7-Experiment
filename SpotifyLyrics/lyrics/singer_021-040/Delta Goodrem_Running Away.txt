I close my eyes and make a wish for 
Inner peace and tranquillity inside 
My mind I feel it's changing 
Breaking down the defences of my heart 
It's like a new adventure 
And this is my life 
No longer know the girl inside 
The stranger in my mind 

I'm running away. Running away from you 
Though I beg you to stay. I'm running away from you 
I'm running away. From predictable 
Miss reliable. So methodical 
Wanna be individual. And original 
So radical. And desirable 

Put a message in a bottle 
Watch it sail across the ocean blue 
So free of limitations 
A vision I can only fantasize 
I'm floating in a new direction 
As this is my life 

I'm running away. Running away from you 
Though I beg you to stay. I'm running away from you 
I'm running away. From predictable 
Miss reliable. So methodical 
Wanna be individual. And original 
So radical. And desirable (x 3)

No longer know the girl inside 
The stranger in my mind
