Looking for a different space
Searching for my inner place
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind

Who is this face I see
Why is this happening to me
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind

Things are changing
So much arranging of my life
I must take hold
I'll keep on spinning until I find myself again

So I woke up and there's the moon
Seems to have risen just a little soon
But who's calling out my name anyway?

I'm disorientated
I'm trying not to be jaded
When it's all so complicated
'Cause I'm a little disorientated

Walking in a different space
Looking back just incase
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind

Love is forever
Hate was in the never
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind

Things are changing
So much arranging of my life
I must take hold
I'll keep on spinning until I find myself again

So I woke up and there's the clock
It was ticking backwards had I forgot
But what day is it anyway

I'm disorientated
I'm trying not to be jaded
When it's all so complicated
'Cause I'm a little disorientated

Things are changing
So much arranging of my life
I must take hold
I'll keep on spinning until I find myself again

So I woke up and saw the sun
Seems like my life has just begun
How 'bout I start it today anyway
