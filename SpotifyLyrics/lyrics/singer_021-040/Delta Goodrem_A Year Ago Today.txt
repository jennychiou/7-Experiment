Another year older 
A little bit stronger 
A little bit wiser than
A year ago today 

Looking over my shoulder 
I was so much younger then 
Oh I can't believe what happened 
A year ago today 

And I just can't forget about it 
It wouldn't mean a thing 
You went away 
A year ago today 

Another year gone by 
Oh the tears have run dry 
Life seemed so unkind 
A year ago today 

And I just can't understand it 
I don't think I ever will 
You went away 
A year ago today 

And how many times have I questioned myself 
What more could I do 
And how many times have I fooled myself 
Over you oh 

You've gotta pick yourself up, 
Take another look 
And dust yourself off cause life's too good, 
I'll say it to myself and I'll say it again 
Love will never end 

And though we're so far apart 
You're forever in my heart 

Another year older 
A little bit stronger 
On this anniversary 
You're watching over me 

You went away 
A year ago today 

You went away 
A year ago today
