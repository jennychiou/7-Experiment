Oh, the pain of loving you 
Oh, the misery I go through 
Never knowing what to do 
Oh, the pain of loving you 

You just can't stand to see me happy 
Seems you hurt me all you can 
Still I go on loving you 
But I never understand 

Oh, the pain of loving you 
Oh, the misery I go through 
Never knowing what to do 
Oh, the pain of loving you 

To love and hate at the same time 
The line between the two is fine 
The two have bound me heart and soul 
So strong that I can't let you go 

Oh, the pain of loving you 
Oh, the misery I go through 
Never knowing what to do 
Oh, the pain of loving you
