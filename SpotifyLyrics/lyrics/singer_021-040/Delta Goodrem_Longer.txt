I see you everyday
I guess we walk the same way
To wherever we're going
Every morning and every night
Do you smile to be polite
No way of knowing
I can't explain it
But I'm not complaining
If I'm happy or sad
If only we had

Just a minute longer. Than this
Just a little closer. Than this
I would get to know you
A little bit better
I could tell you
If only we had
Just a minute longer

A moment had arrived
It was just the right time
For conversation
And he asked me
What do you do?
What is your name?
Where are you from?
But before long
We're at the station

Oh

And I was so frustrated
In fact devastated
I feel happy but sad
If only we had

I wonder
I wonder what you think about
Do you think about me
Maybe I'm a dreamer
But I just believe
And I know what I see
Forever wishing
There would be another day
Oh if only we had
I don't care happy or sad

Just a minute longer
Just a little bit longer
A little bit
A little bit better
Just a minute longer, oh baby
Just a minute longer
Oh
Just a minute longer

I can't explain it
But I'm not complaining
If I'm happy or sad
If only we had

Owow... owowoooo
