There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left

The feeling we felt for each other
For a long time now has been dying
We'd both be better off without each other
We can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying

There's no love left...

When love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
When the warm sun goes down it turns cold
We both might as well just accept the fact
There's nothing warm left for us to hold

There's no love left...
There's no love left...
