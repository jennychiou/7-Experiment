You were not content with me when I was like I used to be
I was too old-fashioned, too simple and too plain
And so you took this country girl, taught me all about the world
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing

I used to never drink or smoke, I'd even blush at dirty jokes
I never wanted to take part in all those worldly games
But you dressed me up in sexy clothes, took me where the swingers go
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing

But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
I'm only what you made of me - your mistake was changin' me
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing

You want me like I was before, but I'm not like that anymore
This plain old simple country girl won't ever be the same
So don't expect me to go back 'cause it's a bit too late for that
An' you're the one that taught me how to swing

But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
And I'm only what you made of me - your mistake was changin' me
And, you're the one that taught me how to swing
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
Taught me how to swing
