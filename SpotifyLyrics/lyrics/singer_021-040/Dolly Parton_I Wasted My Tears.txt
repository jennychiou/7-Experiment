I wasted my tears 
When I cried over you 
I wasted my tears 
When I cried over you 
I should've known 
You would never be true 
I loved and I lost you 
Now I'm so blue 
I wasted my tears 
When I cried over you 

You said that you loved me 
And would always be true 
Now you gone'n left me 
Oh, what will I do 
Oh, why did you leave me 
For somebody new 
I wasted my tears 
When I cried over you 

I wasted my time 
When I spent it with you 
But one is so blind 
When love is so new 
Now out of my fears have come true 
I wasted my tears 
When I cried over you 

I wasted my tears 
When I cried over you
