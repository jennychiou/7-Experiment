Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine

La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play

Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame

La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play

Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am

Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
