It's been awhile, I should be moved on
'Cause I shouldn't be writing you this song
Haven't crossed my mind for so long
But tonight you're the movie, I want to leave on

Not enough rooms in this house
To hold all the treasures we found
Evidence of us all around
Your fingerprints all over who I am now

Ooh
We wished on these stars, they were ours
They remind me of you
I'm still letting you go, I just want you to know
That I think of you, think of you
Think of you, think of you

The space in the back of my mind
I meet you there to reminisce from time to time
You were the light, the blue in my skies
I saw the shades of myself in your eyes

Ooh
We wished on these stars, they were ours
They remind me of you
I'm still letting you go, I just want you to know
That I think of you, think of you
I think of you, think of you, think of you
I think of you, think of you

Ooh
We wished on these stars, they were ours
They remind me of you
I'm still letting you go, I want you to know, yeah
We wished on these stars, they were ours
They remind me of you, yeah
I'm still letting you go, I want you to know
That I think of you, think of you
I think of you, think of you
