Persevere, keep on searching
I guarantee that one day we'll be found
Who will see divine intervention
A lottery while we stand on solid ground

As the world stands in line
The bells start to chime
If your life's helpless then it's time
They knew you could run
They knew you could fight
Sharpen your arrows now

Tell me
If you found God and he gave you hope
Would you tell the world or save your soul?
If you found God, would you take Him home
Would you open the curtains or keep them closed?
If you found God, if you found God
Would it be your secret?

Try your faith and all their answers
All been quoted from the book of man
For every sin and your repentance
Can be forgiven he's the man who can

The place and the time
It's in your bloodline
Never be easy on yourself
For a king and a son
The steeple's still strong
Put down your rifle and sleep

Tell me
If you found God and he gave you hope
Would you tell the world or save your soul?
If you found God, would you take Him home
Would you open the curtains or keep them closed?
If you found God, if you found God
Would it be your secret?
If you found God, if you found God
Would it be your secret?

Could anyone really be that selfish?
Could anyone really be that cruel?
To keep the king of heaven and earth right next to you

They knew you could run
They knew you could fight
Sharpen your arrows now

Tell me
If you found God and he gave you hope
Would you tell the world or save your soul?
If you found God, would you take Him home
Would you open the curtains or keep them closed?
If you found God, if you found God
Would it be your secret?
If you found God, if you found God
Would it be your secret?

If He gave you hope, if He saved your soul
Would it be your secret?
If He gave you hope, if He saved your soul
Would it be your secret?

Keep on looking, keep on looking
Would it be your secret?
Keep on looking, keep on looking
Would it be your secret?
