Hit me like the big bang
Raining like a flash flood
Throw me like a hurricane
Now I got you in my blood

What if all I ever knew was life without you
Then I would have nothing to lose
When the ocean meets the sky
Lay shadows on the crimson tide
I'm gonna give you steady love
And love you 'til the storm subsides

And when the water fills your lungs
And your soul begins to die
I'm gonna give you steady love
I'm gonna bring you back to life

I've been to the other side
Images I've never seen
Technicolor real life
Baby, what you do to me?

What if all I ever knew was life without you
And I would have nothing to lose
When the ocean meets the sky
Lay shadows on the crimson tide
I'm gonna give you steady love
And love you 'til the storm subsides

And when the water fills your lungs
And your soul begins to die
I'm gonna give you steady love
I'm gonna bring you back to life

I'll be your lifeline
I'll be the first to jump in
There ain't no current
Strong enough to hold me back
I'll pull you up from, from the wreckage
Just know that I'm never giving up, never giving up
Oh no, ooh
Oh, yeah

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

When the ocean meets the sky
Lay shadows on the crimson tide
I'm gonna give you steady love
And love you 'til the storm subsides

And when the water fills your lungs
And your soul begins to die
I'm gonna give you steady love
I'm gonna bring you back to life
