There ain't nothing colder
Than your old cold shoulder
And it's gettin' colder
Like every kiss
You say it's not over
Over and over

But your old cold shoulder
Tells me it is

What we had
We don't know more
We can't feel it anymore
I thought a love like ours would never die

But you get colder
Every day
Every night you turned away
You couldn't say it
Any plainer
If you tried

There ain't nothing colder
Than your old cold shoulder
And it's gettin' colder
Like every kiss
You say it's not over
Over and over

But your old cold shoulder
Tells me it is
