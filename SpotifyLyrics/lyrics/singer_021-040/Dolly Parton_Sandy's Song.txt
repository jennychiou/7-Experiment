Sometimes I think of you, and tears fill my eyes 
To think of the meaning you've given my life 
You've touched me in places no one ever reached 
You've given me reason and cause to believe 
You are my rainbow; you've colored my life 
And you are my sunshine; I'm warm in your light 
You are my fountain that never runs dry 
You're my inspiration, my reason to try 

I'll love you till green grass turns lavender blue 
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew 
Till horses and chariots chase down the wind 
That's when I'll leave you, I'll love you till then 

I'll love you till green grass turns lavender blue 
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew 
Till horses and chariots chase down the wind 
That's when I'll leave you, I'll love you till then 

I'll love you till green grass turns lavender blue 
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew 
Till horses and chariots chase down the wind 
That's when I'll leave you, I'll love you till then 

That's when I'll leave you, yes 
I'll leave you then 
I'll need you till then 
I'll love you till then...
