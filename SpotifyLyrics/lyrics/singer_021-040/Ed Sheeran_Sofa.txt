She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5.01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I'm way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again

And we're both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula I
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again
And we're still so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York
That is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio
Passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want
Say the word, and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa
On the sofa, with you
