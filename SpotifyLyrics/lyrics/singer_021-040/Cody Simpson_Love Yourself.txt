"'G Love:"'
No use crying 'bout lost love
A heart gooder was back in the day
It was good all right, pretty damn good but not that good in the way
It's gone gone gone gone gone
And now I spend too much time thinking 'bout people do the things they do
Why take it personally? No way
I said where they at don't got too much to do with you at all
Models will be the first ones to walk away

"'G Love and Cody Simpson:"'
After all you is, is another dog barking in the yard
After all you is, is another empty glass sitting on the bar
After all you is, is a spinning tire on the car
You rode today, you rode tomorrow
So make a little love, take a little love
Give a little more than you get
Got to love love love yourself before you love love love somebody else
You got to love yourself, you got to love yourself, yeah

"'Cody Simpson:"'
They say don't cry 'bout spilled milk
Today's just about good enough, better than nothing
But not at all what I thought it be, I ain't meant to live this way
Take down the G's telling me what to do and what to say

"'G Love and Cody Simpson:"'
After all you is, is another dog barking in the yard
After all you is, is a fallen down house of cards
After all you is, is a thumping in my racing heart
Beat today, and beat tomorrow
So make a little love, take a little love
Give a little more than you get
Take a little love, make a little love, give a little more than you get
Make a little love, take a little love, give a little more than you get
Got to love love love yourself
Before you love love love somebody else
You got to love yourself
You got to love yourself

"'G Love and Cody Simpson:"'
Just sitting on corner, tryna go down in history
Taking it slow cause don't know better
You could travel 10 thousand miles all around the world
Tryna figure it out and end up back where you started from
And everybody always wanna know what life is all about
But you gotta live to figure it out, c'mon

"'G Love and Cody Simpson:"'
Make a little love, take a little love, give a little more than you get
Take a little love, make a little love, give a little more than you get
Make a little love, take a little love, give a little more than you get
You got to love love love yourself, love yourself
