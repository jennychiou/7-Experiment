It wasn't very long ago 
We had a love few people know 
And everything was going oh so fine 
I trusted you, you trusted me 
The way that it's supposed to be 
But love slipped from us somewhere down the line 

We had all of the good things going baby 
You know we did, everything was fine 
Enjoying the taste of the good life 
We all look for but few can find 

It's gone but we can't understand 
How luck could slip right through our hands 
All down the line things seemed so very right 
The love we shared through all these years 
We both knew that we were sincere 
Then suddenly it left just overnight 

We had all of the good things going baby 
You know we did, everything was fine 
Enjoying the taste of the good life 
We all look for but few can find 

Now that we've gone our separate ways 
I still recall those brighter days 
Days that didn't seem so very long 
Neither of us ought to blame 
We overly know that it's a shame 
And all that we had going now is gone 

We had all of the good things going baby 
You know we did, everything was fine 
Enjoying the taste of the good life 
We all look for but few can find
