We've been a searchin' for the love that lost its feelin'
That one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
We thought that love had gone never more to be returning
And the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burnin'

Oh we found it, oh we found it
Yes we found it, yeah we found it
Joy to love, joy to love, we found it

And the lights are way down low
The fire of love is high
We found it, yes we found it
Oh we found it, oh we found it
Sweet love you and I

Well I never seen a love light shine so bright no wonder we found it
Shining like a neon light with love all around it
It's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
We cried a while but now we smiled, mmm-hmm we found it

Oh we found it, oh we found it
Yes we found it, yes we found it
Joy to love, joy to love, we found it

And the lights are way down low
The fire of love is high
We found it, we have found it
Yes we found it, yes we found it
Sweet love you and I

Oh we found it, yeah we found it
Yes we found it, yeah we found it
Joy to love, joy to love, we found it

And the lights are way down low
The fire of love is high
We found it, yes we found it
Oh yes we found it, yes we found it
Sweet love you and I

Oh we found it, oh we found it
Yes we found it, oh we found it
Joy to love, joy to love, we found it
And the lights are way down low
The fire of love is high
