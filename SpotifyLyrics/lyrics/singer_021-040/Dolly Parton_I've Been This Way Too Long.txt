"'Dolly:"'
Hmm (oh ain't he cute) ah well I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No and I don't like to sweep my floor if I don't feel like sweeping
"'Both:"'
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time in tryin' 'cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long

Oh and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
Cause you can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Well I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
If you don't like the way I am...
Oh as far as I can remember back you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh that's real cute you're makin' up stuff)
