To you I may never be more than a friend 
But you'll always be special to me 
To you I may never be closer than I am 
But you'll always be special to me 
Maybe I set my sights too high to be real 
I may be wrong, but love is strong 
And I can't hide how I feel 
To you I may never be closer than I am 
But you'll always be special to me 

Maybe I set my sights too high to be real 
But love is strong, I may be wrong 
But I can't hide how I feel 
To you I may never be closer than I am 
But you'll always be special to me
