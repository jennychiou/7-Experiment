So much to say 
And just a lifetime left to say it 
How quickly time passes 

If I had my way 
I'd keep you safe within my arms 
While the storm of life crashes 

I won't always be with you, my child 
But words I can give 
When the winds of hope are dying down 
These words will live 

Above all else 
Know God's the one who'll never leave you 
Look to Him 
Above all else 

He is love you can depend upon 
A heart set to care 
If in the darkest night you should be lost 
He will be there 

I won't always be with you, my child 
But words I can give 
And when the winds of hope are dying down 
These words will live 

Above all else 
Know God is good and you can trust Him 
Look to Him 
Above all else 

He's the everlasting Father 
In His hands you'll never fall 
He's the one who holds it all 
Above all else 

He's the author of your laughter 
He's the keeper of your tears 
He's the one who you must fear 
Above all else 

He's the giver of the kingdom 
Bought for you right from the start 
And He'll ask you for your heart 
Above all else 

So much to say 
And not enough time left to say it 
Just love the Lord 
Above all else
