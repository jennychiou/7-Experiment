You can make this country girl 
Feel just like a queen 
And this two-room frame with you inside 
Is such a gorgeous thing 
40 acres of Georgia clay 
Seems just like Montego Bay 
And December turns into May 
When you love me 

This cotton gown feels soft as lace 
When I'm lying by your side 
And the rain against this old tin roof 
Sounds like the ocean tide 
Mama's torn and tattered quilt 
On this old homemade bed you built 
To me it feels smooth as silk 
When you love me 

No I'm not dreaming 
It's just how I feel 
I've never felt something 
I know is so real 

That broken down old pickup truck 
Is like a limousine to us 
You change my world with just your touch 
When you love me
