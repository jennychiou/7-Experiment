Sing a song sweet music man 
'Cause I won't be there to hold your hand like I used to 
I'm through with you 
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man 
But you surround yourself with people 
Who demand so little of you 
You touched my soul with your beautiful song 
You even had me singin' along right with you 
You said I need you 
Then you changed the words and added harmony 
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new 

Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do 
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along 
Nobody else can make me feel things are right 
When I know they're wrong 
Nobody sings a love song quite like you 

Sing your song sweet music man 
Travel the world with a six piece band 
That does for you what you tell 'em to 
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung 
To so many people who've all begun came back on you 

Sing your song sad music man 
Makin' your living doing one-night stands 
They're through with you 
They don't need you 
You're still a heck of a singer but a broken man 
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to 
Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do 
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along 
And nobody else can make me feel things are right 
When they're wrong with a song 
Nobody sings a love song quite like you 

Sing your song sweet music man 
I believe in you
