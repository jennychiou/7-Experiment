Did I hear you say you're leaving
After all the years is this goodbye
Do you just leave today
Taking all my tomorrows away
What becomes of my world
When you leave me

Once I heard you say forever
I just can't believe this is the end
Did your heart change its mind
Are you leaving forever behind
What becomes of my world
When you leave me

Where can I go
What will I do
There was no me
Before there was you

Yes I heard you say you're leaving
Nothing I can do will make you stay
You're not mine anymore
But one thing as you walk out that door

What becomes of my world
When you leave me
What becomes of my world
When you leave me
