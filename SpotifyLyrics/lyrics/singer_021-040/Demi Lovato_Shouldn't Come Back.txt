See you calling again
I don't wanna pick up, no-oh
I've been laying in bed
Probably thinking too much oh-oh
Sorry, I'm not sorry for the times I don't reply
You know the reason why

Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
Tired of being so sad
Tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop, right now
You'll only let me down, oh-oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me

Trying hard to forget
Should be easier than this oh-oh
And all the birthdays you missed
I was only a kid oh-oh
Sorry, I'm not sorry for the times I don't reply
You know the reason why

Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
Tired of being so sad
Tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop, right now
You'll only let me down, oh-oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
To me

Sorry, I'm not sorry for the times

Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
Tired of being so sad
Tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop, right now
You'll only let me down, oh-oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me

Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
