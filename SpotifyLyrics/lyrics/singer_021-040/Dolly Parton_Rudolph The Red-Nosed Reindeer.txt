Hey kids now I know you all know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
(Rudolph) that's right Rudolph
He was the one with the big red nose that everyone make fun of
Everyone there is except Santa

Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it why you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They'd never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Until one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
Hey Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history

Then one foggy Christmas Eve...
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer...
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history
