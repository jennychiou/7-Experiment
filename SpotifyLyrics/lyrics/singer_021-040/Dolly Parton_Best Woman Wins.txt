Who do you think you are 
What do you think this is 
A game you can play 
Tryin' to steal him away 
Well, I don't need a heartache like this 
Well, don't think I don't go through hell 
But heaven is what we both want 
He's easy to love, but he's hard to give up 
And if you think I will, well, you're wrong 

The best woman wins 
I will fight 'til the end 
I'll lay down and die if I must 
I'll beg and I'll plead 
I will suffer and bleed 
But he must make a choice between us 

This soap opera play that we're in 
Is just like you watch on TV 
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it; 
Starring you, him and me 

In love as in war all is fair 
So a fight to the finish begins 
When you fight from desire 
You fight fire with fire 
So may the best woman win 

The best woman wins 
I will fight 'til the end 
I'll lay down and die if I must 
I'll beg and I'll plead 
I will suffer and bleed 
But he must make a choice between us 

So may the best woman win
