Yeah
When I look at you
It's like a getaway
I could feel the sun
It's shinin' on my face
If I'm dreaming here
Don't let me wake
'Cause I'm in paradise

Every time we kiss
It's like a crashing wave
I could feel the rush
What a sweet escape
I'm divin' in
To your embrace
'Cause I'm in paradise

When I lie with you
It's like we're innocent
Staring at the blue sky, baby (baby)
I don't want this time
To ever end
'Cause I'm in paradise

Baby, let me tell you something
You and I are really something
I just wanna ask you
Can you feel it?
As long as the sun is shinin'
I know you're the light behind me
Brighter and brighter and brighter baby

(Come on)

When I see your smile
It's like a summer breeze
Blowin' me away
From reality
If I'm dreaming here
Just let me be
'Cause I'm in paradise

In paradise yeah yeah
In paradise

You should let me be
You should let me be
Paradise
