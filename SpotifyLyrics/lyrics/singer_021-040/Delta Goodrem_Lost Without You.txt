I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes
(You might say) A little righteous and too proud
I just want to find a way to compromise
'Cause I believe that we can work things out

I thought I had all the answers
Never giving in
But baby since you've gone
I admit that I was wrong

All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you
I need you by my side
If we ever said we'd never be together
And we ended with goodbye
Don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without you

I keep trying to find my way
But all I know
Is I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
Lost without you

How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues?
Baby I'm so lonely all the time
Everywhere I go I get so confused
You're the only thing that's on my mind

Oh my bed's so cold at night
And I miss you more each day
Only you can make it right
Though I'm not too proud to say

All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you
I need you by my side
If we ever said we'd never be together
And we ended with goodbye
Don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without you

I keep trying to find my way
But all I know is
I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
I'm lost without you

If I could only hold you now
Make the pain just go away
Can't stop the tears from running down my face
(Oh)

All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you
I need you by my side
If we ever said we'd never be together
And we ended with goodbye
I don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without you

I keep trying to find my way (yeah)
But all I know is
I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
(But all I find is) I'm lost without your love

I keep trying to find my way
And all I know is
I'm lost without you (oh)

I'm lost without you
