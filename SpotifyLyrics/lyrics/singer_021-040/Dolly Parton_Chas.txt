Chas I cook you're a breakfast and send you to work
I mend your clothes Chas I iron your shirts
There's so much thought in each thing that I do
And all of the time Chas I'm loving you
And I greet you each evening Chas when you come home
I miss you so badly while you are gone
And if I make you happy then I'm happy too and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
Chas I rock your babies I teach them to talk
I care for your wife Chas because she can't walk
I do all the things she's unabled to do and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I want you so much but your wife need you Chas
You'll never be mine and I'll never ask
I know that you love her and I love her too but all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I look at you Chas you look at me but what I am thinking must never be
I love you so much and it's hard to resist
I want you but I I couldn't take you from sis
But all of the time Chas I'm loving you
