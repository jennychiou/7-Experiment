Told you I'm moving out to bigger and better things
Guess you never know what good you got until it's gone
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place
The list goes on and on and on

There was Nicky, Nicole, Tiffany and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world
But you say that I change like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messing with these LA girls

(I miss my baby, I miss my baby) LA girls
(I miss my baby) Messing with these LA girls

Boy, I miss the days we'd take a Greyhound in NYC
Wish I could've seen that it was perfect how it was
Listen, I don't want this to be the way you remember me
'Cause I know I was wrong, wrong

There was Nicky, Nicole, Tiffany and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world (only you my world)
But you say that I change like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messing with these LA girls

(I miss my baby) My baby
(I miss my baby) LA girls
(I miss my baby) Here we go, messing with these LA girls
(I miss my baby) Baby
(I miss my baby) LA girls
(I miss my baby) Here we go, messing with these LA girls

One, two, three, talk to me like
A-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, quit messing with me baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

There was Nicky, Nicole, Tiffany and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world (only you my world)
But you say that I change like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messing with these LA girls

(I miss my baby, baby)
(I miss my baby) LA girls
(I miss my baby, baby) Messing with these LA girls
I'm missing my baby
(I miss my baby) Baby
(I miss my baby) LA girls
(I miss my baby, baby) Messing with these LA girls

(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) I miss my baby
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I miss my baby, LA girls
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) I miss my baby
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Oh, oh, these LA girls
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) I miss my baby
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I miss my baby, LA girls
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) I miss my baby
Messing with these LA girls
