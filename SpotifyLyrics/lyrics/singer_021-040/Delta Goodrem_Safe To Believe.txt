She found a secret hiding behind 
A closed door
No strength to believe it 
Like a flame that can't burn anymore
A heart gripped with sadness, 
A fear that was hard to let go
Then she found an angel
A love that she'd never known

So lay with me
I've been so scared to breathe
You make it safe to believe in all that I am
And take my hand, love me for who I am
Teach me to dream again, it's all that I need
You make it safe to believe

She had forgotten the beauty 
She lived in her dreams
Her heart had stopped hoping broken
By what she had seen
Then a chance constellation a lighthouse
As bright as the sun
Oh two hearts resonating
Two lives now living as one

Lay with me
I've been so scared to breathe
You make it safe to believe in all that I am
And take my hand, love me for who I am
Teach me to dream again, it's all that I need
You make it safe...

In the darkest times of your life
There's a spirit that hears your cry...

Lay with me
I've been so scared to breathe
You make it safe to believe in all that I am

Lay with me
I've been so scared to breathe
You make it safe to believe in all that I am
And take my hand, love me for who I am
Dream again, it's all that I need
You make it safe to believe

You make it safe to believe
