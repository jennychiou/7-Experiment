Well this big city life is gettin' me down 
There's just too many people around 
There's dirt in the air and crime in the street 
High-rise buildings and cold concrete 
This rat race sure enough takes a toll 
I wanna run off to my fishin' hole 
Take me back take me back 
Take me back to the country 
Take me back take me back 
Take me back to the country 

Where the stars at night 
Outshine those city lights 
Take me back to the country 
Where the eagles fly 
And the treetops touch the sky 
Take me back to the country 

This traffic jam is makin' me mad 
I miss the simple life I had 
Peace and quite runnin' free 

I wanna go home to my family 
I'm sick of the clock, sick of the phone 
Out in the country my time's my own 
Take me back take me back 
Take me back to the country 
Take me back take me back 
Take me back to the country 

Where the stars at night 
Outshine those city lights 
Take me back to the country 
Where the eagles fly 
And the treetops touch the sky 
Take me back to the country 

Where the stars at night 
Outshine those city lights 
Take me back to the country 
Where the eagles fly 
And the treetops touch the sky 
Take me back to the country 
Take me back to the country
