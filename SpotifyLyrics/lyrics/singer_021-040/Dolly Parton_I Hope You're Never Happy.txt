I wish you all the luck I wish you only the best
Satisfaction in love, and true happiness
I wish you blue skies and rainbows, I wish you joy pure and sweet
I wish you all that you wish for, but only if you're with me

I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me

I have had you too long, I have given too much
I have loved you too strong to think of giving you up
I've always envied those lovers that wish you well when you leave
And wish you luck with another; but there are others like me

I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
And every face you look into, I hope you're haunted by me
Yes, I'm possessive and jealous; at least I speak honestly
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me

I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy, never ever ever happy
Never ever ever happy
With anybody but me

I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me

I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
