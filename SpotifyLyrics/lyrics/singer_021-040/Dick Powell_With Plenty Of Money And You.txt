I have never envied folks with money.
Millionaires don't get along so well.
I have you but haven't any money.
Still the combination would be swell.
Oh, baby what I wouldn't do
With plenty of money and you!
In spite of the worry that money brings,
Just a little filthy lucre brings a lot of things.
And I could take you to places you'd like to go
But outside of that I've no use for dough.
It's the root of all evil, of strife and upheaval,
But I'm certain honey
That life could be sunny
With plenty of money and you.

Oh baby what I couldn't do 
With plenty of money and you.
In spite of the worry that money brings
Just a little filthy lucre buys a lot of things.
And I could take you to places you'd like to go
But outside of that I've no use for dough.
It's the root of all evil, of strife and upheaval
But I'm certain honey, 
That life could be sunny 
With plenty of money and you.
