As night falls around us
Love's tender embrace replaces
The sun's golden light
Then love shows us beauty
That only love can describe
Love, you're so beautiful tonight

As you fill our hearts
With tenderness and emotions inside
Lost in each other
With the world closed outside
Oh this must be like heaven
Well, it's heaven to you and I
Love, you're so beautiful tonight

Your nearness in silence
Your rapid heartbeat
Your face touching mine
Then you whisper on my cheek
I'll love you 'til the stars
In the heavens lose their light
Oh love, you're so beautiful tonight

As you fill our hearts
With tenderness and emotions inside
Lost in each other
With the world closed outside
And this must be like heaven
It's heaven to you and I
Love, you're so beautiful tonight

I'll love you 'til the stars
In the heavens lose their light
Love, you're so beautiful tonight
