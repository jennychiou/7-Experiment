Ooh, ooh, la-ah.

Coming home, the locks broken,
And the door's wide open,
It's all gone, it's all gone now.

I look around, it's just white walls,
Listen now to echoes,
It's all gone, it's all gone now.

Ever since you broke into me,
Ever since you left with the key,
I can't open up for,
Anyone anymore, anymore.

You took the sun, the moon, and the stars.
Now we're walking all alone in the dark.
You stole my heart,
You stole my heart,
Give it back to me.

All the love that we made here is gone.
I'm living in an empty house of cards.
You stole my heart,
You stole my heart,
Give it back to me.

King of thieves,
The king of thieves,
You're the king of thieves,
The king of, the king of.

Inside, I'm hollow,
'Cause you carved my heart out,
It's all gone, it's all gone now.

'Cause you dealt a cold hand,
I'm stripped into nothing,
Take it all, take it all, yeah.

'Cause ever since you broke into me,
Ever since you left with the key,
I can't open up for,
Anyone anymore, anymore.

You took the sun, the moon, and the stars.
Now we're walking all alone in the dark.
You stole my heart,
You stole my heart,
Give it back to me.

All the love that we made here is gone.
I'm living in an empty house of cards.
You stole my heart,
You stole my heart,
Give it back to me.

King of thieves,
The king of thieves,
You're the king of thieves,
The king of, the king of.

I'll play the victim,
'Cause you planned it out
Like cops and robbers,
Just surrender now.

You took the sun, the moon, and the stars.
Now we're walking all alone in the dark.
You stole my heart,
You stole my heart,
Give it back to me.

All the love that we made here is gone.
I'm living in an empty house of cards.
You stole my heart,
You stole my heart,
Give it back to me.

King of thieves,
The king of thieves,
You're the king of thieves,
The king of, the king of.

Oh, eh-oh, eh-oh,
Oh, eh-oh, eh-oh,
Oh, eh-oh, eh-oh.
