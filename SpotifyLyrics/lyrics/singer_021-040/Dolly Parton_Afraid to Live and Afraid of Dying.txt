They say most anything you eat could hurt your health 
Be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself 
And pollution in the air might make you sick 
Makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick 

Do the men that quote this danger really know 
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so 
The biggest danger sign that we should know 
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go 

We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin' 
And afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin' 
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave 
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin' 

Do the men that quote this danger really know? 
Life is gift to be enjoyed, why worry so? 
The biggest danger sign that we should know 
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go 
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
