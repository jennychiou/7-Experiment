You'd be surprised I'm doing so well
Since I lost you I'm finding myself
Trying the old things now seems so new
It's amazing what freedom can do

I'm free to sit alone every night
Cry if I want till the morning light
No one to make my heartache end
I'm free to be lonely again

Don't get me wrong the chains weren't so bad
Now and then I wish I had them back
But I really don't have time to think of you
Doing all the things I'm finally free to do

I'm free to sit alone every night
Cry if I want till the morning light
No one to make my heartache end
I'm free to be lonely again

I'm free to sit alone every night
Cry if I want till the morning light
No one to make my heartache end
I'm free to be lonely again
