Late at night
When it's dark
And the world's asleep
From the bottom
Of my heart

You're the one and only
Face in my mind that I see
Think I'm fallin'
Fallin' hard
Had me right from the start

And your smile
Takes me up
I've been walking
In the moon
Like an astronaut, yeah

If you sent me flyin'
Up in the sky
Imagine what happens
When two stars collide

So out of this world
So out of this earth
But tell me first
Wonder if
Does she even notice me?

Sometimes I dream
How I think It'll be
She'd just crash into,
Crash into me, Crash into
Crash into me
Crash into,
Crash into me... (Oh girl)

Yeah...

At the speed of light
You can run into my love
I would catch you
Girl in my arms

So don't worry baby
With me you're safe
From harm, yeah

If you sent me flyin'
Up in the sky
Imagine what happens

When two stars collide

So out of this world
So out of this earth
But tell me first
Wonder if
Does she even notice me?

Sometimes I dream
How I think It'll be
She'd just crash into,
Crash into me, Crash into
Crash into me
Crash into,
Crash into me... (Oh girl)

Back up!

Crash, crash baby
Crash into me
No if's or maybe's
Ain't nothing to it
Just crash crash baby

Take a chance with me
Let's get crazy
Crash, crash
Just crash into me

Girl, as hard as you can
Just like it'll never end
Girl send me flyin'
No I ain't comin' back again

I can't imagine this
Can you imagine this?
Come on just crash into me
Wonder if
Does she even notice me?

Sometimes I dream
How I think It'll be
She'd just crash into,
Crash into me, Crash into
Crash into me
Crash into,
Crash into me... (Oh girl)

Yeah
