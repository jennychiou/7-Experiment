There's a wreath on the door she don't live here no more
As of today she flew home
And we all gathered here in sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill that's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole family tree is shedding its leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again

Oh she's an angel let her fly let her fly
She's gone home to glory to her home in the sky
When God sees her coming heaven's choir will smile
And say oh she's an angel let her fly let her fly
Oh she's an angel let her fly

She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing Rock of Ages and In the Sweet By and By
Her life wasn't easy oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel Lord so let her fly

Oh she's an angel let her fly let her fly...
Ooh she's an angel let her fly
