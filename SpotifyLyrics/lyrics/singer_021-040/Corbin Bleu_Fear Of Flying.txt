Some things last till the end of time
But what we had just couldn't survive
I got so used to you in my life
So now that you're gone there's something missing inside

How can you expect me to just move on?
When you're what I lived for, you're all I know
Got so used to having you to lean on
Without you I'm left with

The fear of flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, I just can't do it on my own

The fear of flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, I just can't do it on my own

If time should heal the pain and the hurt
Then why do I feel like it's getting worse?
Since you disappeared I finally learned
That my biggest fear came to life when I lost you girl

How can you expect me to just move on?
When you're what I lived for, you're all I know
Got so used to having you to lean on
Without you I'm left with

The fear of flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, I just can't do it on my own

The fear of flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, I just can't do it on my own

Now that I'm standing here at the edge
If I trip, then I'm falling without you my friend
I don't think you'll ever know how much
You meant to me, why did our love have to end?

How can you expect me to just move on?
When you're what I lived for, you're all I know
Got so used to having you to lean on
Without you I'm left with

The fear of flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, I just can't do it on my own

The fear of flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, can't do it on my own
Flying, I just can't do it on my own
