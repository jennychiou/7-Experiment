I can hear the rippling water falling gently
From the waterfall that I have found
From the meadow I hear meadowlarks a singing
Seems there's sounds of nature all around

I can hear the wind go whistling through the treetops
I hear raindrops falling softly to the ground
In the distance I can hear the roar of thunder
Seems there's sounds of nature all around

Sounds of nature fill the air with music
How I love and cherish every sound
I often kneel in prayer to thank the Master
For the sounds of nature all around

In a barren tree a lonesome dove is calling
For its mate that's nowhere to be found
In the garden I hear honeybees a humming

Sounds of nature fill the air with music...
Seems there's sounds of nature all around
