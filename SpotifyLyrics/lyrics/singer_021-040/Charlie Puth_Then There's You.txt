Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed
Some girls be craving that attention to be seen
But the one I'm looking at is right in front of me

There's no words to express
When you're wearing that dress that way
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say

There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you

Some girls, they hit me up saying, "What you doing now?"
But they don't really understand the masterpiece I've found
Those girls be wondering why I haven't been around
And if they haven't figured out, I bet they hear me

There's no words to express
When you're wearing that dress that way
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say

There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you

Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed

There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
Did you know you're beautiful, baby?
There's beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
