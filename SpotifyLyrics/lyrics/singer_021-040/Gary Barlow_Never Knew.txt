Oh yeah

I found the road to nowhere
The greener grass it turned to stone
Your shadowed face shines a rainbow now
The sign I found did point it home

Never knew that I'd miss you this way
Never knew that pain could survive here inside
Never knew that I'd miss you this much
I'm reaching out to touch
I'm calling out for love

I only walked to breathe again
I felt the walls were falling down on me
Caught a busy train to freedom
Now here I stand in this lonely town

Never knew that I'd miss you this way
I never knew that pain could survive here inside
Never knew that I'd miss you this much
I'm reaching out to touch
I'm calling out for love

And when stars fill the sky
It takes me back to the time
When we live for only love

Never knew that I'd miss you this way

Never knew that I'd miss you this way
I never knew that pain could survive here inside
Never knew that I'd miss you this much
And I'm reaching out to touch
And I'm calling baby calling
Oh... for your love

Oh never knew
