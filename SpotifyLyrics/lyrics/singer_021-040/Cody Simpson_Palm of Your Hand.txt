Like hiding gemstones in the warm sand, we all wish to drift away
Silver sunshine in my cold hands, the moon's a mirror on my day
Willow trees under the gold sky, and California shows her age
A picture in my pocket from a long lost lover to keep with me on my way

The more you wonder, the more you learn
The more you love, the less you'll hurt
No matter what you do or where you stand
The world is in the palm of your hand, the palm of your hand

Plant the seed and let the flower grow
Stop stealing diamonds 'cause they're, they're just a stone
The world will give us all an equal chance
It's all in the palm of your hand

The more you wonder, the more you learn
The more you love, the less you'll hurt
No matter what you do or where you stand
The world is in the palm of your hand, the palm of your hand
