Can we love until there's nothing left
And we're collecting dust (dust)
Use the hell of our golden souls
Until we're flecks of rust (rust)

A love so deep
Nothin' else like it
Scars go deep
But they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark (dark)

Cross my heart
That I'd die for ya
Cross my heart
That I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bittersweet tattoo (tattoo)

And we go oh you're my kingdom come
Oh you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne

Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Let it intertwine your hand in mine
And fill the empty space (space)
All the demons cry cause you and I found love in a broken place (place)

A love so deep
Nothin' else like it
Scars go deep
But they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark (dark)

Cross my heart
That I'd die for ya
Cross my heart
That I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bittersweet tattoo (tattoo)

And we go oh you're my kingdom come
Oh you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah,

Gather round, now I'm back from my holiday
"Long live the Queen" what the people say
And that be me, I gotta king in my calvary
Them other knights say goodnight
They get apathy
You'll never catch an Adam without Eve
You'll never catch a Blue without Steve
See what I mean? You're my Caesar
Burn my chariot
You know family matters, what's Carl without Harriet?
Inseparable like Mary Kate and Ashley
Incredible I'm ready if you ask me, to ride on them
Them meaning chicks ya feel me
I break 'em down it's a sport I should win an Espy
Royalty another level boy your throne shine
Legendary love, the nation needs a paradigm
Call all the king's horses and all the king's men
We're ruling till the end (kingdom come)

And we go oh you're my kingdom come
Oh you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne

Yeah

You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah
You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
