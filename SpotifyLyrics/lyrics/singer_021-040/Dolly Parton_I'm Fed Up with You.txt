I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
You say that wasn't you I saw with someone else last night
You say you've never done me wrong you've always treated me right
I know it was dark but not that dark and I'm not that blind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you and the way that you do
I used to love you now I change my mind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I once believed everything you've said I was so in love with you
You said I was the only one now I know that wasn't true
Now I know just where I stand I'm tidin' your cheatin' line
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you...
I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
