You think you're so great 
With your style and obvious charm 
As you casually glance my way 
Then take somebody else's arm 
Then the music leads you away 
And you begin to shine 

Come on, meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
When you hold me, don't let go 
Spin me around 
Take the blind and lead tonight 
And won't touch down 
Anywhere where we are 
We know heaven can't be very far 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
The stars are coming out tonight 

I was noticing the arrogant way that you move when you want to get through 
Like the choice was already made before we all knew 
Then the music leads you away 
And you begin to shine 

Come on, meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
When you hold me, don't let go 
Spin me around 
Take the blind and lead tonight 
And won't touch down 
Anywhere where we are 
We know heaven can't be very far 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
The stars are coming out tonight 

When you hold me, don't let go 
Spin me around 
Take the blind and lead tonight 
And won't touch down 
Anywhere where we are 
We know heaven can't be very far 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 
Meet me on the dance floor 

Dance floor 

When you hold me, don't let go 
Spin me around 
Take the blind and lead tonight 
And won't touch down 
When you hold me, don't let go 
Spin me around 
Take the blind and lead tonight 
And won't touch down
