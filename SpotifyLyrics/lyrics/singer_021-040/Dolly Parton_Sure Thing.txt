It's Saturday night and it's a perfect night for dancin' 
I've had my makeup off and on all day 
But it's gotta be right for a night of sweet romancing 
And I've combed my hair at least a thousand ways 
Mirror Mirror don't you tell a soul 
Of how I smiled and talked all day to you 
And how I practiced every step I know of 
But tonight's the night and I'm a dancing fool 

(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin' 
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor 
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin' 
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more 

I could of had a date but I thought I'd take my chances 
I'm gonna dance with a different guy to every song 
Then I'm a gonna wait till the right one strikes my fancy 
The he's gonna be the one to dance me home 

(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin' 
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor 
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin' 
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more 

(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin' 
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor 
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin' 
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more
