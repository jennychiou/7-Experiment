A little white house with black wooden shadows
A porch with its columns all covered with vine
My broken dream house where he lives with another
But this was supposed to be mine

Two little children that look like their daddy
With the same smile and the same eyes that shine
The only thing wrong I'm not their mommy
But they were supposed to be mine

He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me

He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me

And he is supposed to be mine
