Mama, it's so good to be back home again 
I'm so proud to see that you are looking well 
Yes, I know that I look a little weary 
Oh, but Mama, I have been through living hell 
You know how much I've always loved him, Mama 
But he done things to me I couldn't understand 
Why, he made me watch him love another woman 
And he tried to make me love another man 

Mama, can I be your little girl again? 
I need you now even more than I did then 
And I need a lot of love and understanding 
And a lot of time to get me over him 

If I lose my mind, Mama, I wanna be here with you 
Have them lock me up and see I have good care 
But I just couldn't stand his torture any longer 
I was afraid of what I'd do if I stayed there
