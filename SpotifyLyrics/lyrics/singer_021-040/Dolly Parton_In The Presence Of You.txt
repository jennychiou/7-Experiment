In the presence of you I wonder
Why I can't say the things that I want to
All the pretty words that I planned to say when I'm with you 
I lose them in the presence of you

Your nearness makes my voice tremble
There's a weakness that I feel through and through
Searching for words to describe how I love you
Don't come easy in the presence of you

Love and admiration might make my words silent
But feelings say more than words do
And the feeling of loving you is all around me
Anytime I'm in the presence of you

Love and admiration might make my words silent...
