Woo ooh
Yeah ah

My head's full of thought
Thoughts of you
And I'm distracted so easy
Thinking what to do
So unsure, so unfamiliar
Am I wrong to think that something could happen

Will you fall for me
I need to know, the way I'd like you to
Baby, will you fall for me
The way I've fallen for you

I'm not like myself
And I'm playing the role of someone else
And my hearts beating so fast
I can't stop it
And I'm so unsure
So unfamiliar
Am I wrong to think that something could happen

Will you fall for me
The way I'd like you to
Will you fall for me
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for

Fallen for, fallen for you

For you

So unsure, so unfamiliar
Am I wrong to think,
That something could happen
Was I wrong to think I

Will you fall for me
The way I'd like you to
Will you fall for me
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for you
