All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
All my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
Not running away

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
All my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
