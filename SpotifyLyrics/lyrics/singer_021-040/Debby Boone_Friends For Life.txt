Thoughts of the soul 
Shared with compassion 
Everlasting trust in a 
Common goal 
Always forgiving 
Ever building 
True friends for life 

Loyalty 
Hearts in communion 
Mutual union built on a 
Sympathy 
Growing together 
Through whatever 
True friends for life 

As sorrow demands that someone would care 
So joy commands that its joy be should be shared 
Iron sharpens iron to strength in the end, and so 
Faith and good are the wounds of a 
Friend for life 
A patient and caring 
Sanctuary 
Formed as we're 
Sharing strife 
Always protecting 
Not neglecting 
True friends for life 

As water reflects the face of a man 
So a man's heart can be shown by his friend 
And if I am molded by what I love, it's you 
You've taught me lovingly how to be 

Friends for life 
Encouraged to be 
What we should be 
Committed to 
Make things right 
Sacred companion 
Take my hand 
We'll be friends for life
