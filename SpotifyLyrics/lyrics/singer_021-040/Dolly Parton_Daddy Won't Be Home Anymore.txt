As I look around the little house we were so happy in 
I think of all the happy times we'll never see again 
Then I break down and start to cry, the children ask what for 
I can't find a way to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore 
Each night before they go to sleep they fold their little hands 
And say a prayer for Daddy fighting in their far-off land 
So tonight I'll help them say their prayers like I've always done before 
God give me courage to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore 

But honey as for me there'll never be another man 
And I'll bring our children up the best way that I can 
You died for what you thought was right that much I know for sure 
But the children just can't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore 

No the children just don't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore
