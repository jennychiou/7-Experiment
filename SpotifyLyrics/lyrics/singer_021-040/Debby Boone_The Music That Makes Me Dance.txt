I know he's around
When the sky and the ground started ringing
I know that he's near
By the thunder I hear in advance

His words, his words alone are the words
That can start my heart singing
And his is the only music that makes me dance

He'll sleep and he'll rise
In the light of two eyes that adore him
Bore him it might
But he won't leave my sight for a glance

In every way, everyday I need less of myself
I need more him, more him
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance

Bore him it might
But he won't leave my sight for a glance

In every way, everyday I need less of myself
And I need more him, more him
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance
Yes, his is the only music that makes me dance
