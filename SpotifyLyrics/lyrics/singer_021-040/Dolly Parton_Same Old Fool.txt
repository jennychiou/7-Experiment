There I was, the girl that you love to hate but hate to love
Alone I guess, you might say yes I was
And there you were giving me love enough for any girl
To understand but this girl couldn't see

I was still the same old me
Caught in my fantasy
Same old fool with the same old dream
Still the same old me
You showed me how life can be
Now the same old fool
Has got a brand new dream

One more chance is all that I'll ever need
'Cause you gave to me a shred of hope more than most receive
And here I am now that I finally, finally, finally found what real love means
This brand new dream won't end

I was still the same old me
Caught in my fantasy
Same old fool with the same old dream
Still the same old me
You showed me how life can be
Now the same old fool
Has got a brand new dream

I was still the same old me
Caught in my fantasy
Same old fool with the same old dream
Still the same old me
You showed me how life can be
Now the same old fool
Has got a brand new dream

I was still the same old me
Caught in my fantasy
Same old fool with the same old dream
Still the same old me
You showed me how life can be
Now the same old fool
Has got a brand new dream
