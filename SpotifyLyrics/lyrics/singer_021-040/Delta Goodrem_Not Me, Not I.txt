You mixed me up for someone 
Who'd fall apart without you 
Yeah you broke my heart for the first time 
But I'll get over that too 
It's hard to find the reasons 
Who can see the rhyme? 
I guess that we where seasons out of time 
I guess you didn't know me 

If you think love is blind 
That I wouldn't see the flaws between the lines 
Surprised that I caught you out 
On every single time that you lied 
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry 
No not me, not I, not I, no not me, not I 

The story goes on without you 
And there's got to be another ending 
But yeah you broke my heart it won't be the last time 
But I'll get over them too 
As a new door opens we close the ones behind 
And if you search your soul I know you'll find 
You never really knew me 

If you think love is blind 
That I wouldn't see the flaws between the lines 
Surprised that I caught you out 
On every single time that you lied 
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry 
No not me, not I, not I, not I, not I 

All you said to me 
All you promised me 
All the mystery never did believe 
No I never cry no I never not me not I 

If you think love is blind 
That I wouldn't see the flaws between the lines 
Surprised that I caught you out 
On every single time that you lied 
Did you think that every time I see you I would cry No not I, I won't cry 
No not me, not I, not I
