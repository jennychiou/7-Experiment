I've got a question on my mind
You can answer in your time
Just don't freeze like a deer in the headlight
Sometimes it's the risk of getting hurt
That's beautiful, and worse
Is being numb and feeling nothing at all

A little pain let's you know you're alive
You've gotta live in love not just survive

Hearts that don't love can't be broken
A dream stays a dream if not woken
If you never bleed then you won't understand
Come pick me red roses with your bare hands

I'm standing right in front of you
But you don't know what to do
It's the fear of thorns keeps you out of the garden
Be brave - be the fool you've never been
'Cause I'll be here to kiss your skin
Meet me on the path where love could begin

Hearts that don't love can't be broken
A dream stays a dream if not woken
If you never bleed then you won't understand
Come pick me red roses with your bare hands

Make me feel I'm worth it

Don't love me with gloves on
Pick me roses with your bare hands
Make me feel I'm worth the scratches

Hearts that don't love can't be broken
A dream stays a dream if not woken
If you never bleed then you won't understand
Come pick me red roses with your bare hands

A little pain let's you know you're alive
You've gotta live in love not just survive
