My days are as dark as my nights and I see no sunshine in sight
Your mem'ry keeps blocking my view and I'm living on mem'ries of you
Can't eat when I'm hungry can't sleep when I'm tired
And all of these tears can't put out this far
Your mem'ry just won't turn me loose and I'm living on mem'ries of you
There's just no forgetting about you how long can I survive without you
I just can't believe that we're through and I'm living on mem'ries of you
Can't eat when I'm hungry I can't sleep when I'm tired
And all of these tears can't run off this far
Oh your mem'ry just won't turn me loose and I'm living on mem'ries of you
Yes I'm living on mem'ries of you
