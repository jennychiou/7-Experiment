Tell me what you're made of,
You define nature
When it's right gotta tell me twice
Ain't about the drama
Have a little sauna
I light up when we turn off the lights
Don't care if they're looking out deeper
Baby they don't compare to you
Don't care if they keep up, I've got one option
Don't need nobody, no
Don't care if you ain't perfect, you're still worth it
Ain't got no number two

Hey ey, ey ey
I know one thing
I'm fired up
I feel so good
When we touch
Got no worries,
Got no doubts
My baby don't dance, don't dance
I'm mad, but he sure know how to get down
But he sure know how to get down

He ain't even got a Maybach,
I don't even want that,
'Cause what we've got feels so luxury, yes
You're not on the A-list, but baby you're the greatest
'Cause your love it may feel sweet favors
Don't care if they're looking out deeper
Baby they don't compare to you
Don't care if they keep up, I've got one option
Don't need nobody, no
Don't care if you ain't perfect, you're still worth it
Ain't got no number two

Hey ey, ey ey
I know one thing
I'm fired up
I feel so good
When we touch
Got no worries,
Got no doubts
My baby don't dance, don't dance
I'm mad, but he sure know how to get down
But he sure know how to get down
But he sure know how to get down
Yeah yeah

They don't make 'em like you baby
I don't care that you can't nay-nay
'Cause he do step off, yeah you do step off
He knows just how to get it, I am never let him go
He don't dance, but he take the lead though
I watch him all day got confused like Nemo
So fly, they cool for Heathrow
Two pack, hit the jackpot

I know one thing
I'm fired up
I feel so good
When we touch
Got no worries,
Got no doubts
My baby don't dance, don't dance
I'm mad, but he sure know how to get down
But he sure know how to get down
But he sure know how to get down
But he sure know how to get down
