The girl in the chair with the long golden hair
Well that used to be me
A flirtatious smile, unpredictably wild
Always trying to please

I was always walking one step ahead
Or so I thought until the monster crawled into my bed

The wild man erased
That shocked look on your face
Just cause your Mona Lisa is dead
A million words, it's a thousand days

The girl I used to be
Has a terrible case of mistaken identity
Yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity

The sun likes to rise and the moon likes to fall
And that's kind like my life
Now I've played the role of the nice girl next door
It gets cut like a knife

I'm not looking for apology eyes
And I don't wanna spend a night on a bed of beautiful ice
The breeze tells me why leave that sick all behind
Fast forward, fast forward a thousand days

The girl I used to be
Has a terrible case of mistaken identity
Yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity

It's not me
It's just not me
(Ooh, ooh)
That's not me

The girl I, the girl I used to be
Has a terrible case of mistaken identity
Yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity

That was the girl I used to be
A terrible case of mistaken identity
That was the girl I used to be
A terrible case of mistaken identity
