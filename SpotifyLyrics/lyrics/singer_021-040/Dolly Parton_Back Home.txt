Back home, back home 
Yes, I'm going back home 
Why I can't believe it's been this long 
Since I've seen mom and dad 
When I left my mountain home behind 
I left them both so sad 
My brothers and my sisters that were babies then are grown 
Years have past and now at last, I'm on my way back home 

Back home, back home 
Yes I'm going back home 
To the factory smoke and city life, I'm sayin' so long 
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone 
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home 

I got a letter from mama an' 
Mama asked me if I'd come back home 
She says it sure is lonesome now 
Since all of us kids are all growed up and gone 
I just can't hardly stand the thoughts of 
Momma and daddy being left there all alone 
That's really all I need to know 
And now I'm on the road back home 

Back home, back home 
Yes, I'm going back home 
To the smog an' smoke an' city life, I'm sayin' so long 
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone 
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home 

Back home, back home 
Yes, I'm going back home
