I like this right here
I like to hear you say hello
(Hello)

Hey girl, you're a stunner
You get me so high, like the supernova
I'm like oh oh, she's headed for the door
I tear down every fella just to be your only Casanova
Gotta get your number before you go

Staring at the ceiling, girl you got me dreaming
Listening to the dial tone
Take another minute
Push another digit
Girl, pick up your phone
(Hello)

'Cause I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear my heart beat through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello...

I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear me love you through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello...

Hey there, Juliet-et
Can you write me into your story?
Need a test to prove I can be your Romeo (Romeo)
City girl, you're my superstar
Forever you'll be tattooed on my heart
Waiting on one little word from you
Sitting in my room

Staring at the ceiling, girl you got me dreaming
Listening to the dial tone
Take another minute
Push another digit
Girl, pick up your phone
(Hello)

'Cause I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear my heart beat through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello...

I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear me love you through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello...

Staring at the ceiling
Now I know I'm dreaming
Looking at the ceiling
Girl, pick up your phone

'Cause I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear my heart beat through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello...

I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear me love you through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello...

'Cause I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear my heart beat through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello...

I just wanna hear you say hello
Hello... hello... hello...
Can you hear me love you through the phone?
Hello... hello... hello
