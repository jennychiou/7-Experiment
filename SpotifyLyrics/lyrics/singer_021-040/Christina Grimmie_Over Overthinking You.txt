Na-hey-hey-hey-hey

Just when I think everything's all right
That's when I overanalyze
I start running away from you
And I don't know why (don't know why)

I start to think I ain't right for you
But deep inside I know the truth
It's like my heart already beats for you
And I don't know why (don't know why)

What should I do
What should I say
Why's this bothering me?
Should I leave or should I stay
It's on repeat
Moving on I won't let it
Get the best of me

I'm over-over-over overthinking
You-you-you
Over-over-over overthinking
You-you-you
You-ooh-ooh You-ooh-ooh
Over-over overthinking
You-you-you
I'm over-over
Over-overthinking you

Na-hey-hey-hey-hey

Try to find something
Wrong with you but I'm
Running out of reasons to
You gave me feelings I never knew
And I don't know why (I don't know why)

What should I do
What should I say
Why's this bothering me?
Should I leave or should I stay
It's on repeat
Moving on I won't let it
Get the best of me

I'm over-over-over overthinking
You-you-you
Over-over-over overthinking
You-you-you
You-ooh-ooh You-ooh-ooh
Over-over overthinking
You-you-you
I'm over-over
Over-overthinking you

I don't wanna be afraid
To let things come into play. He's
Never been more certain that it's right
'Cause I'm

Over-over-over overthinking
You-you-you
Over-over-over overthinking
You-you-you
You-ooh-ooh You-ooh-ooh
Over-over overthinking
You-you-you
I'm over-over
Over-overthinking
Over-overthinking
You
