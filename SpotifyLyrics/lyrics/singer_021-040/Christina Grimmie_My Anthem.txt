Hope you guys like it
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Here is my new song
And it didn't take long
It's not a cover
I hope you won't bother

It's not karaoke
I'm keeping it low-key
I'm no physic
But I hope that you like it

Here it goes, now
Don't make me nervous
All I've got is a few random verses
I hope it gets you under the surface
I'm tryin' my best 'cause you really deserve it

Ooh, I wanna live for the moments
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah

Ooh, I wanna live for the feelings
That can live in this life for meaning
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' with them
And this is my anthem, yeah

Maybe it's tacky
This song makes me happy
If you sing it with me
Possibly maybe

If you think it's cheesy
You're singin' off-key
It won't matter to me
'Cause I'm feeling sunny

Here it goes, now
Don't ya get nervous
All we've got is a few random verses
I know it'll get you under the surface
You can't go wrong 'cause nobody's perfect

Ooh, I wanna live for the moments
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah

Ooh, I wanna live for the feelings
That can live in this life for meaning
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' with them
And this is my anthem, yeah

Here it goes, now
Don't ya get nervous
All we've got is a few random verses
I know it'll get you under the surface
You can't go wrong 'cause nobody's perfect

Ooh, I wanna live for the moments
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah

Ooh, I wanna live for the feelings
That can live in this life for meaning
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' with them
And this is my anthem, yeah
