I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white
