Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
May his name forever stand 
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
Was a mighty, mighty man 
And he enriched the lives 
Of everyone that ever knew him 
And in my song I hope to sing 
Some of the praise that's due him 

Dr. Thomas was a man 
The Lord must have appointed 
To live among us mountain folks 
In eastern Tennessee 
And he delivered more than half 
The babies in those mountains 
Among those babies 
He delivered me 

There was no way to drive along 
The roads back in those mountains 
But Dr. Thomas got there 
Just the same 
He often rode on horseback 
To get where he was needed 
But if he had to walk 
He always came 

Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
May his name forever stand 
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
Was a mighty, mighty man 
And he enriched the lives 
Of everyone that ever knew him 
And in my song I hope to sing 
Some of the praise that's due him 

Dr. Thomas was a friend 
A neighbor and a doctor 
Though he seldom got a dime 
For all he'd done 
And I remember lots of times 
We sent for Dr. Thomas 
But I don't recall a time 
He didn't come 

They say a man is judged 
By the deeds he does while livin' 
A judgement when he stands 
Before the Lord 
And I know heaven holds a place 
For men like Dr. Thomas 
And I know that he'll receive 
His just reward 

Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
May his name forever stand 
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
Was a mighty, mighty man 
And he enriched the lives 
Of everyone that ever knew him 
And in my song I hope to sing 
Some of the praise that's due him
