In a dream I was walkin' in a beautiful field
I was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill
When a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land
Jesus stood on the mountain and He held out His hand

Then He came down from the mountain, headed down to the sea
And the children strowed flowers in the path at His feet
And He was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild
Came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at His side

There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love
Ain't that a wonderful feelin', let us lift Him up

Then He suddenly vanished from the crowd down below
Reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow
He said your questions are many but the answer is love
I'll draw all men unto me if I be lifted up

There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love
There is life everlasting, let us lift Him up

He said if I
Be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up, what did he say
He said if I
Be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up

Let's lift Him higher and higher
And higher and higher each day
Let's lift Him up
He said if I
Be lifted up
Oh if I be lifted up

There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
There's a light in the darkness, and joy in His love
It's a wonderful feelin', lift Him up

He said if I
Be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up, that's what he said
He said if I
Be lifted up
If I be lifted up
