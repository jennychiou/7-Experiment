Come they told me our pa ra pa pum pum a newborn King to see pa ra pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring pa ra pa pum pum to lay before the King pa ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum
So to honor him pa ra pa pum pum when we come
Little baby pa ra pa pum pum I am a poor boy too pa ra pa pum pum
I have no gift to bring pa ra pa pum pum that's fit to give a King pa ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum ra pa pam pam ra pa pum pum
Oh shall I play for you pa ra pa pum pum on my drum
(Mary nodded yes pa ra pa pum pum the ox and lamb kept time pa ra pa pum pum
I played my drum for him pa ra pa pum pum
I played my best for him pa ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum)
Then he smiled at me pa ra pa pum pum me and my drum
Me and my drum me and my drum I played for him on my drum on my drum
