Oh sugar pie, honey bunch 
You know that I love you 
I can't help myself 
I love you and nobody else 
In and out my life 
You come and you go 
Leaving just your picture behind 
And I've kissed it a thousand times 

When you snap your fingers or wink your eye 
I come a running to you 
Tied to you like a ball-and-chain 
And there's nothing that I can do 

Can't help myself 
No, I can't help myself 

Sugar pie, honey bunch 
I'm weaker than a girl should be 
I can't help myself 
I'm a fool in love you see 

I wanna tell you I don't love you 
Tell you that we're through 
And I've tried 
But every time I see your face 
I get all choked up inside 

When I call your name 
Boy it starts the flame 
Burning in my heart 
Tearin' it all apart 
No matter how I try 
My love I cannot hide 

Sugar pie, honey bunch 
You now that I'm weak for you 
I can't help myself 
I love you and nobody else 

Ooh sugar pie honey bunch 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
I can't help myself 
I want you and nobody else 

Sugar pie, honey bunch 
You know that I love you 
I can't help myself 
No no no, I can't help myself
