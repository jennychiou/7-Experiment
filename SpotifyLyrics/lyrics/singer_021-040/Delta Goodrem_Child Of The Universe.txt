I grew up to be myself
Still I feel there's something else
Look at all the satellites colliding in the sky
We meet and we divide
The patterns made by human life
Look at all the stars tonight they're writing in the sky
Together we are all alone
All trying to make it home, home
Oh...

In this world 
If it's the only thing I've ever learned
Is that everything you love can hurt
And the only thing you are is a child of the universe
In this world 
If it's the only thing I've ever learned
Is that everything you love can hurt
And with everything my freedom's worth
I'll be a child of the universe

I am brave but I am scared
I am lonely
But I'm prepared
We are all connected without knowing 
Who we are
Together we are rolling stones
All trying to make it home, home
Oh...

In this world 
If it's the only thing I've ever learned
Is that everything you love can hurt
And the only thing you are is a child of the universe
In this world 
If it's the only thing I've ever learned
Is that everything you love can hurt
And with everything my freedom's worth
I'll be a child of the universe

In this world 
If it's the only thing I've ever learned
Is that everything you love can hurt
And the only thing you are is a child of the universe
In this world 
If it's the only thing I've ever learned
Is that everything you love can hurt
And with everything my freedom's worth
I'll be a child of the universe
I'll be a child of the universe
Child of the universe
