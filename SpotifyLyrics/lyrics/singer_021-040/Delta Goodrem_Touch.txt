This is the home where
Where my mother told me anything can happen
These are the pages where I kept my secrets underneath my bed
And a heart shaped necklace that my father bought me
Then there's the park bench where I gave my first kiss away (away)

This is the bedroom that I painted purple when I first left home
Then there's the journey that my car would take me to my days at work
And the mountain I climbed after I fought the rain
This is the goodbye that I gave my best friend for the very last time

Well I said to myself
Said to my lover
Everything feels your touch
Everything good reaches another
You never can feel too much
Ah, Ah
When a butterfly moves its wings
There's a storm happening somewhere

This is the feeling that only you can give me and it gives me chills
This is the last time that I said I need you but I always will
There's an old song that when it comes on the radio
I've gotta pull over because it makes me feel like I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

Well I said to myself
Said to my lover
Everything feels your touch
Everything good reaches another
You never can feel too much
Ah, Ah
When a butterfly moves its wings
There's a storm happening somewhere

Yes it does feel your touch, yes it does feel your touch, yes it does
Do you really have to ask me?
And your love, and your love feels your touch and your love feels your touch
Did you hear it from somebody?

I said to myself
Said to my lover
Everything feels your touch
Everything good reaches another
You never can feel too much
I said to myself
Said to my lover
Everything feels your touch
Everything good reaches another
You never can feel too much
I said to myself
Said to my lover
Everything feels your touch
Everything good reaches another
You never can feel too much
I said to myself
Said to my lover
Everything feels your touch
Everything good reaches another
You never can feel too much...
