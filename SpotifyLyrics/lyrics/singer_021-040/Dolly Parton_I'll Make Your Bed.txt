I'm not the kind of girl that married dear dad 
I don't bake apple pies and cookies from scratch 
I'm not even handy with a needle or thread 
But you'll never go hungry and I'll make your bed 
I'll make your bed a place you can't wait to go 
Softer than feathers and as sweet as a rose 
Smooth satin pillows I will fluff for your head 
And you'll want for nothin' and I'll make your bed 
I'll love you to sleep at night, wake you with a kiss 
Things that I can't do, I swear you won't miss 
I promised forever on the day that we meet 
That's love you truly and 
I'll make your bed 

Do-do-do-do-do-do, de-de-de-oh-h 
Do-do-do-do-do-do, de-de-de ah 
Do-do-do-do-do-do, de-de-de-oh-h 
I'll love you truly and I'll make your bed 

I'll clothe you in dreams or I will feed you with love 
Show you a magic life that few have dreamed of 
I know this can be the love you'll never regret 
'Cause I'm your forever and I'll make your bed 

I'll make your bed a place you can't wait to go 
Softer than feathers and as sweet as a rose 
Smooth satin pillows I will fluff for your head 
And I'll love you truly and 
I'll make your bed 

I'll love you to sleep at night, wake you with a kiss 
Things that I can't do, I swear you won't miss 
Forever and always I will prove what I said 
And love you a lifetime and 
I'll make your bed 
And you'll want for nothing and I'll make your bed 

Do-do-do-do-do-do, dum-de-de oh-h 
De-de-de-de-de-de, do-do-do ah 
Do-do-do-do-do-do, de-de-de oh 
I'll love you truly and I'll make your bed 

Do-do-do-do-do-do, da-de-de-de-oh-h 
De-de-da-de-de, dum-de-de-ah 
De-de-da-de, de-dum de-de-oh 
I'll love you truly and I'll make your bed
