I know what you're thinking when you look at me
The love in your eyes is so easy to see
It's real and it's good what I feel for you
Love is worth living when you love like we do

I understand when you're not feeling well
If there's something on your mind I always can tell
I'm there when you need me and you're there when I need you
Love is worth living when you love like we do

Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do

Love is worth living...
Love is worth living when you love like we do
