Déjà vu that's what I am feeling tonight with you
'Cause I promised myself I wouldn't lose my cool
But I am sucker for them pretty brown eyes, yeah, yeah

You got me doing things girl I've never done before
I tell myself that I, I just wanna let you go
'Cause you're the only one that I have an appetite for so here I go

I only came over to tell you girl it's over between you and I
And now that you've touched me I am having second thoughts
So I ain't gonna leave you tonight

'Cause my heart is paralyzed
(I can't move girl)
My heart is paralyzed
('Cause of you girl)

'Cause my heart is paralyzed
(I can't move girl)
My heart is paralyzed
('Cause of you girl)

Knocked off my feet on my way over to do my speech
Was gonna tell you we couldn't be perfect
But I keep trippin' every time you smile

You got me doing things I've never done before
I tell myself that I, I need to let you go
'Cause you're the only one that I have an appetite for so here I go

I only came over to tell you girl it's over between you and I
And now that you've touched me I am having second thoughts
So I ain't gonna leave you tonight

'Cause my heart is paralyzed
(I can't move girl)
My heart is paralyzed
('Cause of you girl)

'Cause my heart is paralyzed
(I can't move girl)
My heart is paralyzed
('Cause of you girl)

You see what I planned
I thought that I could put you in my past
Ooh yeah, but I guess I got it bad
Just turned to walk away but somehow I can't, no

I only came over to tell you girl it's over between you and I
And now that you've touched me I am having second thoughts
So I ain't gonna leave you tonight

'Cause my heart is paralyzed
(I can't move girl)
My heart is paralyzed
('Cause of you girl)

'Cause my heart is paralyzed
(I can't move girl)
My heart is paralyzed
('Cause of you girl)
