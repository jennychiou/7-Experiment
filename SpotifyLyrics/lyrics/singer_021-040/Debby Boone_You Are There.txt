In the evening when the kettle's on for tea 
An old familiar feeling settles over me 
And it's your face I see and I believe that you are there 

In the garden when I stop to touch a rose 
And feel the petal soft and sweet against my nose 
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there 

When I'm dreaming and I find myself awake 
Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize 
And all at once I realize it's morning 
And my fantasy is fading like a distant star of dawn 
My dearest dream is gone 
I often think there's just one thing to do 
Pretend the dream is true 
And tell myself that you are there
