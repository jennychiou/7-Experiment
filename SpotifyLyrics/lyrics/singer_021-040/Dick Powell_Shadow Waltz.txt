Shadows on the wall
I can see them fall
Here and there
Everywhere

Silhouettes in blue
Dancing in the dew
Here am I
Where are you?

In the shadows, let me come and sing to you
Let me dream a song that I can bring to you
Take me in your arms and let me cling to you
Let me linger long, let me live my song

In the winter, let me bring the spring to you
Let me feel that I mean everything to you
Love's old song will be new
In the shadows when I come and sing to you

(In the shadows, let me come and sing to you)
(Let me dream a song that I can bring to you)
Take me in your arms and let me cling to you
(Let me linger long, let me live my song)

In the winter, let me bring the spring to you
Let me feel that I mean everything to you
Love's old song will be new
In the shadows when I come and sing to you, dear
In the shadows when I come and sing to you

(In the shadows, let me come and sing to you)
(Let me dream a song that I can bring to you)
(Take me in your arms and let me cling to you)
(Let me linger long, let me live my song)

(Let me bring the spring to you)
(I mean everything to you)
(Love's old song will be new)
(In the shadows when I come and sing to you)

(In the winter, let me bring the spring to you)
(Let me feel that I mean everything to you)
(Love's old song will be new)
In the shadows when I come and sing to you, dear
In the shadows when I come and sing
