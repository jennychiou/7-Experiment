Tonight's my lucky night, I know 
He talked to me to tell me 
He's been thinking of me 
And all this time 
Has changed his mind 
Oh, he told me so 
That's how I know 
He's gonna love me 

Tonight's the night 
We'll turn out the lights 
And love again 
Like we did back then 
And we'll start all over tonight 

Tonight's my lucky night, I'm sure 
Oh, he's at the door 
I've waited for this chance to hold him 
And now I see he's needed me 
Oh, imagine that 
He's coming back to live forever 

Tonight's the night 
We'll turn out the lights 
And love again 
Like we did back then 
And we'll start all over 
We'll start all over 
We'll start all over 

Tonight's the night 
We'll turn out the lights 
And love again 
Like we did back then 
And we'll start all over 
We'll start all over 
We'll start all over 

Tonight
