Got my eye on a boy 
He's eyeing me back 
It's looking real good 
This could be it 
And I know that all of you girls 
Would love to steal him away 
He bought me a drink 
I thanked him real sweet 
It's always so nice when you first meet 
And I know that all of you women would love to steal him away 
So I'm warning you 

Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend 
Building up an appetite 
You can look but you can't buy 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend 

Pretty as a picture 
Comin' on so strong 
He's twisting my ignition key 
Turn my motor on 
But anyone can see, all his attention's on me 
Give us some privacy 

Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend 
Better keep your hands off my 
It's a welcome turn to try 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend 

Leave us alone tonight 
Then if it don't work out right 
He's all your's 
Until then 

Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend 
They keep crowdin' in on me 
He smiles rather unsuspiciously 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend 

Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend 
Building up an appetite 
You can look but you can't buy 
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
