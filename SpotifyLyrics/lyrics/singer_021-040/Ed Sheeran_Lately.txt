ED

I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
'Cause I know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves

I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
'Cause we all recognise, real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close

5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ah
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be...

The times I'm living in lately.

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong
But they won't slither in too easy, believe me I'm snake minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober 'cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!
Never die.

2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge,
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'cause I haven't slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ah
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be... x4
The times I'm living in lately.
