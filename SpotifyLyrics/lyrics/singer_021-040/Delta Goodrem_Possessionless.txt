All the things that I've collected, stones and shells
Every word in every book upon my shelves
Only form a brief description of myself
But they don't define who I am
I don't think anything can, no

If I strip away the non-necessities
All the damage, all the mess surrounding me

I don't crave what I have not
I don't need more than I've got
Just me that I offer up

All I got is my body and it's naked for you
All I got is this heart that I'm willing to lose
I know in this life
I give it everything
All I got is this soul and it's shedding its clothes
Do you see who I am now you're standing this close
You know in these arms you're feeling everything

I'm learning what to give, what to protect
To look into the mirror though I'm not perfect
It's a work in progress, hasn't finished yet
Wanna be transparent, see through
Not gonna hide me from you

All I got is my body and it's naked for you
All I got is this heart that I'm willing to lose
I know in this life
I give it everything
All I got is this soul and it's shedding its clothes
Do you see who I am now you're standing this close
You know in these arms you're feeling everything

I'm completely undressed but I couldn't care less
I'm standing here possessionless
It's the only true test
When the only thing left
Is a love that is possessionless

Is a love that is possessionless

I don't crave what I have not
I don't need more than I've got
Just me that I offer up

All I got is my body and it's naked for you
All I got is this heart that I'm willing to lose
I know in this life
I give it everything
All I got is this soul and it's shedding its clothes
Do you see who I am now you're standing this close
You know in these arms you're feeling everything

I'm completely undressed but I couldn't care less
I'm standing here possessionless
It's the only true test
When the only thing left
Is a love that is possessionless
