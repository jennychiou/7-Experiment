There was a little boy I had planned to marry 
This was my love; I didn't want to share it 
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny 
Said he couldn't love me 'cause he didn't have no money 

So, everyday I have to cry some 
Everyday I have to cry some 
Dry the water from my eyes some 
Everyday I have to cry 

Had me a boy 
I guess I really loved him 
Every night now I was thinking of him 
But you can't mix love with money 
'Cause if you do it's gonna hurt somebody 

So, everyday I have to cry some 
Everyday I have to cry some 
Dry the water from my eyes some 
Everyday I have to cry 

Although I know that he's just a poor man 
Is it wrong to love 'cause he's not a rich man? 
Every time you mix love with money 
Every time you hurt somebody 

So, everyday I have to cry some 
Everyday I have to cry some 
Dry the water from my eyes some 
Everyday I have to cry
