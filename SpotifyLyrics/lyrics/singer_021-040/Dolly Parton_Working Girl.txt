Some men find her sexy, some men disagree
But if she's not, it's not because she doesn't want to be
She wears a push-up bra from Freddericks, five inch high heel shoes
Maybelline and Rubinstein, and Avon's best perfume
She's a working girl

She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl

Some find her to aggressive, she don't know how to stop
'Cause she's the kind that don't look down until it's from the top
She's elegant and stylish, French perfume and a fur
Designer clothes by Halston and Diane Von Furstenburg
And she's a working girl

She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl

She has taken her place among the tallest of trees
But she weeps like a willow when she's brought to her knees
'Cause she's a working girl

You'll find her dressed according to standard uniform
'Cause she must dress in comfort for the job she must perform
She has so many faces, she wears so many names
She goes so many places and she does so many things
'Cause she's a working girl

She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl

She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl

She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
