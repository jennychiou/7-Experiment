He's a go-getter a go-getter
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her

Now I've got a neighbor that lives down the road away
His wife holds down a steady job he don't turn his hand all day
I know that most of you will know the kind I'm talking about
The kind that rather than have to work yeah he'd rather do without
But he's a go-getter a go-getter...

There's a group of men in the courthouse yard anytime that you go by
A playin' checkers and tradin' knives and makin' jokes about their wives
They'll wait all week for payday and they hope that money's plenty
And the wife that worked those long hard hours never gets a penny
But he's a go-getter...
Yes he's a go-getter...
He's a go-getter...
