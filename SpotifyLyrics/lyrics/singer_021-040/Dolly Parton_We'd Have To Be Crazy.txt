Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy to put up with the crazy things we do
Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy but you know I'm crazy about you

Either I'm crazy or you are one or maybe it's me and you
For we'd have to be crazy to live like this and go through what we go through
Well our love's so strong but we can't get along there's never a minute of peace
If I ain't a querrellin' and a fussin' at you you're a querrellin' and a fussin' at me

Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy...

Well we must love to live like this in our subconscious minds
How can you love somebody so much and despite 'em at the very same time
I guess our fightin's the only excitement we have in our life
Would you think all people could live like this we couldn't be too bright

Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy...
