We'd get up before sun-up to get the work done up 
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down 
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched 
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground 
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past 
In the good old days when times were bad 

No amount of money could buy from me 
The memories that I have of then 
No amount of money could pay me 
To go back and live through it again 

I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed 
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board 
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness 
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford 
Anything at all was more than we had 
In the good old days when times were bad 

We've got up before and found ice on the floor 
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall 
And I couldn't enjoy then, havin' a boyfriend 
I had nothing decent to wear at all 
So I long for a love that I never had 
In the good old days when times were bad 

No amount of money could buy from me 
The memories that I have of then 
No amount of money could pay me 
To go back and live through it again 

In the good old days when times were bad 
In the good old days when times were bad
