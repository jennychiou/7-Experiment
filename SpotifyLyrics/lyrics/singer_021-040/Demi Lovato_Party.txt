I saw you lookin' over
Now I see you movin' this way
Pushin' through the crowd
Like you got something to say, yeah
But you couldn't walk
Cause the music's taken over your feet
I could tell by your toes
That you're rockin' to this beat

You gotta dance till you ache
Till you drop, till you break
Free your soul let me see you shake
One by one we're stealing the stage
Here we come, so get out of our way

It won't be long till the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it out loud, Yeah

I know your type
And all the hype is goin' straight to your head
And everybody's stoppin' what their doin'
Cause your face is turnin' red, yeah
Gotta learn how to move to the grove
Give in, or get out
Put your hands in the air
Stand up in your chair and shout

You're all dolled up with nowhere to go
You wanna get out and put on a show
There's nothin' wrong with stayin' home
As long as you've got your radio

It won't be long till the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it
Don't wait, and don't ya be late
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it out loud

Come on!
Dallas, Texas,
Bring it home for me baby!

The little things that you do
From across the room
I see you're sending me clues
They're in the way you make me move

It won't be long till the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it
Don't wait, and don't ya be late
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
And scream it out loud

Scream it out loud
Get your, get your party on
Let's do it again!
