We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Born a king on Bethleem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

Star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Frankincense and moor have I
My gift of love and sacrifice
Prayer and praysing all men raising
Worshipping God most high

Oh, star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
We three kings
