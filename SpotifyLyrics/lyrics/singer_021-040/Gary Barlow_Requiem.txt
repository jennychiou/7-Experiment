Hatches matches then dispatches
All in the embers of my ashes
Thy will was done
Oh wipe that worry from your face
You'll die when you see my new place but
Do the time
You're in for life

Oh my friends I hear you sing
The lord's my shepherd really what a song to sing
Why bring me flowers
When you know that I can't smell a thing
For the folks I leave behind
I'm in heaven well imagine my surprise
I'm really flattered that you came here to remember
And look I made the news again
In Requiem, with all my friends

There is no shame here, I feel no loss
The pawn and king both in the same box
And no one famous
Please don't panic
It looks so tragic
All switching seats on the Titanic
I'm sad to go
Hope you enjoy the show

Oh my friends I hear you say
A lot of lovely things about me here today
I'm glad you didn't let the truth get in the way
To all my friends I leave behind
They put a spread on so let's all go back to mine
I really love it that you came here to remember
And look we made the news at ten
In Requiem with all my friends

This dyin' ain't much of a living no no
Will we want what we're given heaven knows

Oh my friends I hear you sing
The lord's my shepherd really what a song to sing
Why bring me flowers when you
Know that I can't smell a thing
For the folks I leave behind
I'm in heaven well imagine my surprise
I'm really flattered that you came here to remember
And look I made the news again
In Requiem with all my friends

With all my friends
Requiem
