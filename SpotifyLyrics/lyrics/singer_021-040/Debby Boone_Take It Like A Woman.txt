Sometimes I think I love you
Sometimes I just don't know
It feels so good when you hold me
But it hurts when you let go
I understand your feelings
But understand mine too
While your heart belongs to someone else
What is mine supposed to do

Woman it's time you stopped your dreaming
All the lying and the scheming
Won't keep you warm at night
So face it, woman, no sense feeling bad
You can't lose what you never had
So dry your eyes and take it like a woman

I said in the beginning
Wouldn't let it get this far
'Cause there's no chance in wining
With things the way they are
But somewhere along the feelings
You became a part of me
And I can't share your love with someone else
Without it killing me

Woman it's time you stopped your dreaming
All the lying and the scheming
Won't keep you warm at night
So face it, woman, no sense feeling bad
You can't lose what you never had
So dry your eyes and take it like a woman
