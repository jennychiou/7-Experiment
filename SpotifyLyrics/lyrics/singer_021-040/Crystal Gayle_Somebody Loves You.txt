It's been a long time since you went away
I stop to think of you most every day
With all my heart I'm hoping you're okay
Guess who loves you, somebody loves you

I couldn't reach you by the U.S. mail
You didn't leave a very easy trail
I tried to telephone to no avail
Guess who loves you, somebody loves you
I do

I know the matter is the game I played
I'll never reach you any other way
So I send this one thought to you every day
Guess who loves you, somebody loves you
I do
