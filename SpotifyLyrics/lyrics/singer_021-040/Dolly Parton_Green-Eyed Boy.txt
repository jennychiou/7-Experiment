I flew off to the wild blue yonder 
'Cause I had a dream 
And I had to go 
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder 
From the love I shared 
With a green-eyed boy 
Lips as sweet as mountain honey 
A body warm as home made wine 
But he had no dreams 
And no means for money 
But he had me just anytime 

Take me back, If just in memory 
Fill my cup again with joy 
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney 
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy 

Now he was pretty 
With chiseled features 
Like the movie stars in the magazines 
My first love and the son of a preacher 
I fantasized me was James Dean 

But the world outside kept pulling at me 
Offered me fame, respect, and gold 
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion 
Expensive cars, so I chose those 

Take me back, If just in memory 
Fill my cup again with joy 
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney 
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy 

Take me back, If just in memory 
Fill my cup again with joy 
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney 
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy 

Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss 
That green-eyed boy 

Do you think about me 
When the nights are long and cold 
Do you ever miss me 
Do you my green-eyed boy
