A young couple marries, already fighting 
Along comes baby makin' them three 
Trouble's all he hears from the time he's in didies 
Baby don't know just what to believe 
Angry words and spiteful actions 
Baby's gonna cut his teeth on these 
If that's gonna be the main attraction 
What will the baby be, what will baby be 
Baby needs love and needs direction 
Baby's first school is the family 
For they are only a reflection 
Of the things they see, what will baby be 

What will baby be after baby is grown 
What will baby do if baby don't know what's right or wrong 
Got to show them love, got to teach them truth 
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up 
Well, that depends entirely on me and you 
Depends entirely on me and you 

Baby thinks God is just a curse word 
Never said a prayer 'cause he's never been taught 
They remember and repeat what they've heard 
So I ask who's really at fault 

So many questions, so few answers 
So many lessons we don't teach 
Stumbling through like clumsy dancers 
What will baby be, what will baby be 

What will baby be after baby is grown 
What will baby do when baby is out there on his own 
Teach the children how to be all they should be 
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up 
Depends entirely on you and me 
Depends entirely on you and me 
What will baby be
