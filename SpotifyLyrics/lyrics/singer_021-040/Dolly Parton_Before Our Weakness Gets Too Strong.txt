What are we doin' in this place alone
Is our desire to relive our past this strong
The love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
If we live our past in the present, our future will be gone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Blind with temptation we race into the past
On a road too small to let the past and present pass
Are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
If we live our past in the present, our future will be gone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
