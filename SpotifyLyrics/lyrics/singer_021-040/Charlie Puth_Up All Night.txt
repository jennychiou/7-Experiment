Well I get the thrill run down my spine
When I see you hitting me up
Feeling so electrified
With the heat of a million suns
You know just one touch can keep me high
And I think I'll never come down
Till a couple days go by
And you're nowhere to be found

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

So I try to shake you out my head
Try to dance with somebody new
But you got those lips so red
And that smoking voice, you do
So I know it's pointless anyway
Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

If I wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll come back around
Wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll be ready now
'Cause I would wait forever
For you to fall back into my arms
So come on

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
