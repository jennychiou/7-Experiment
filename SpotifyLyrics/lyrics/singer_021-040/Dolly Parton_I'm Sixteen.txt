I'm sixteen burstin' at the seams
I'm back in my teens
Caution to the wind, yeah
You love me and what could be
More rejuvenating, I am young again

I'm sixteen, I'm sixteen
Loving you's a dream
And life is a breeze
Kickin' up my heels
Haven't had such thrills
Since I was sixteen cruisin' round the Tasty Freeze

It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me

Baby, we can go to the drive-in show
Drinking Cherry Coke and Concession Trees
And maybe kiss and hug
Doing all that stuff
Always leading up
To that old back seat

I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
We're in love
Oh, happy days
You and me, we are wild and free
We'll go steady until your daddy takes the T-bird away

It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me
Watch me

You and I take a little dive
In the mill pond after midnight in our birthday suit
Makin' sweet, sweet love
Meet the stars above
Sneakin' back in through the window
'Fore the clock strikes two, yeah

I'm sixteen, burstin' at the seams
I'm back in my jeans
And I feel no pain
Kickin' up my heels
Haven't had such thrills
Since drivin' my old Chevy down Lovers' Lane

It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me

Yeah, I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
Caution to the wind
I'm sixteen, I'm sixteen
I'm sixteen, I feel young again

I'm sixteen
Don't I look sixteen?
You don't have to say
But I feel sixteen
