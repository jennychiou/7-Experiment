I can't explain what's going on
Something happened when you came along, oh
It's driving me crazy, crazy
You're taking me to new places
And I pretend I'm not anxious, but oh
You're driving me crazy, crazy

I was walking down this broken road
I was stranded, I was all alone
Always played it safe when it came to love
Until you came and picked me up

I've been waitin' all night, lookin' for your headlights
I know that we're strangers, but I'll leave it all for you
Go anywhere you wanna go
I don't really need to know, if my heart is in danger
'Cause as long as you're the driver
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah, yeah

Don't even know where we're going
You make me live in the moment, oh
Keep driving us, baby

I was walking down this broken road
I was stranded, I was all alone
Always played it safe when it came to love
Until you came and picked me up

I've been waitin' all night, lookin' for your headlights
I know that we're strangers, but I'll leave it all for you (yes I will)
Go anywhere you wanna go
I don't really need to know, if my heart is in danger
'Cause as long as you're the driver
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah, yeah

Take me where you wanna go (baby)
As long as you're the driver, I'm your hitchhiker
Yeah

I've been waitin' all night, lookin' for your headlights
I know that we're strangers, but I'll leave it all for you (yes I will)
Go anywhere you wanna go
I don't really need to know, if my heart is in danger
'Cause as long as you're the driver
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah, yeah
