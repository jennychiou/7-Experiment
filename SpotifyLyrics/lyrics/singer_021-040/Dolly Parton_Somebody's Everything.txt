I just wanna be somebody's everything

You say I've seen too many movies, watched way too much TV
Read too many fairy tales that I live and make believe
You say the kind of love I'm dreamin' of does not exist
And there's no one like I'm searching for
Well I believe there is

And I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me
Have a lust within their touch, a passion far beyond belief
Reality and fantasy should be one in the same
And I want to be somebody's everything

I refuse to settle for someting less than great
And if it takes a lifetime, then that's how long I'll wait
Cause all I want is everything
Is that too much to ask?
Have romance, love, and passion
Find magic that will last

And I want someone to think they're dyin' if they can't be with me
I want to be their joy, their pride, their dreams, the very air they breathe
I'd like to wake up feeling loved and go to bed the same
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything
Somebody's everything

Oh, I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me
Have a lust within their touch, a passion far beyond belief
I'd like to wake up feeling loved and go to bed the same
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything

Someone to hold me close and tremble when the lovin's done
Think it's Heaven, call me Angel, think I hung the moon and sun
Get misty-eyed just knowin' we're the love song people sing
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything
And I want to be somebody's everything

I wanna be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything
I wanna be, I wanna be somebody's everything
Somebody's everything
Somebody's everything
Yes, I wanna be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything
