You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity
Not knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'd always be close by your side

You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still

You broke a heart, dear, that would die for you
I'd give this world, dear, to belong to you
The game is over, now I and we've both lost
Our broken hearts will have to pay the cost

You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
