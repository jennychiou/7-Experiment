Today tomorrow and forever that's how long our love will last
I'll never stop loving you no never today tomorrow and forever

We've got the kind of love most people dream about
We're sure of our love in our mind there's no doubt
And I know that you love me by the things you do and say
And our love keeps growing stronger day after day
Today tomorrow and forever...

Each day you let me know just how much you care
And you know if you need me you know I'm always there
You don't have to say you love me over and over again
I know because you show me and I know our love won't end
Today tomorrow and forever...
