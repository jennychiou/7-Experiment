You reeled me in with your smile
You made me melt with your voice
Now, I've been gone now for a while
Just to find that I'm your seventh choice

And I don't wanna pay the cost
But it be best if you get lost,
'Cause we know you'll never change

Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head,
'Cause you're wasting your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play 'cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught

You promise me all of your time
I guess I'm not the only one
But see, it's my heart on the line this time
I'm your number one, or gone

Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head,
'Cause you're wasting your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play 'cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught

Go and try to get me back
(You won't get me back,
You won't get me back)
Don't forget about our past
(I won't forget, no)

Never had the guts to leave,
Now you're making it
(So much easier)
"You know you're making it
Now you're making it
You're making it"
Much easier for me to see

Don't say that your sorry
For breaking every inch of my heart
I should've known from the start
Now it's time to get lost

And don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head,
'Cause you're wasting your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play 'cause you had you shot
You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught

You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught
