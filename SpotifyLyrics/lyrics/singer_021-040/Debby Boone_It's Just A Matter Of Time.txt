One night long ago sittin' on my daddy's knee
I said, "I'm so sad and lonely
And I guess that's how I'll always be"
He said, "Stop, don't you cry
'Cause you know your time will come
You gotta learn to walk before you try to run"

He told me
"Patience is all you really need to pray for
'Cause you're so sweet and you're looking fine
Soon someday you'll be turnin' away the boys from your door
And you'll see that's the way it'll be
It's just a matter of time"

Time rolls by
I saw my life beginning to chain
I grew up and made some friends and started having fun
But I told mama somehow
That loneliness still causes me pain
I tell myself I'm waitin' for that special one

She told me
"Patience is all you really need to pray for
'Cause your beauty is rare, a very special kind
Enjoy your life, soon you'll be a wife with a man to care for
You'll see that's the way it'll be
It's just a matter of time"

Then one day you came along
He seemed to step right out of my dream
When I saw you, my troubles were through
While my worries were left behind
But you say you gotta wait
Still it's not as long as it seems
'Til the day we're one, and you always will be mine

You tell me
"Patience is all you really need to pray for
A girl like you is, oh, so hard to find
So I know I'll never let you go
You're the love I live for
Soon you'll see that's the way it'll be
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time"
