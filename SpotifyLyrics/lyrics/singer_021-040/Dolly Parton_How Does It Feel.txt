I know that you're out there 
Knowing that there's someone out here thinkin' of you 
In your heart and in your mind 
I know there is no doubt that someone loves you 
I know that you know 
That I'll be waiting here when you have need of me 
And when the world has chained you down 
I know you know my love will set you free 

How does it feel to know that someone loves you 
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you 
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you 
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you 

I have come to know and love you 
Like I've never known or loved another 
Words have not been made 
That could describe these feelings 
We have for each other 
And I would go to any length 
To let you know at all times how I care 
'Cause I want you to know 
That any time you reach for me you'll find me there 

How does it feel to know that someone loves you 
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you 
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you 
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you 

Someone loves you, how does it feel to know it 
Someone loves you, how does it feel to know 
That someone loves you, someone loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel 
How does it feel to know that someone loves you 
Somebody loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel 
How does it feel to know that someone loves you 
Someone loves you, somebody loves you 
Somebody loves you, how does it feel to know it 
Somebody loves you
