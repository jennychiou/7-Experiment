You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
See, I'm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes and then I saw Alice staring back at me
And I will try to find another one who's suited to me
As well as her

I've moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

She was mine, I was hers and all that's in between
When she would cry, I would shelter her and keep her
From the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear, woah

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
If you cut deep then I might learn
If you scar and leave me like sunburn

Don't drop me in, it's not my time
If you cut deep then I might learn
You scarred and left me, like sunburn

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
