Time after time 
I tell myself that I'm 
So lucky to be loving you 

So lucky to be 
The one you run to see 
In the evening 
When the day is through 

I only know what I know 
The passing years will show 
You've kept my love so young 
So new 
And time after time 
You'll hear me say that I'm 
So lucky to be loving you 

I only know what I know 
The passing years will show 
You've kept my love so young 
So new 
And time after time 
You'll hear me say that I'm 
So lucky to be loving you
