Watch out!
Money, diamonds, shiny things
I can get all that stuff on my own
A little loving comes for free
Can't get right at me if you ain't home

If you don't change your ways
Then I'll go walk right out the door saying
Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone
If you don't change your ways
Then I'll go walk right out the door saying
Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone

You got me so mad, I know you ain't bad
I wish that you could see that you winning
'Cause you have it
Yeah it's so sad, you got me like that
And I don't know why I'm hanging on you it's so tragic
You know you got me coming back like a drug addict
You make me feel like staying with you was a bad habit
Yes you like chance, baby best grab it
I'm too fly to carry on with this baggage

If you don't change your ways
Then I'll go walk right out the door saying
Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone
If you don't change your ways
Then I'll go walk right out the door saying
Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone

Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone
You gotta leave me alone
Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone
Love, love me or leave me alone
Watch out now!

You said you love me
You said you'll never leave me alone
You said you're thinking of taking a minute to make in a house a new home
I say I never had it better, never say never
You taking a break when you should be making it better
Whatever, take the drums, take cars, I don't need cash back
Got my license, take the keys, I don't need the hatch back
I ain't lying, stop believing, ain't no need to back track
I'ma leave your ass quicker than a Snapchat

Money, diamonds, shiny things
I can get all that stuff on my own
A little loving comes for free
Can't get right at me if you ain't home

If you don't change your ways
Then I'll go walk right out the door saying
Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone
If you don't change your ways
Then I'll go walk right out the door saying
Love, love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone

Watch out now, hey
No, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Love, love me or leave me alone
Singing love me or leave me alone.
