Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey jingle bells jingle bells...

Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Oh jingle bells jingle bells...

Oh jingle bells jingle bells...
