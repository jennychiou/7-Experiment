"'DEV"'
I wanna get you by yourself
Yeah, have you to myself
I don't need nobody else
Don't want nobody else
You're special, I know
Your smile, it glows
It's perfect, it shows
Let's go

"'DEMI"'
I been starin' at ya
And I could do it all night
You're lookin' like an angel
With a kind a body needs a spotlight

Ain't nobody know your name
But lookin' like you do could be fame-ous
I could see us making waves
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade

Now, don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I never seen
No, one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy? 
Who's that boy?

You could say that I'm distracted
But ah you got me so attracted
But boy I'll tell you what the fact is
Is no one else in this room
Lookin' like like you, you, do

Ain't nobody know your name
But lookin' like you do could be fame-ous
I could see us making waves
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade

Now I don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I never seen
No, one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy? 
Who's that boy?

Who's that, boy 
Who's that, boy
Who's that, boy
Who's that, boy

Everybody in the club turn around sayin' who's that? 
Who's that?
Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes tell me who's that? 
Who's that?

"'DEV"'
I got my eye on this boy
Can't get him off my mind
He's one of a kind
The cherry to my pie
I just wanna get him close
Wanna make him mine
Come hold my hand, and dance away the night
Give me the green light
Kiss my lips
Who's that, boy watching my hips?
I-I-I wanna know who you are
My name is Dev, and you can be my star

Don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home
And get you all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy?

Oh, he got me
No, I never seen
No, one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy? Who's that boy?

Who's that boy? Who's that boy?
Tell me, who's that...
Who's that...
