Teardrops they fall like rain
But I'm not crying, oho, oho
I'm breaking off those chains
You got me tied in, oho, oho

One way ticket out of this heart breaking city
Get ready, karma is giving
And don't come knocking
When you feel lonely
You're not the only one out there for me

Tears will dry
And I'll forget the way you call my name
Just give me one more night
And I'll be dancing in the dark again

I love the smoking lights
I'll love whoever, oho, oho
And I don't miss those nights
They do it better, oho, oho

One way ticket out of this heart breaking city
Get ready, karma is giving
And don't come knocking
When you feel lonely
You're not the only one out there for me

Tears will dry
And I'll forget the way you call my name
Just give me one more night
And I'll be dancing in the dark again

I'm gonna dance all night
You're not gonna catch me crying
I'm gonna dance all night
You're not gonna catch me crying
I'm gonna dance all night
You're not gonna catch me crying
I'm gonna dance all night
You're not gonna catch me crying

Tears will dry
And I'll forget the way you call my name
Just give me one more night
And I'll be dancing in the dark again
Tears will dry
And I'll forget the way you call my name
Just give me one more night
And I'll be dancing in the dark again

I'm gonna dance all night
You're not gonna catch me crying
I'm gonna dance all night
You're not gonna catch me crying
