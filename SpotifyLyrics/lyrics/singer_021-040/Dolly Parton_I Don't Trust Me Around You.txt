You're standing much too close to me again
I've never once touched you but in my mind I've already sinned
You're making it hard for me to be true I don't trust me around you
Seems like every place I go I'll see you there
I can't keep my eyes off you I just stand and stare
You tempt me more than anyone I ever knew I don't trust me around you
I don't trust me around you I belong to someone else not once have I been untrue
But when I'm close to you this way I find myself want it to
I don't trust me around you
I don't trust me...
No I don't trust me around you
