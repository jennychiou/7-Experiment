I believe we have the right combination
Our love and happiness both seem so strong
I believe we have a firm foundation
That our love can build and last forever on

There'll be times when you may doubt my reasons
But I know your love will always make a way
And I know that there'll be times
When we'll have heartaches
But it won't worry us cause love is just that way

I believe we have the right combination
Our love and happiness both seem so strong
I believe we have a firm foundation
That our love can build and last forever on

Some folks spend a lifetime searching for the right one
And they'll grasp at anyone of love's sensations
But you and I will search the most for we have found (yes we have honey)
You and I have found the right combination

I believe we have the right combination
Our love and happiness both seem so strong
I believe we have a firm foundation
That our love can build and last forever on
