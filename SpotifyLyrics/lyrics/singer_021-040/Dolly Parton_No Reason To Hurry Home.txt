There is no love and there is no hate
There is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me
But we might as well stare at the wall

Cause you don't see me and I don't see you
Just a shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home

There's no tiny hands to reach out to us
No plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone
There's only sadness in store

We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to
No reason to hurry home
