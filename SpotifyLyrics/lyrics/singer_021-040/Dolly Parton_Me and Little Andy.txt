Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog-a-barkin'.
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a knockin'.
I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm.
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms.

Before I could say a word she said,
"My name is Sandy. And this here is my puppy dog,
It's name is little Andy."
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress.
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said.

"Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy?

Patty cake, a baker's man, my mommy ran away again.
We was all alone and didn't know what else to do,
I wondered if you'd let us stay with you.

Giddyup Charlie horse, going to the mill.
Can we stay all night?
If you don't love us, no one will, I promise we won't cry!
London Bridge is falling down, my daddy's drunk again in town.
We was all alone and didn't know what we could do.
We wondered if you'd let us stay with you."

She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven.
That night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven.
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone.
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone.

"Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy."
