She don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart
Fairly well I know you're leavin'
For the new love that you found
The pretty girl that you've been dating
Oh I've got a feeling she's gonna put you down

'Cause she don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart

She uses all the great quotations
She says all the things I wish I could say
But she's had so many rehearsals
Oh, to her it's just a lover's play

But wait when the final act is over
And you're left standin' all alone
When she takes her bow and makes her exit
Oh, well I'll be there to take you home

She don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart
