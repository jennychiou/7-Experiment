All I ever really wanted was someone to love me this good
You love me so good
Everybody knows I'm capable of breaking hearts like I've done
I've scarred more than one

I, I, I
You and I
Get along like thunder and the rain
You, ooh, ooh
Make me feel everything, even when it's pain

Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break
Break up to make up
Just to wake up with mascara all over my face
And I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
Cry, baby

How could someone so beautiful be so damn ugly
I guess I'm naive
'Cause every time I start tripping, slipping then I'm falling too deep
Stuck in a bad dream

I, I, I
You and I
Get along like fire to a plane
You, you, you
Make me feel like I'm fucking going so insane

Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break
Break up to make up
Just to wake up with mascara all over my face
And I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
Cry, baby

Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break

Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break
Break up to make up
Just to wake up with mascara all over my face
And I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
Cry, baby
