That's the way love is, you have to love and learn

I've lost again
Why can't I win?
These tears that I cry
Make my eyes burn

Each new love I find
Turns out to be the wrong kind
And it looks like I'll
Just have to love and learn

Love and learn
Hurt and yearn
For someone who will
Love me in return

I'll be hurt many times
Before the right one, I find
But that's the way love is
You have to love and learn

Love and learn
Just hurt and yearn
For someone
Who will love me in return

I'll be hurt many times
Before the right one, I find
But that's the way love is
You have to love and learn
Yes, that's the way love is
You have to love and learn
