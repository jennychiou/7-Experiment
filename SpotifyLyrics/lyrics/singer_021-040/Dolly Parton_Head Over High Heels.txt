Put on my tight dress
Hair teased on my head
I painted my lips red
And my eyes like Adele
I step in my high shoes
Cheeks blushed in rose rouge
I'm lookin' too cool
But you never can tell

When I look in his face
My heart begins to race
It's just a disgrace
These thoughts that I think

When he holds me to him
I want to woo him
I want to undo him
And don't think I ain't

Head over high heels
I'm head over high, high heels
Head over high heels in love
I've never known such thrills
I can't believe how this feels
I'm head over high heels in love
Head over high heels in love

Oh, racing heart be still
I'm hoping he will
Make love to me 'til the sun's comin' up
Have mercy on my soul
I'm losing control
Head over high heels and I can't get enough

Well I put on my sexy dress
Hair piled on my head
Painted my lips red
I got a hot date tonight
I step in my high shoes
Cheeks blushed in rose rouge
I'm feeling too cool
Even glittered my eyes

Head over high heels
I'm head over high, high heels
Head over high heels in love, in love
I've never known such thrills
I can't believe how this feels
I am head over high heels in love

Sure enough, I'm head over high heels in love
Can't get enough
I'm head over high heels in love
I'm head over high heels in
Love

Head over high heels in love
