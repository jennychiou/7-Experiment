I wish I could come back to you, dear 
I know that you want me, too 
But too much water run under that old bridge 
There's too many rivers between me and you 

There's just too many rivers to cross, babe 
Too many dreams have been lost 
And there's too many long nights 
I've turned and tossed 
There's too many rivers to cross 

Now don't think for a moment I blame only you 
We both killed the fruit on the vine 
And when you try to put love back together 
There's always a few little pieces you can't find 

Yes, there's too many rivers to cross, babe 
Too many dreams have been lost 
And there's too many long nights 
That I've turned and I've tossed 
There's too many rivers to cross 

There's too many rivers to cross
