Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man!
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can!

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene.

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
But I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene.

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man!
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can!

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene.

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man!
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can!
Jolene (Jolene).
