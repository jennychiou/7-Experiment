I can't live with you when you try to own me
Though you may give me love like I have never known
But if you try to control me then you won't never know me
And I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
So love me just for what I am don't try to change a thing
And I'll take you just like you are and I'll expect the same
So if you want to love me you must understand all of me
For I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
And I have no control over what I feel inside
And I can't change the way I am and you must be satisfied
So if you think you can't be without place and chance on me
Then I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong

I have no control...
I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
