He wanted more from like 
Than four kids and a wife 
And a job in the dark Kentucky mines 
A twenty-acre farm 
With a shacky house and barn 
That's all he had 
And all he left behind 
At gambling he was lucky 
So he left Kentucky 
Left behind his woman and his kids 
Into the gay casino 
In Nevada's town of Reno 
Kentucky gambler planned to get rich quick 

Kentucky gambler, who's gonna love your woman in Kentucky 
Who's gonna be the one to give her what she needs 
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna raise your children in Kentucky 
Who's gonna keep them fed and keep shoes on their feet 

At the gamblers' paradise 
Lady luck was on his side 
Kentucky gambler played his cards just right 
He won at everything he played 
Kentucky gambler had it made 
And he should have quit and gone on home that night 

But when you love the greenback dollar 
Sorrow's always bound to follow 
Reno dreams fade into neon amber
And lady luck, she'll lead you on
She'll stay awhile, and then she's gone
You'd better go on home Kentucky gambler

But a gambler never seems to stop 
'Til he loses all he's got 
And so, Kentucky gambler, he played on 
He played 'til he lost all he won 
He was right back where he started from 
Then he started wanting to go home 

Kentucky gambler, there ain't nobody waiting in Kentucky 
When you walked out, somebody else walked in 
Kentucky gambler, looks like you ain't really very lucky 
Seems to me a gambler looses much more than he wins 

So you think about it, Kentucky gambler
