So much is happening to me.
So much that I can't even see.
So many words of wisdom that I am trying to be.
Catch me if I should fall.
And even more so while I'm standing tall.

My head is spinning around and it's making me dizzy.
I'm spinning around and it's making me ill.
You don't understand what I'm going through just to find a way to climb.
It'll be in my own time.
It'll be in my own time.

Whispering thoughts in all different ways.
That I'm in a daze.
My head is spinning around and it's making me dizzy.
I'm spinning around and it's making me ill.
You don't understand what I'm going through just to find a way to climb.

It'll be in my own time.
'Cause it'll be in my own time.
In my own time.
In my own time I'll take a chance.
In my own time I'll find romance. In my own time.

It'll be mine.
After the clouds there'll be the rain.
After the sun there'll be the moon it doesn't matter.
'Cause it'll be in my own time
