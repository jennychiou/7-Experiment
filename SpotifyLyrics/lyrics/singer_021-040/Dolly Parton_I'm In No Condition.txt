Don't look at me with love in your eyes 
Go look at somebody that can make it worthwhile 
I'm hurt from a love affair I didn't want in 
I'm in no condition to try to love again 
Don't smile at me because it's no use 
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give to you 
Someday, you might look me up, but let me be till then 
For I'm in no condition to try to love again 
I'm in no condition to try to love again 

Man I love just broke my heart 
And it must have time to mend 
He have me the breeze 
Now he's gone with the wind 
I'm in no condition to try to love again 

I'm in no condition to try to love again 
Man I love just broke my heart 
And it must have time to mend 
He have me the breeze 
Now he's gone with the wind 
I'm in no condition to try to love again 

No, I'm in no condition to try to love again
