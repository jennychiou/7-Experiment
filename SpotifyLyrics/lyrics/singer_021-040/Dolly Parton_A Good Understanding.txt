When we married we agreed that we'd both do as we please
Just as long as we done each other right
Through the years our love has grown now our love is twice as strong
'Cause we've got a good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding and a love that has never been demanding
We both love each other so and that's all we need to know
'Cause we've got a good understanding

It's been your unselfish love that has always helped me up
When temptation reached out its hand to see
And when I could have gone wrong I would think of you at home
And I'd think about our good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding...
