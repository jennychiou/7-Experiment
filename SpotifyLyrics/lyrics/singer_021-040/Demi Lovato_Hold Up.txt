If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

It's a hold up, broken out of nowhere 
Showed up, I'm in loved
This heist, got me skipping a heart beat
I'm, giving up
I wanna run, run, run away
In your getaway car, make a getaway

If the weapon is your love I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just to leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

Hey stranger 
I'm addicted to the danger, of your touch
Now you're wanted, Better keep me as your hostage
Tie me up
I wanna run, run, run away
In your getaway car, make a getaway

If the weapon is your love I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just to leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up

Everybody get down
Get down on the floor (floor) floor (floor)
Everybody get down
Nobody gets hurt (hurt) hurt...

If the weapon is your love I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just to leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up
If the weapon is your love I got my hands up
If you're gonna take me down I surrender
I'll give you anything you want just to leave me alone
This is a hold up, this is a hold up

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
