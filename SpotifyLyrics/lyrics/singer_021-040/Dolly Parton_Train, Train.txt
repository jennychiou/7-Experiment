Gonna take him on out of this town 
Train, train 
Gonna take him on out of this town 
Yeah, that man I'm in love with 
Lord, he's Memphis bound 
He's leavin' here 
Like a raggedy old coat 
Oh, he's leavin' me 
That no good so-and-so 
Yeah, that man I'm in love with 
Lord, he wants to go 
Let him go 
Good-bye, good-bye 
I'll find myself another man 
Good-bye, good-bye 
I'll find myself another man 
You take that night train to Memphis 
Me, I'll make new plans 
Take that night train to Memphis 
Oh leave while you can
