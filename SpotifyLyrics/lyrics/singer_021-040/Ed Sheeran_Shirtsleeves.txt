I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the ocean
You made to hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes

I still taste salt water
Oh my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the ocean you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I'm on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm drowning in the ocean you made

The saltedness won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes
