There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just someone I used to know

Just someone I used to spend some time with
Just a flame that's lost its glow
But I don't tell them of the nights I cried without you 
I say just someone I used to know

Just someone I used to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them how lost I am without you
I say just someone I used to know
I say just someone I used to know
