I fought for you, I went to war in a battle of two
So many years in solitary, captured by the enemy,
I tried, I tried everything just to survive
Living a lie for someone else who
Wouldn't even save himself
What did I know, I had my eyes closed,
For what it seemed like an eternity
Those hungry eyes were prayin' on me
Didn't you know, I wanted to go
I know you saw them wanting me and now I'll
Love them dangerously

The wolves come out circling me
The hunters hunt stamping their feet
We'll play my game of hide and seek
But who will it be, who will it be... Now that I'm free
Let the wolf come and get me

I know for sure I'm ready now for so much more
I'm not gonna fight it, the temperature is rising...
I feel tonight the rhythm from the inside out
Or is it just there's someone who,
I want so bad instead of you...
He makes me feel like,
My body's alive on fire with the wonder
Reminds me I'm a lover
The pleasure and pain, is driving me insane
It's killing me to tell you this you'll hear it
And you'll know it's true

The wolves come out circling me
The hunters hunt stamping their feet
We'll play my game of hide and seek
But who will it be, who will it be... Now that I'm free
Let the wolf come and get me

Come and get, come and get, come and get me
Ooh
Come and get, come and get, come and get me

The wolves come out circling me
The hunters hunt stamping their feet
We'll play my game of hide and seek
But who will it be, who will it be... Now that I'm free, yeah
The wolves come out circling me
The hunters hunt stamping their feet
We'll play my game of hide and seek
But who will it be, who will it be... Now that I'm free
Let the wolf come and get me
