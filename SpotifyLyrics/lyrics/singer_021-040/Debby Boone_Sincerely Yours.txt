Lord, I take my pen to write to You a letter 
Knowing even now You know what's on my mind. 
But I think perhaps it might make me feel better 
If I see myself here written in a line 

But as I close I see a phrase I took for granted 
And it leaps out as I see it written there 
As the truth of it begins to become planted 
These two words have now become my heartfelt prayer 

Sincerely Yours, 
Lord, I sign myself to You 
Sincerely Yours, 
With a strong and honest wish 
To be the best that I can be at what I am 
Without a thought for me 
Lord, teach me how to be. 

Sincerely Yours, 
Without a proud or selfish line 
Sincerely Yours, 
From now until there is no time 
Please make my life become a letter you can keep 
And never throw away 
I'll write till the day I become 
Sincerely Yours
