Prepare yourself to meet
A girl who cannot sleep 
Dividing every question till
The questions are complete 
Every twisted tongue
She studies everyone 
She won't leave any stone unturned
The night is oh so young 

Oh oh
She's traveling back in time
Questioning every line
That someone said
Oh oh
She's trying to understand

Free her mind
She's always the analyst
Silent space
The culprit
The catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around in the dirt
She's a slave to the work
She's always the analyst

Can you be sure we haven't met
See the eyes
They don't forget 
They wander through the passageways
That tease a restless mind 
Can't afford to slip
The picture's gotta fit 
Her world's a photograph
That gets dissected bit by bit 

Oh oh
She's traveling back in time
Questioning every line
That someone said
Oh oh
She's trying to understand

Free her mind
She's always the analyst
Silent space
The culprit
The catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around in the dirt
She's a slave to the work
She's always the analyst

She's always the analyst
Oh oh

Reliving
The mistake she's made
Not a moment for
The curious girl

Free her mind
She's always the analyst
Silent space
The culprit
The catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around
Breaking it down 
Neurotic thoughts 
Burning the ground 
Every sight
Every sound 
She's always the analyst
