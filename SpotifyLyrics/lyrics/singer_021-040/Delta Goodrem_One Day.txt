One day I'll learn to like myself
One day I'll fight to get it right
And I'll try till time catches up with me
One day I'll be too old to care

One day
I said - one day it will be OK

One day I'll speak some Japanese
One day I'll learn to play guitar
And I'll stop procrastinating and get up off this chair
One day is always one day late

One day
One day it will be OK
I said - one day it will be OK

So I get up and try it again
So I kick myself up and I say - one day it will be OK

One day my heart will find a friend
One day I'll make the perfect whife
And I'll change my name just for him
I love these things I'll do one day

One day it will be OK
I said - one day it will be OK

So I get up and try it again
So I kick myself up and I say - one day it will be OK

One day gonna be OK, everybody's gonna be OK
