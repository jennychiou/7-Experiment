You packed in the morning 
I stared out the window 
And I struggled for something to say 
You left in the rain without closing the door 
I didn't stand in your way 
Now I miss you more 
Than I missed you before 
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows 
'Cause you left me 
Just when I needed you most 
Yes, you left me 
Just when I needed you most 
Now most every morning 
I stare out the window 
I think about where you might be 
I've written you letters that I'd like to send 
If you would just send one to me 

'Cause I need you more 
Than I needed before 
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows 
'Cause you left me 
Just when I needed you most 
Yes, you left me 
Just when I needed you most 

You packed in the morning 
I stared out the window 
And I struggled for something to say 
You left in the rain without closing the door 
I didn't stand in your way 

Now I love you more 
Than I loved you before 
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows 
'Cause you left me 
Just when I needed you most 
You left me 
Just when I needed you most 
Oh, you left me 
Just when I needed you most
