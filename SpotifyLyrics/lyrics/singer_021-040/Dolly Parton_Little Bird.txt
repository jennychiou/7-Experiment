Beauty is a rare perfume 
Precious, yet doesn't last long 
Youth is but a playful breeze 
That blows our way once then moves on 
Love is a hidden treasure 
Some never find where it lies 
And memory is a little bird 
Flies through life, live or dies 

Little bird 
Take me aboard your beautiful wings and let me fly 
Fly me away back to yesterday 
And drop me off there awhile 

Let me smell the rare perfume of the sweet flower of beauty again 
Let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind 
Let me sit for awhile by the place where I found the treasure of love 
Then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above
