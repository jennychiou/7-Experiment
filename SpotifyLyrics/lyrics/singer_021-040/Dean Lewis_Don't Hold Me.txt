Have you ever wished you could rewind?
And pick up all the pieces of a life you left behind
Have you ever lived on borrowed time?
Knowing your mistakes are chasing you down from behind

But don't hold me, 'cause I am falling back down
And I wouldn't wanna see you hit the ground
Little darling, you found my heart in the lost-and-found
But the scars, they still follow me around

I know it's hard to replace
But the feelings that you had for me, will one day be erased
And you will learn to move on
Like footprints in the snow will last when the winter's gone

But don't hold me, 'cause I am falling back down
And I wouldn't wanna see you hit the ground
Little darling, you found my heart in the lost-and-found
But the scars, they still follow me around

And the dark surrounds your heart and you're in free-fall
Oh, you must let go of me
'Cause if you keep me you will lose it all
So darling, darling please, please

Don't hold me, 'cause I am falling back down
And I wouldn't wanna see you hit the ground
Little darling, you found my heart in the lost-and-found
But the scars, they still follow me around

They follow me around
No, oh, oh-oh
They follow me around
