They used to tell me I weren't smart enough
Said I'd never make it, I don't resemble the stars enough
Man I'm just tryna get my heart to pump
Gave my all every time, I guess my all wasn't enough
They said I talk too much, didn't talk enough
Told me I should change but never said what I should change into
Man I'm just tryna play the game witchu
When you gonna see, I'm just me, I ain't the same as you

I just wanna give my all, the rise and fall, the works
I just wanna leave my mark upon your heart, a word

What do I gotta say
How do I gotta brave
What do I gotta do
Tell me who do I gotta be
What do you want from me
What do I gotta prove
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you
Tell me what do I gotta give
How do I gotta live
When it's not enough for you
It's not enough for you

Well my first mistake was tryna please everybody
Only to realise that I ain't need anybody
But all I ever wanted was acceptance
Till I accpeted myself, now I can check that off my checklist
I am no longer checking for your guest list
Or where I land on your best list
I look in my reflection and it tells me who the best is
So I could never do it like the rest did

I just wanna give my all, the rise and fall, the works
I just wanna leave my mark upon your heart, a word

What do I gotta say
How do I gotta brave
What do I gotta do
Tell me who do I gotta be
What do you want from me
What do I gotta prove
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you
Tell me what do I gotta give
How do I gotta live
When it's not enough for you
When it's not enough for you

I know they wanna see me break
I know they'd rather see me fall
And that's the very reason why
Ima rise above it all
They used to say I wasn't strong
Said I wasn't going very far
Well now I'm shining like a star
And I'm screening all my calls
Could you call me back tomorrow

What do I gotta say
How do I gotta brave
What do I gotta do
Tell me who do I gotta be
What do you want from me
What do I gotta prove
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you
Tell me what do I gotta give
How do I gotta live
When it's not enough for you
What do I gotta say
How do I gotta brave
What do I gotta do
Tell me who do I gotta be
What do you want from me
What do I gotta prove
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you
Tell me what do I gotta give
How do I gotta live
When it's not enough for you
When it's not enough for you
It's not enough for you
When it's not enough for you
When it's not enough for you
