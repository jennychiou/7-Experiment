I'm doin' fine now 
I never cry now 
In fact, I feel no pain at all 

You sound the same now 
How's what's-her-name now? 
I'm just surprised that you would call 

It took a long time, a long time 
But I was only wounded by your love 
I was only wounded, I can fall in love again 

I'm all in place now 
A quieter space now 
There's not so many highs or lows 
No more confusion 
Or grand illusion 
I just sat back and watch them go 

It took a long time, such a long time 
But I was only wounded by your love 
I was only wounded I can fall in love again 

I don't think that we can just be friends 
Maybe this is how the whole thing ends 
'Cause you'll only shoot me dead again 
I was only wounded by your love 
I was only wounded I can fall in love again 

I'm doin' fine now 
I never cry now 
In fact, I feel no pain at all
