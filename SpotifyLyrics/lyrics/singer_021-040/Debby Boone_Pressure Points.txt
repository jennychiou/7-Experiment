Lyin' here, shakin' in my bed 
Wondering why this static in my soul 
Back and forth, I need a revelation 
On the edge and wonderin' where to go 
Well I'm fallin' out, fallin' out of touch now 
Should have spent more time before the Lord 
Overnight, suddenly I'm ready to listen 

Started back, several months ago 
Sliding by on a spiritual glaze 
I was blind, I didn't see it coming 
Unprepared, I lost it in the maze 
Well I've fallen in, fallen in the trap now 
Should have taken action long before 
Should have been at His feet 
Where He said we should meet 
Resisting defeat 

Those pressure points 
Everybody has 
Those pressure points 
And when the pressure's on it points to where your weakness lies 

Now I see, it happens every day 
Wastin' time I really can't afford 
Danger signs, a creeping independence 
Takes away from leaning on the Lord 
Well I've fallen off, fallen off the main line 
Need a fresh awakening in my soul 
I can never depend 
On yesterday's win 
To carry me in 

Those pressure points 
Everybody has 
Those pressure points 
And when the pressure's on it points to where your weakness lies 
Pressure points 
Everybody has 
Those pressure points 
And when prepared you'll watch your victory rise 

Just because you're riding high 
Won't mean you always will 
The danger comes when you are standing still 
Those pressure points 

Lyin' here, shakin' in my bed 
Wondering why this static in my soul 
Back and forth, I need a revelation 
On the edge and wonderin' where to go 
Well I've fallen off, fallen off the main line 
Need a fresh awakening in my soul 
I can never depend 
On yesterday's win 
To carry me in 

Those pressure points 
Everybody has 
Those pressure points 
And when the pressure's on it points to where your weakness lies 
Pressure points 
Everybody has 
Those pressure points 
And when prepared you'll watch your victory rise
