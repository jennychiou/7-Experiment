Our love runs deep like a chevy
If you fall I'll fall with you baby
'Cause that's the way we like to do it
That's the way we like

You run around open doors like a gentleman
And tell me girl every day you're my everything
'Cause that's the way you like to do it
That's the way you like

Just a little west coast and a bit of sunshine
Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time
Just you and I
Just you and I
Whoa oh

No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know
I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way

No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
'Cause our love was made
Made in the USA

Made in the USA
Yeah

You always read my mind like a letter
When I'm cold you're there like a sweater
'Cause that's the way we like to do it
That's the way we like

I'll never ever let the world get the best of you
Every night we're apart, I'm still next to you
'Cause that's the way I like to do it
That's the way I like

We touch down on the east coast
Dinner in the sky rise
Winter is the best time
For walking in the city lights
You and I
You and I
Whoa oh

No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know
I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way

No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
'Cause our love was made
Made in the USA

'Cause baby I'll bite the bullet
Take the blows for love
Whoa oh oh

Our love was made in the USA
Made in the USA
Made in the USA

No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know
I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way

No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
'Cause our love was made
Made in the USA

Made in the USA
Yeah

Made in the US
Made in the US
Made in the USA
