You make me act like a fool
You treat me mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Why do you make me act like a fool?

Now that you know just how much I care
You treat me mean and it ain't right nor fair
I keep holdin' on though I don't know what to
While you make me act like a fool

You know just how to hurt me and you often do
When we're out in public I start fightin' with you
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh, then you go away smellin' just like a rose

Though you make me act like a fool
You treat me mean cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh, why must you make me act like a fool?

You know just how to hurt me as you often do
You start flirtin' in public with somebody new
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh then you go away smellin' just like a rose

Though you make me act like a fool
You treat mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh but why do you make, oh why do I let you
Make me look like a fool?
