Can you hear the sound of the silence
(Hush hush now)
The spotlight's fading away
Like a serenade of the quiet
(Drown it out)
The choir leaving the stage

Every time you took my breath away
(I lost something inside)
Every time you threw me a bouquet
(All the roses, they died)
So I think it's time you walk away
(The show is closing tonight)
I think it's time you walk away, way, way

And don't came back for the encore, the encore
Don't come back like you want more, you want more
Can't you see that the curtain is closed
And you can't cut me open no more
Don't come back for the applause, the applause
'Cause I'm already long gone, I'm long gone
Can't you see that she show is all over
Confetti all over the floor
But don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore

Can you hear the beat of my heart go
(Boom boom boom)
But it's not beating for you
Like a symphony in the dark
We lost our tune
Don't you think our time is through

Every time you took my breath away
(I lost something inside)
Every time you threw me a bouquet
(All the roses, they died)
So I think it's time you walk away
(The show is closing tonight)
Yeah I think it's time you walk away, way, way

And don't came back for the encore, the encore
Don't come back like you want more, you want more
Can't you see that the curtain is closed
And you can't cut me open no more
(No more)
Don't come back for the applause, the applause
'Cause I'm already long gone, I'm long gone
Can't you see that she show is all over
Confetti all over the floor
(The floor)
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore

Can you hear the sound of the silence
Hush hush now
Hush hush now

And don't came back for the encore, the encore
Don't come back like you want more, you want more
Can't you see that the curtain is closed
And you can't cut me open no more
(No more)
Don't come back for the applause, the applause
'Cause I'm already long gone, I'm long gone
Can't you see that she show is all over
Confetti all over the floor
(The floor)
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
