(Go)

I call you too much
You never pick up
Except when you wanna fuck
And I can't get enough
You're the man of my dreams
'Cause you know how to leave
But I really believe that you'd change it for me

You're unavailable
(You're unavailable)
I'm insatiable

Lucky for you, I got all these daddy issues
What can I do?
I'm going crazy when I'm with you
Forget all the therapy that I've been through
Lucky for you
I got all these daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)
Daddy issues (daddy issues, uh)

Don't know how to commit
But I might want your kid
And after our first kiss
Got your name on my wrist
Yeah, I get a little obsessive
A little aggressive, a little bit too invested
And whatever you want, whenever you want
That's what you get 'cause

You're unavailable
(You're unavailable)
I'm insatiable

Lucky for you
I got all these daddy issues
What can I do?
I'm going crazy when I'm with you
Forget all the therapy that I've been through
Lucky for you, I got all these daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)
Daddy issues
(Daddy issues, uh)

Never enough
Addicted to love with the wrong one

Lucky for you, I got all these daddy issues
What can I do?
I'm going crazy when I'm with you
Forget all the therapy that I've been through
Lucky for you, I got all these daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)
Daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)
Daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)
Daddy issues, daddy issues
