Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you 
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in two 
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal 
Just try being lonely, then you'll know just how I feel 
I saw you with your new love and oh it hurt me so 
Funny how I see your face everywhere I go 
You smiled and looked to be so happy as you passed by 
So I hurried around the corner so you wouldn't see me cry 

Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you 
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in too 
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal 
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel 
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel
