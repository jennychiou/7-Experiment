When it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do 
When it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to 
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you 
And they always put you to the test 
And you always try to do your best 
And just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family 
Some are preachers, some are gay 
Some are addicts, drunks and strays 
But not a one is turned away, when it's family 
Some are lucky, others ain't 
Some are fighters, others faint 
Winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family 

And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door 
When it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for 
When it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more 
Somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way 
To solve the problems day to day, in the family 

You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone 
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family 
You choose your lovers, you pick your friends 
Not the family that you're in, nah 
They'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family 

And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do 
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you 
When it's family, when it's family 
Let me be all that I should be to the family
