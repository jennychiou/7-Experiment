Darling it's not really over, it just seems to be
Darling I don't really think that we want to be free
A raging storm of anger made us want to end it all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall

These tiny drops of pain that's fallen down our face
Tomorrow will be gone almost without a trace
It's hurtin' now but soon we'll find it doesn't hurt at all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall

In each love some pain must fall
That doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone
Everything will be alright again
And the hurt that seems so big now
Tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall

In each love some pain must fall
That doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone
Everything will be alright again
And the hurt that seems so big now
Tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
