When you're alone and life is making you lonely 
You can always go downtown 
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry 
Seems to help, I know, downtown 
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city 
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty 
How can you lose? 
The lights are much brighter there 
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares 

And go downtown 
Things'll be great when you're downtown 
No finer place for sure, downtown 
Everything's waiting for you 

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you 
There are movie shows, downtown 
Or maybe you know some little places to go to 
Where they never close, downtown 

Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin' 
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin' 
Happy again 
The lights are much brighter there 
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares 

And go downtown 
Where all the lights are bright, downtown 
Waiting for you tonight, downtown 
You're gonna be alright now 

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you 
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along 
So maybe I'll see you there 
You can forget all your troubles 
Just forget all your cares 

And go downtown 
Things'll be great when you're downtown 
Don't wait a minute more, downtown 
Everything's waiting for you 

Downtown, where all the lights are bright 
Downtown, waiting for you tonight 
Downtown, you're going to be alright now 
Get on, get on, get on downtown 

Downtown, where all the lights are bright 
Downtown, waiting for you tonight 
Downtown, you're going to be alright now 
Get on, get on, get on downtown
