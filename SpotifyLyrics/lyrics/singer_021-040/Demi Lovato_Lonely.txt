He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit though I'll admit that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

You know me, and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely, and you didn't want me
Trying to show me that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me, fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no goddamn reason, but all you do is leave me
Fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

The month was June
The smoky sun, our fatal run
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

You know me, and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely, and you didn't want me
Trying to show me that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me, fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no goddamn reason, but all you do is leave me
Fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

Bitch can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me to breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart, and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause love birds are some busy bees
You fuck around, you stung again
And you didn't leave in your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look baby, either love is blind or nothing's there because
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke forests full of weed, and call you when I see you
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves, I'm fucking lonely

"'Demi Lovato"'
Lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
