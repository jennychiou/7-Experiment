No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough

If there were just the two of us how different things would be
No one could come between us from now on
The wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of gossip gone
Without a prying ear to fall upon

No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
Though we have no power over those around us
We can act as if there's just the two of us

Though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy sea
I'll only draw you nearer onto me
As long as we're together we'll never walk alone
We'll build a world of sunshine of our own

No we can't control the evil that surround us...
