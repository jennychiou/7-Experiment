The midsummer sun shines but dim
The fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him
December was pleasant as May

There once was a time he and I
Picked flowers to braid in my hair
And the songbirds would sing a sweet song
Of love that was tender and fair

No difference did seasons make when
Our love was as warm as the sun
And it mattered not whether the snow
Or the green grass kissed the fields where we'd run

Now the midsummer sun shines but dim
The fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him
December was pleasant as May

Sweet flowers, sweet birds and sweet songs
Have now lost their sweetness to me
Forever my darling is gone
And forever heartbroken are we

Now the midsummer sun shines but dim
The fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him
December was pleasant as May

The midsummer sun shines but dim
