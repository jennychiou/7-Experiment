Oh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your love'll set me free
Your love'll set me free
I'll keep holding on to love that used to be cause there's still a lot of you left in me

Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we used to see
Oh but I'm thinkin' now I'm just not the same without you
And that there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you...
Cause there's still a lot of you left in me
