Two little children a boy and a girl 
Sat by and old church door 
The little girls feet were as brown as the curl 
That fell on the dress that she wore 

The little boys clothes were all tattered and torn 
They shone beneath his blue eyes 
Why don't you go home to your mommy I said 
And this was the maidens reply 

Mommy's is heaven angels took her away 
Left Jim and I all alone 
We've no one to love us daddy is dead 
And our darling mother is gone 

Mommy got sick angels took her away 
To dwell in those matins so bright 
She said she would come for her children someday 
And I guess she's coming tonight 

The sexton came early to ring the church bell 
And found them beneath the snow white 
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell 
Up in heaven with their mommy that night
