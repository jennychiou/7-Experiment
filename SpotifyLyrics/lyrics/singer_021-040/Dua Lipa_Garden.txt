Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?

Used to walk around your apartment
With nothing, but a smile on me
But tonight, I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in paradise
Don't know what it's worth till you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
