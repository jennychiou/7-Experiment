I couldn't wait forever 
Did you expect me to 
I guess you thought I'd never 
Find somebody new 
I lived on dreams and promises 
As long as I could 
I couldn't wait forever 
The way you thought I would 
The lonely nights grew longer 
As I prayed for time to fly 
I lived on hopes that you'd return 
And that's how I got by 
The agony of loneliness 
Just got too much for me 
I couldn't wait forever 
Needing love so desperately 

So I found new lips to kiss me 
New arms to hold me tight 
I found new love and happiness 
To fill these empty nights 
You took my love for granted 
Now my heart has found a new home 
I couldn't wait forever 
Forever's just too long 
I couldn't wait forever 
Forever's just too long
