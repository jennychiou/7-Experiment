You like to mix with people 
I like to be alone 
Baby you could stay out all night 
I'd just as well stay home 
Too people with so little in common 
And different as we can be 
We come together around midnight 
When it's just you and me 

When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us 
But our own sweet love 
When it's time to be tender and try to remember 
What we're doin' here 
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind 
Just so we agree 
Sometime 'round midnight 
When it's just you and me 

You love to hear the music 
You get up and dance around 
Baby, you can act so crazy, you turn it up way too loud 
Oh, I've got my share of hang-ups 
But you never seem to see 
And we get together 'round midnight 
When it's just you and me 

When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us 
But our own sweet love 
When it's time to be tender and try to remember 
What we're doin' here 
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind 
Just so we agree 
Sometime 'round midnight 
When it's just you and me 

Sometime 'round midnight 
When it's just you and me
