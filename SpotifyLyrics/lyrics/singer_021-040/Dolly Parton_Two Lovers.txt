Well I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed 
Two lovers and I love them both the same 
Let me tell you 'bout my first lover 
He's sweet and kind, he's mine all mine 
He treats me good like a lover should 
And makes me love him 
I really really love him 
Oh oh oh oh I love him so 
And I'll do everything I can 
To let him know 

But I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed 
Two lovers and I love them both the same 

Let me tell you 'bout my other lover 
You know he treats me bad, he makes me sad 
He makes me cry but still I can't deny 
That I love him 
I really really love him 
Oh oh oh oh I love him so 
And I'll do everything I can 
To let him know 

Oh but darling, well, 
Don't you know that I can tell 
Whenever I look at you 
That you think that I'm untrue 
'Cause I said that I love two 
But I really really do 

'Cause you're a split personality 
And in reality 
Both of them are you 

But I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed 
Two lovers and I love them both the same 
I've got two lovers but I ain't ashamed 
'Cause both of them are you 
I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed, no 
Two lovers and I love them both the same 
I've got two lovers, two lovers 
And both of them are you
