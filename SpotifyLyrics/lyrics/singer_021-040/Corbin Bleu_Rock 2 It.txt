Rock to it, rock to it

Don't let the nice guy image fool ya
See there's a lotta things that you didn't know
What I'm about to do might be peculiar
I tend to lose it when I step on the floor

This is for the bad girls
Let me see what you can do
Sexy and single
Just lose your mind to the groove

All around the world
Here's what I want you to do
Just go crazy, don't quit
Let me see you break a sweat

Rock to it, rock to it
Head bangin', body shakin', just lose it
Rock to it, rock to it
Act like a rock star, just lose it

Don't let my laid back style get ya twisted
I got another side that you never seen
Can't stand up on the wall and just listen
I gotta rock, rock, rock to the beat

This is for the fellas
Let me see what you can do
Just grab somebody
Just lose your mind to the groove

And never let her go
Here's what I want you to do
Just go crazy, don't quit
Show them girls what time it is

Rock to it, rock to it
Head bangin', body shakin', just lose it
Rock to it, rock to it
Act like a rock star, just lose it

This is for the bad girls
Let me see what you can do
Sexy and single
Just lose your mind to the groove

All around the world
Here's what I want you to do
Just go crazy, don't quit
Let me see you break a sweat

Rock to it, rock to it
Head bangin', body shakin', just lose it
Rock to it, rock to it
Act like a rock star, just lose it

Rock to it, rock to it
Head bangin', body shakin', just lose it
Rock to it, rock to it
Act like a rock star, just lose it

Act like a rock star, just lose it
Act like a rock star, just lose it
Act like a rock star, just lose it
