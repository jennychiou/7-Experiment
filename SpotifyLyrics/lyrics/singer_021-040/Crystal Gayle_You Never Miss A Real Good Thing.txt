Sitting on my bed a-thinking
Thinking that my heart is sinking
Every day the world goes by
With you gone

All I do is dream about you
Living ain't a life without you
Honey, can you find it in you 
To come back home

You never miss a real good thing
Or know what it means
You never see the light of day
Till it goes away
You never want a drink of water
Till the well runs dry
You never miss a real good thing
Till he says goodbye

I guess you must have had your reasons
Maybe you were right in leaving
I know you never found yourself
In what we had

And, honey, you've a right to blame me
Maybe even time would change me
But can't you see the good that's in me
And overlook the bad

You never miss a real good thing
Or know what it means
You never see the light of day
Till it goes away
You never want a drink of water
Till the well runs dry
You never miss a real good thing
Till he says goodbye

You never miss a real good thing
Or know what it means
You never see the light of day
Till it goes away
You never want a drink of water
Till the well runs dry
You never miss a real good thing
Till he says goodbye
