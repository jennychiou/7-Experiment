We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
And quenched our thirst with rain
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me

Well the winter came and the snow did fall
And the night was cold and still
And the rags we wore were not enough
And Joe he caught the chill
And he told me how he loved me
And in my arms he went to sleep
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me

While standin' here on the edge of this bridge
Lookin' down I see
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me
Tonight we'll be together again
Gypsy, Joe and me
