The Sierra Mountains rise up
As you float down into L.A.
The Pacific roars hello
It's another surfin' day

Everyone out here is pretty
Someone's bound to steal your heart away
And you'll find you wanna stay

In California, where the sun is warm
Where the winds called Santa Ana
Make you feel like you belong
California, wherever you may roam
California keeps calling you home

All the boulevards and back roads
And the brights lights of Hollywood
And the laid-back way of living
Makes you feel all kinds of good

I could meet you at sunrise
We could swim in the ocean blue
And I might just say to you
Hey, it's true, I love you

So come on to California
Where the sun is warm
Where the winds called Santa Ana
Make you feel like you belong
California, wherever you may roam
California keeps calling you home

So come on to California
Where the sun is warm
Where the winds called Santa Ana
Make you feel like you belong
California, wherever you may roam
California keeps calling you home

So come on to California
Where the sun is warm
Where the winds called Santa Ana
Make you feel like you belong
