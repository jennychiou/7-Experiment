I can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind 
Just the way it use to sound through the Georgia pines 
You were always there to answer when I'd call 
You and me, we had it all 
Remember how I use to touch your hair 
Reaching for the feeling that was always there 
You were the best thing in my life, I can recall 
You and me, we had it all 

I know that we can never live those times again 
But I let my dreams take me back to where we've been 
And I stay there with you just as long as I can 
Oh it was so good 
It was so good 
It was so good when you were my man 

But I'll never stop believing in your smile 
Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while 
You were the best thing in my life I can recall 
You and me, we had it all 

I know that we could never get that far again 
So I let these memories take me on back to where we've been 
And I stay there with you just as long as I can 
Oh it was so good, it really was 
It was so good, oh oh 
It was so good when you were my man 

You were the best thing in my life I can recall 
You and me, we had it all
