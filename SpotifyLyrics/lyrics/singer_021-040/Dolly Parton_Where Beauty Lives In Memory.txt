She stands before the mirror
Smiles at her reflection
Striking sexy poses in the glass
She paints her lips a brilliant red
Piles her hair high on her head
Struggles to replace a false eyelash

She powders up her face
Paints her cheeks to match her lips
She wears a dress cut low in the front
Fittin' tight around her hips
And there inside her room
She stands and gazes at herself
Where beauty lives in memory
She lives in fairy tales

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore

She was a fairy princess once
And was by all adored
They say she was the fairest of them all
They called her Cinderella
And they say that every fella
Would gladly answer to her beck and call

So the story went
They tell of how this handsome prince
Stole her heart and wandered far away
He took her heart and took her mind
Now she has lost all track of time
Forty years has passed and still she waits singing

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore

Meanwhile back inside her room
The shads are pulled it's half past noon
But in her mind why it's forty years ago
She recalls the beauty of their love
She remembers he was beautiful
And of course she always knew she was

And so the past unfolds
And all at once inside her mind
She sees him at the door
And as he's leading her away
She feels the room begin to sway
Where beauty lives in memory
She falls dead upon the floor

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
