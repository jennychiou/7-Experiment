Got something on the menu
Don't spoil your appetite, oh you better make room
'Cause tonight we gonna celebrate
Yeah baby all day longer than marinade
Turned up to just the right temperature
Yeah baby trust me this is better than your regular
Stressed up, I got the perfect remedy
Just step up, I got the perfect recipe

Hot stuff, just enough
Stir it up, heat tonight and quit tomorrow
Your turn, work, work
Burn, burn
Too hot down low, can't take the heat
Get out the kitchen
It's getting too hot
You better get out the kitchen

Let me sprinkle a little yeah for me something to drizzle you
For me right in the middle 'cause I be killing them
Testing, right she know that I be sipping them
Watch them hips she know that I be dipping them
We can mix it up, we can stitch it up
But we gonna heat it just right before we serve it up
And if it gets too hot for you
Don't worry baby I'ma come and get the door for you

Hot stuff, just enough
Stir it up, heat tonight and quit tomorrow
Your turn, work, work
Burn, burn
Too hot down low, can't take the heat
Get out the kitchen

You better get out the kitchen
