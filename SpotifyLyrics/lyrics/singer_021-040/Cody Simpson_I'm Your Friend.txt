When you're down and you can't call upon your mama no more
You can call, you can call on me
When you're low, we'll get high and dip our toes down in the ties
Cause no one's there to tell us "Come inside"

And I know you believe in angels
And you know I believe in you

And I know everybody goes through changes
But that just means we're all the same
All best friends start out as strangers
So rest easy 'cause I'm your friend

And you're lost and you can't find your way out of the trees
I will see the signal you set into the breeze
You know me well
I will rescue thee

And I know you believe in lucky chance
That you know I mediate under the circumstance

And I know everybody goes through changes
But that just means we're all the same
All best friends start out as strangers
So rest easy 'cause I'm your friend

Sometimes when the sun is out, the rain is really pouring down
If you don't wanna think about it, build up all the float around it
We are all the architects of everything that's coming next
Together we can build a bridge and walk away from all of this

When you're down and you can't call upon your mama anymore
