"'Demi Lovato:"'
Oh, oh, yeah

Remember love? Remember you and me?
Remember everything we shared on this planet when we cared?
Remember hearts? Remember unity?
Remember loving neighbors without expecting favors?

Why be afraid to make an honest mistake?
If you acknowledge the pain, and you wanna change
You can get through anything

Do you remember at all?
People walking hand in hand, can we feel that love again?
Can you imagine it all?
If we all could get along, then we all could sing this song together
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Singing, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

"'Jason Derulo:"'
Look at me, look at you
Now look at me again, see, we're not so different
Look around, what do you see?
We're throwing things outside our window, we don't care to keep it clean

I had a dream, beauty was only skin deep
And if we all just believe, that it's all we need
Nothing else can set you free

"'Demi Lovato (Jason Derulo):"'
Do you remember at all? (At all?)
People walking hand in hand (Hand in hand)
Can we feel that love again? (Can we feel it again?)
Can you imagine it all? (Imagine it all?)
If we all could get along, then we all could
("'And Jason Derulo:"' Sing this song together)
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Singing, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Ooh yeah)

If we could throw away the hate and make love last another day
Don't give up just for today, life would be so simple

"'Jason Derulo:"'
And they may talk about us but they will never stop us

"'Demi Lovato and Jason Derulo:"'
We'll keep singing

"'Demi Lovato:"'
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

"'Demi Lovato and Jason Derulo:"'
Come on, we'll keep singing

"'Demi Lovato (Jason Derulo):"'
Singing, oh oh oh oh (Whoa yeah), oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh yeah)

Do you remember at all?
People walking hand in hand (Walking hand in hand, whoa)
Can we feel that love again?
Can you imagine it all?
If we all could get along, then we all could sing this song together

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Come on, come on, come on
Singing, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Come on, come on, come on)
Hold your hand of your neighbor, together, together
Singing, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(No, no, no, no) Come on, singing with me
Singing, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Now, can you see it, baby?) Oh
