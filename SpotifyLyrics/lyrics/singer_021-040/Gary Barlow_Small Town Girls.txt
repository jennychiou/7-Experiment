Small town girls live life sweetly
They don't waste time dreaming of opportunity
Small town girls learn quickly
They live for who they are not who they wanna be

Upon the greenest grass they laugh and grow
The man who makes the boundaries no one knows

Small town girls they make the whole world turn
Don't get their fingers burned quite as easy as the rest, oh oh
Small town girls they make my heart collapse
Such a shame the Bible never said that
The foundations of the world, they are built on small town girls

Small town girls stop at nothing
They take no prisoners, never try small talking
And what they have is quite unique
Their hearts are big enough to wear on their sleeves

Upon the greenest grass they laugh and grow
The man who makes the boundaries no one knows

Small town girls they make the whole world turn
Don't get their fingers burned quite as easy as the rest, oh oh
Small town girls they make my heart collapse
Such a shame the Bible never said that
The foundations of the world, they are built on small town girls

Everybody knows they're quite a chase
When everybody looks they hide their face

Small town girls are innocent
With rosy cheeks and grassy knees their life is heaven sent
Most girls marry young and have some kids
But who am I to tell them what they've missed

Small town girls they make the whole world turn
Don't get their fingers burned quite as easy as the rest, oh oh
Small town girls they make my heart collapse
Such a shame the Bible never said that
The foundations of the world, they are built on small town girls
