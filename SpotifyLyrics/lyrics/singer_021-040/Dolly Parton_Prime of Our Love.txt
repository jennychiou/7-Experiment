I have rocked you to sleep like a baby
Stood beneath you and lifted you up
I have given you comfort and safety
Now you've gone in the prime of our love

I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love

Oh, the days are slow in their passing
And the nights are so dreadfully dull
And the question my heart keeps on asking
Why'd you leave in the prime of our love?

I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love

In the prime of our love you've forsaken
Our bright hopes and just left them to fade
And the heart that was yours for the breaking
Lies in pieces to wither away

I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love

In the prime of our love you've forsaken
Our bright hopes and just left them to fade
And the heart that was yours for the breaking
Lies in pieces to wither away
Lies in pieces as cold as the clay
