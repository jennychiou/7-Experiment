We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
We got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die

Whatcha try'n to tell me, boy?
Whatcha try'n to do to me?
You know you're my pride and joy
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Around you my world revolves
It's a problem we can solve
Can it really be so involved we can't work it out?
We'll work it out

'Cause we got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die

Won't you talk to me tonight?
Let me hold you and love you right
Nobody's gonna know those eyes
The way I do, I do know you
Maybe she's your fantasy
She can't love you more than me
Just touch me and you will see
You're forever mine, forever mine

'Cause we got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die

Tell me what it is you want, what it is you need
What it is that I ain't that I should be
I'll play your games, I'll be your fool
If you want me to learn, then take me to school
Maybe I'll show you

We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die

Yeah we got too much, we got too much
We got too much, we got too much
We got too much, we got too much
We got too much, got too much to let it die

We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die
