Many years you have lingered around my cabin door 
Oh hard times come again no more 
Oh hard times come again no more 
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away 
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake 
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend 
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen 

So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more 
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for 
There's a wolf at the door with an angry 
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times 
And the cupboard is bare 

Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest 
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress 
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear 
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair 

So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more 
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for 
There's a wolf at the door with an angry 
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times 
And the cupboard is bare 

So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more 
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for 
There's a wolf at the door with an angry 
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times 
And the cupboard is bare 

Hush a bye hard times go ye away 
I don't intend to be treated this way 

So, hush a bye baby 
Hush a bye hard times 
Hush a bye baby 
Don't cry no more 
Hush a bye hard times 
Hush a bye baby 
Hush a bye hard times 
Come ye no more 

Many years you have lingered around my cabin door 
Hush a bye hard times 
Come ye no more 
Hush a bye baby 
Hush a bye hard times 
Hush a bye baby 
Don't cry no more 
Hush a bye hard times 
Hush a bye baby 
Hush a bye hard times 
Come ye no more
