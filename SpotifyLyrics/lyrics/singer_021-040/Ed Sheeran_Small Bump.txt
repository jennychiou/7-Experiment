You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes

I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months you're brought to life

And I'll whisper quietly
And give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only, you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

You're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon open wide
A small bump, in four months
You'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
And tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

Then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet
When you're half asleep I'll leave you be
Right in front of me, for a couple weeks
So I could keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months, then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why
