All my life I've waited for an angel
But no angel ever came along.
Then one happy afternoon I met you.
And my heart began to sing a song.
Somehow I mistook you for an angel
But now I'm glad that I was wrong.

You may not be an angel
Cause angels are so few,
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you.
I'm looking for an angel
Who'll sing my love song too,
And until the day that one comes along
I'll sing my song for you.

For every little fault that you've had, 
Say, I've got three or four.
The human and little faults you do have
Just make me love you more.

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure you'll do.
So until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you.

For every little fault that you have,
Say I've got three or four.
The human little faults that you do have honey,
Just make me love you more.

You may not be an angel,
But still I'm sure you'll do.
So until the day that one comes along, 
I'll string along with you.
