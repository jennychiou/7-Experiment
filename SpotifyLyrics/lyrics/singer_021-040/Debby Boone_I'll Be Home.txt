I'll be home, I'll be home 
When your nights are troubled 
And you're all alone 
When you're feeling down 
And need some sympathy 
Nobody's around 
To keep you company 
Remember, baby, you can always count on me 

I'll be home 
I'll be home 
I'll be home 

I'll be home 
Wherever you may wander 
Wherever you may roam 
You'll come back 
And I'll be waiting here for you 
No one else will ever love you the way I do 
I'll be here to comfort you 
And see you through 

I'll be home 
I'll be home 
I'll be home
