Yes, you're known by the company you keep
You say you're doin' nothing wrong
I don't believe you are
I'm only trying to help you sis
Before you go too far
'Cause I think you're an angel
But folks think that you're cheap
'Cause you're known by the company you keep

Please listen to your big sister
I feel I know what's best for you
I feel that I must warn you sis
That's the least that I could do
I'm not accusing you of anything
I know it's fun you see
But you're known by the company you keep

The company you keep keeps you out too long
Mom and dad don't go to sleep until you get home
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
You'd better look before you leave
'Cause you're known by the company you keep

Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
The road of life is steep
And you're known by the company you keep
