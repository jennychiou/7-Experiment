You ready? Yeah, alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on

You can lie if you want but it's in your eyes
Your heart is calling for me tonight
Feeling me crazy, you can't deny
So I am coming over at the speed of light

Let me put it down, here's the scenario
I must say girl, you're incredible
I am a simple dude, and I ain't gotta have it all
Maybe one day a couple of phone calls

Now I see that you're playing your position
Real laid back, real distant
But your body seems oh so different
I can tell that I am in your system

And I know you like what you're hearing
'Cause your heavy breathing tells me
That you're feeling what I am feeling too
So there's need to play games when I know you feel the same
Baby it don't matter what you do

You can lie if you want but it's in your eyes
Your heart is calling for me tonight
Feeling me crazy, you can't deny
So I am coming over at the speed of light
Speed of light, the speed of light, the speed of light

Still on the phone, still waiting
But I am not gonna trip, I got patience
What's the problem? What's the hesitation?
I am sayin' girl can a get a date?

Now you got me on the edge of my seat girl
Got me wondering what's it gonna be girl
Let me, let me know when we're gonna meet girl
Tell me where do we go?

'Cause I know that you like what you're hearing
'Cause your heavy breathing tells me
That you're feeling what I am feeling too
So there's need to play games when I know you feel the same
Baby it don't matter what you do

You can lie if you want but it's in your eyes
Your heart is calling for me tonight
Feeling me crazy, you can't deny
So I am coming over at the speed of light
Speed of light, the speed of light, the speed of light

'Cause I know you like what you're hearing
'Cause your heavy breathing tells me
That you're feeling what I am feeling too
So there's need to play games when I know you feel the same
Baby it don't matter what you do

You can lie if you want but it's in your eyes
Your heart is calling for me tonight
Feeling me crazy, you can't deny
So I am coming over at the speed of light
Speed of light, the speed of light, the speed of light

At the speed of light, at the speed of light
At the speed of light, at the speed of light
At the speed of light, at the speed of light
At the speed of light
