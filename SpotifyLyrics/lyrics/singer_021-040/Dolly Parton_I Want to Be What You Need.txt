When you're not strong and need someone to lean on 
Let me be your strength when you're weak 
When you need somebody to comfort and love you 
Let mine be the arms that you seek 
I want to be what you need 
Whatever it is, come to me 
You'll always know where I'll be 
'Cause I want to be what you need 

When life gets to be more than you can endure 
My hand is always in reach 
And I'm always waiting, and I'm always willing 
To give you whatever you need 

I want to be what you need 
Whatever it is, come to me 
You'll always know where I'll be 
'Cause I want to be what you need 
Yes, I want to be what you need
