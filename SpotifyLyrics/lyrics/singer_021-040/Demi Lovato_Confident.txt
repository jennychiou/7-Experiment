Are you ready? Ha

It's time for me to take it, I'm a boss right now
Not gonna fake it, not when you go down
'Cause this is my game and you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back now I'm letting go
I make my own choice, bitch I run the show
So leave the lights on no you can't make me behave

(Oh oh, oh) 
So you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated (rated, rated)

(Ah ha) 
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (Ah ha)
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (Ah ha)

It's time to get the chains out
Is your tongue tied up?
'Cause this is my round and I'm dangerous
And you can get off but it's all about me tonight (tonight, ha)

(Oh oh, oh) 
So you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated (rated, rated)

(Ah ha) 
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? 
(Ah ha)
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Ah ha)
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? 
(Ah ha)
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? 
(Ah ha)

So you say I'm complicated
But you've had me underrated

(Ah ha) 
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? 
(Ah ha)
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Ah ha)
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? 
(Ah ha)
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? 
Confident
