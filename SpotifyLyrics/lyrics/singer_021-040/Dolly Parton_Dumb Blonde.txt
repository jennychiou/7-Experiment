Don't try to cry your way out of this 
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it 
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you 
Just because I'm blonde 
Don't think I'm dumb 
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool 
When you left you thought I'd sit 
An' you thought I'd wait 
An' you thought I'd cry 
You called me a dumb blonde 
Ah, but somehow I lived through it 
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned 
Blondes have more fun 

You flew too high up off the ground 
It's stormy wheater an' had to come back down 
But I've found new thread for my old spool 
Just because I'm blonde 
Don't think I'm dumb 
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool
