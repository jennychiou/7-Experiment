(Blackwell/Hammer)

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love can drive a girl insane
You broke my will oh but what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
I like that love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you move me honey
I change my mind this love is sure fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Ooh kiss me baby, ooh it feels good
Ooh hold me, hold me, I would love to love you
Like a lover should
'Cause you're fine, and so kind
I tell the world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
You broke my will but I love you still and
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Ooh kiss my baby, ooh it feels good, ooh hold me
Baby, you ought to love me like a lover should
'Cause you're fine, and so kind


I tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I love that you love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you move me honey
I change my mind, this love is sure fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Kiss me baby, ooh it feels good
Ooh hold me, hold me
You ought to love me like a lover should
'Cause you're fine and so kind
I tell the world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I sure am nervous
But I'm sure havin' fun
I change my mind, this love is sure fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, you broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
You broke my will but I love you still
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Goodness gracious great balls of fire
