These mistakes I made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasn't there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But baby I'm still your man I swear

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me

Is it too much that I'm asking for
Can we start over, can we end this war
I've been taking your love, I've been wasting your time
But is there still a chance of me changing your mind
Before you go walking out the door

Oh you know I'm not perfect
If you leave I deserve it
But baby all I'm asking you is please, please

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me

Oh you don't wanna wait another minute
You don't wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me baby
You don't wanna wait another minute
No, you don't wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me baby

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be so
Please be patient with me

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me, yeah
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be so
Please be patient with me
