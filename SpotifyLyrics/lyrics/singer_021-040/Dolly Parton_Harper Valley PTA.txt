I want to tell you all a story about a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, "Mama, I got a note here, from the Harper Valley PTA"

Well, the note says, "Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinking and running around with men and going wild
Now, we don't believe you should be bringing up your little girl this way" 
And it was signed by the Secretary of the Harper Valley PTA

Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, "I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA"

"Now, there's Bobby Taylor sitting there, and seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades off or completely down?"

"Now, Mr. Harper couldn't be here because he stayed too long at Kelley's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And you have the nerve to tell me that, as a mother, you think that I ain't fit?
Well, this is just a little patent place and you're all Harper Valley Hypocrites"

Now, I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
That day my momma socked it to 'em, at the Harper Valley PTA
