You and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant
Down the trails where fate has led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always

Together together
Together always you and me
Forever and ever
Together always you and me

Through the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I
And in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always

Together together
Together always you and me
Forever and ever
Together always you and me

Together together
Together always you and me
Forever and ever
Together always you and me

Together together...
