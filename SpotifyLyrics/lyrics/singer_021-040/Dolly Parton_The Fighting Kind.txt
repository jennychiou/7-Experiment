You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind

Oh yes you did you started it like you start all our fights
No I didn't do no such thing and let that a dirty lie
Nothin's ever your fault and nothin's ever mine
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind

Well you've burned the supper up again that's nothing new
I just figured you'd pack that all on me
Well you're the one that caused it oh it's always me
When you're always lookin' faults ain't hard to find
We delight in pickin' fights cause our love's the fightin' kind

Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything do we blame it on the other
Some love is understanding and there's careless love in line
It takes all sorts and mine and yours is known as the fightin' kind

Okay Miss Priss what is it now now I know you done this
What how am I supposed to shave that ain't never been my problem
Now I don't care about you using my razor
But did you have to use my brand new blade
New blade boy it's good that is really good
That's real good to think I went to all that trouble tryin' to fix that nice for you
That's fixed up nice I'll probably keep it for washin' the soap off the wall
Oh there ain't no soap or I ain't got no television in the bathroom
And that new blade that you begrudged me had already been used

Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything so we blame it on the other
What's mine is yours what's yours is yours and so on down the line
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
