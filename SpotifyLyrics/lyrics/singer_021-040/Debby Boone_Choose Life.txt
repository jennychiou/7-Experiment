Be careful, be careful
You could be entering the danger zone

Appeared to be a good plan at the time
Seemed so harmless, no big crime
The choice was mine and I made it
But I didn't choose life

What I wanted was all I could see
Desire dangled in front of me
I lived on the brink of destruction
'Cause I didn't choose life

While the truth comes to free you, to lift and console you
Lies will cut you deeper than a two-edged knife
When the wrong way that seems right begins to control you
Don't let bad decisions make you pay the price
Cut the power of death and choose life

Each bad choice chipped away my soul
Soon survival became my goal
I ended up splitting up pieces
'Cause I didn't choose life

The sound of judgement was hard to hear
Till the facts came in loud and clear
It's either one way or the other
And I better choose life

While the truth comes to free you, to lift and console you
Lies will cut you deeper than a two-edged knife
When the wrong way that seems right begins to control you
Don't let bad decisions make you pay the price
Cut the power of death and choose life

Life
Life
Choose life

What then will you choose?
How much must you lose?
Time is running out
No longer able to slide by on foolish moves

We're nothing more than lives of clay
Formed by choices made yesterday
It turns to mud if you let it
So you better choose life

Be sure that when you add up the score
Life's columns add up to so much more
'Cause every single thing you do counts
So you better choose life

While the truth comes to free you, to lift and console you
Lies will cut you deeper than a two-edged knife
When the wrong way that seems right begins to control you
Don't let bad decisions make you pay the price
Cut the power of death -- choose life

Choose life
Cut the power of death (choose life)

While the truth comes to free you, to lift and console you
Lies will cut you deeper than a two-edged knife (choose life)
When the wrong way that seems right begins to control you
Don't let bad decisions make you pay the price
Cut the power of death -- choose life
