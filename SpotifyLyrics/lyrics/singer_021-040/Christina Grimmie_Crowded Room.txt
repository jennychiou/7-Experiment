How many times?
How many nights?
Wasted on trying to fit in
A different dress, same old regrets
Vanity's wearing me thin
And this exposure, over and over
Who is that girl in my skin, in my skin?

Here in this crowded room
Under the pale white moon
Blinded and lost in the lights
Looking for somewhere to hide
Surrounded by faces, laughter, and voices
Alone here with everyone else
Here in this crowded room
I found everyone but myself
Ooh, yeah-yeah

I dance in the dark, hiding my cards
Don't want you to know who I am
Act like I don't care
Pretend I'm not scared
I buried my head in the sand
The hand of a stranger, makes me feel safer
Lonely but not on my own, on my own, yeah

Here in this crowded room
Under the pale white moon
Blinded and lost in the lights
Looking for somewhere to hide, yeah-yeah
Surrounded by faces, laughter, and voices
Alone here with everyone else
Here in this crowded room
I found everyone but myself

Carry on, move along
Holding on, to anyone
Get through the night, just get through the night
Walk away, never fade
Never break, stay away
Get through the night, by the end of the night
I'm still here by myself
Here in this crowded room
Under the pale white moon
Blinded and lost in the lights
Looking for somewhere to hide

Oh, here in this crowded room
Under the pale white moon
Blinded and lost in the lights
Looking for somewhere to hide
Surrounded by faces, laughter, and voices
Alone here with everyone else
Here in this crowded room
I found everyone but myself, but myself, hmm
