(Dolly Parton)

It's been one of those days 
That reminded me in many ways 
Of when we were happy, still in love 
Just a certain way the wind blows 
Just a certain way the sun glows 
It's been one of those days that reminded me of us 

And even though it's over I never will get over 
These feelings that I get on certain days 
And I know I'll always love you 
And I'll always be thinkin' of you 
In certain kinds of ways, on certain kinds of days 
And today well, it's been one of those days 

It's been one of those days and my heart feels so heavy 
And my mind is so full of thoughts of you 
It's been one of those days and I'd give my life to see you 
And to once more know the love that we once knew 

And even though it's over I never will get over 
Oh these feelings that I get on certain days 
I guess I know I'll always love you 
And I'll always be thinkin' of you 
In certain kinds of ways, on certain kinds of days 
And today well, it's been one of, one of those days 

It's been one of those days 
That reminded me in many ways 
Of when we were happy, still in love
