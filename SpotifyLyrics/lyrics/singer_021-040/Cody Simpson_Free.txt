She looks good in the morning sun
But even better with a thigh dot on
Feather in her head, flower in her hair
And I love the way that she just don't care

She got a cat that she calls Tattoo
She got herself a couple tattoos too yeah
And when she drinks you know she love a cigarette
Got a little black pearl hanging around her neck

No, she ain't one for commotion
She living just like the ocean

She just wanna be free
Just let her be
I'll take a ride on the breeze
Why can't you see?
She just wanna be cool
And doing what she do
A bad feed swaying to a laid back beat
She just wanna be free

She blowing smoke rings in my head
To collide I scope the dreams running on my bed
And I know, I know I know I know
We gonna take it slow

The kind of soul that can do no wrong
A little soul to the earth that I blew so wrong
And I know, I know I know I know
She gonna take it slow

She just wanna be free
Just let her be
I'll take a ride on the breeze
Why can't you see?
She just wanna be cool
And doing what she do
Bad feed swaying to a laid back beat
Baby doll, she just wanna be free

She like to keep it emotion, woah
She's steady flow like the ocean

Oh, she just wanna be free, so free
Just let her be
I'll take a ride on the breeze, baby please
Why can't you see?
She just wanna be cool
Doing what she do
Bad feed swaying to a laid back beat
She just wanna be free
