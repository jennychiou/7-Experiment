I feel a separation coming on 
'Cause I know you want to be moving on
I wish it would snow tonight 
You pull me in, avoid a fight 
'Cause I feel a separation coming on 

Just prove that there is nothing left to try 
'Cause the truth that rather we just both deny
You kiss me with those open eyes 
It says so much, it's no surprise to you 
But I've got something left to say 

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender 
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then, now you're listening
To what they say, don't go that way 
Remember, remember December, please remember
Don't surrender

You said you wouldn't let them change your mind 
'Cause when we're together fire melts the ice  
Our hearts are both on overdrive 
Come with me, let's run tonight
Don't let these memories get left behind 

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December 
We were so in love back then, now you're listening
To what they say, don't go that way
Remember, remember December, please remember 

I remember us together
With a promise of forever 
We could do this, fight the pressure 
Please remember December 

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender 
Please remember, remember December 
We were so in love back then, now you're listening 
To what they say, don't go that way 
Remember, remember December, please remember 
Don't surrender
