Hold on, hold on, hold on tight
Hold on, hold on, hold on tight
Hold on to our love
Hold on to our love

How can you say you don't feel it anymore
This was the love that you never felt before
Don't you remember when I was your everything
'Cause it was, always you and me
Give it time and you will see
Oh baby please let me hold you again

(Hold on to our love) Baby hold on to me for dear life
(Hold on to our love) Baby I need your love to survive

How can I show what your love means to me
Don't ask me, I don't know how to set you free
Oh darling, stay with me, I will do anything
'Cause it was always you and me
Give it time and you will see
Begging you please let me hold you again

(Hold on to our love) Baby hold on to me for dear life
(Hold on to our love) Baby I need your love to survive
(Hold on to our love) Baby hold on to me for dear life
(Hold on to our love) Baby I need your love to survive

Hold on, hold on, hold on tight

'Cause it was always you and me
Give it time and you will see
Begging you please let me hold you again

(Hold on to our love) Baby hold on to me for dear life
(Hold on to our love) Baby I need your love to survive
(Hold on to our love) Baby hold on to me for dear life
(Hold on to our love) Baby I need your love to survive
