I don't even like you,
Why'd you want to go and make me feel this way?
And I don't understand what's happened,
I keep saying things I never say.

'Cause I can feel you watching even when you're nowhere to be seen,
And I can feel you touching even when you're far away from me.

Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself,
I don't wanna stay, wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest,
And I'm having trouble catching my breath.


Won't you please stop loving me to death?

I don't even see my friends no more
'Cause I keep hanging out with you
I don't know how you kept me up all night
Or how I got this tattoo

I can feel you watching even when you're nowhere to be seen
I can feel you touching even when you're far away from me

Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself,
I don't wanna stay, wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest,
And I'm having trouble catching my breath


Won't you please stop loving me to death?

I can feel you watching even when you're nowhere to be seen
I can feel you touching even when you're far away from me,

Every time I see you
Suddenly my heart begins to race,
Every time I leave
I don't know why my heart begins to break

Tell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll 'cause I can't control myself,
I don't wanna stay, wanna run away but I'm trapped under your spell.
And it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest,
And I'm having trouble catching my breath


Won't you please stop loving me to death?
