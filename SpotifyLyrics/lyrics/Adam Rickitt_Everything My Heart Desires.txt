One kiss
Heaven isn't far
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
It's everything my heart desires

There ain't no one better for me
Every day and night Baby, in my life
It's you-you're my front page story
Wanna tell the world
I'm in love with you girl
Can't believe it's real
Everything I feel
Baby, it's too hard to conceal

One kiss
Heaven isn't far
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
It's everything my heart desires

Thought I'd be forever searchin'
On an open road
I had nowhere to go
So I, I said a prayer and God heard it
Come and set me free
Send an angel to me
And then you appeared
Everything was clear
I just can't believe that you're here

One kiss
Heaven isn't far
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
It's everything my heart desires

The best thing 
Underneath the stars
You're everything my heart desires
Don't change
I love the way you are
You're everything my heart desires

One kiss
Heaven isn't far
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
It's everything my heart desirese
