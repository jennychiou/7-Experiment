My First Ride
Woohoo
Waiting outside
I'm stepping inside
Woohoo

I don't really care what everybody says
Got a hot ride, blows the girls away
Anyway all I wanna do is drive okay
Can't see, can't sleep uh and I can't wait
Anyday, anyday now it's official
AC on the plates my initials
The little weasel's now got diesel
I can hold the steering wheel steady, get ready

When I gotta refuel, crank the track up
Now I'm grown up but I ain't all sewn up
I'm coming through with the system blasting
Banging my head hell raisin' Blaisin'

Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
I wanna roll in the hoopty- a Bentley
Ridin' ridin' ridin'
Catch me or you're gonna be left lonely
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
When I'm riden riden riden
Ah ah ah...
Ridin' ridin' ridin'
Ah ah ah...
Ridin' ridin' ridin'

Rubber burn, rubber burn it's my turn
Take care when you cross the road - my concern
Feels like Formula One but Oh No
I'm gettin' pulled over by the 1-5-0
Woo-ooh woo-ooh What's the deal yo uh
Officer, tell me what's the problem-o
"You were drivin' way too slow
You've gotta do 60 you were doing 4-0"
Let me see your drivers license and registration
I don't need one it's Aaron's Alien Nation
I'm just Carter, here we go, then I laugh
If you let me off I'll write your daughter out an autograph
Then he laughed huh and said Sure uhah
Give me a ticket he said boy look uh
Get out of here before I lose my cool
And act like a driver "you know the rules"

Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
I wanna roll in the hoopty- a Bentley
Ridin' ridin' ridin'
Catch me, or you're gonna be left lonely
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
When I'm ridin' ridin' ridin'
Ah ah ah...
Ridin' ridin' ridin'
Ah ah ah...
Ridin' ridin' ridin'

Slow down,
My first ride
Woohoo
I'm stepping inside

Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
I wanna roll in the hoopty- a Bentley
Ridin' ridin' ridin'
Catch me, or you're gonna be left lonely
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
When I'm ridin' ridin' ridin'

Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
Ridin' ridin' ridin'
Catch me or you're gonna be left lonely
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
When I'm ridin' ridin' ridin'
Ah ah ah...
Ridin', ridin', ridin'...
Ah ah ah...
