Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time

Everyday you call me
Forever asking if I'm fine
I understand your worries
Because we're on each other's minds

But when tomorrow comes, I'll be up with the sun
Then I know you're coming home to me baby
And there's no doubt, we'll be steppin' out
Girl let me remind you of the good times

We're gonna party all night
Till the break of the light
Now is the time to celebrate our survival
And when we start to unwind
Making love's on my mind
Together we will celebrate our revival

Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Good times
Have a good time

All those weeks I never wondered
Were we wasting time
No doubt inside, girl I confide
Too much love is on the line

So get real close, let the love engross
And say your gonna stay with me baby
'Cause there's no doubt we'll be steppin' out
Girl let me remind you of the good times

We're gonna party all night
Till the break of the light
Now is the time to celebrate our survival
And when we start to unwind
Making love's on my mind
Together we will celebrate our revival

Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Good times
Good times, good times, good times
Have a good time

So get real close, let the love engross
And say your gonna stay with me baby
'Cause there's no doubt we'll be steppin' out
Girl let me remind you of the good times

We're gonna party all night
Till the break of the light
Now is the time to celebrate our survival
And when we start to unwind
Making love's on my mind
Together we will celebrate our revival
