This is everything I didn't say

Wait, don't tell me
Heaven is a place on earth
I wish I could rewind all
The times that I didn't
Show you what you're really worth
(What you're really worth)

The way that you held me
I wish that I'd put you first
I was wrong I admit
Numb from your kiss
While you were slipping through my fingertips

Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I've made
From all the letters that I've saved
This is everything I didn't say
I wish I could've made you stay
And I'm the only one to blame
I know that it's a little too late
This is everything I didn't say

This is everything I didn't say

Wake me up now
And tell me this is all a bad dream
All the songs that I wrote
All the wrongs that I hoped would erase from your memory
Holding onto a broken and empty heart
Flowers I should've bought
All the hours I lost
Wish I could bring it back to the start

Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I've made
From all the letters that I've saved
This is everything I didn't say
I wish I could've made you stay
And I'm the only one to blame
I know that it's a little too late
This is everything I didn't say

I hope you know
For you I'd sacrifice
To make this right

Some day I'm sure
We'll pass each other by
Until that time

Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I've made
From all the letters that I've saved
This is everything I didn't say
I wish I could've made you stay
And I'm the only one to blame
I know that it's a little too late
This is everything I didn't say

This is everything I didn't say
