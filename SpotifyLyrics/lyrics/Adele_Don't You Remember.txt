When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When will I see you again?
