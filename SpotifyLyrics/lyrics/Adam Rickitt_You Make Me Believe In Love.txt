It's of you I'm dreaming
The touch I'm needing
You make me believe in love
It's your scent I'm breathing
Your beauty I'm seeing
It makes me believe in love

I almost gave up on my dreams
Wouldn't know what true love means
But it feels so different
Deep inside of me
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
For the first time I'm alive
My heart is racing
Feel like I can fly

It's of you I'm dreaming
The touch I'm needing
You make me believe in love
It's your scent I'm breathing
Your beauty I'm seeing
It makes me believe in love
It's a new beginning
A reason for living
You make me believe in love
It's a whole new feeling
My faith is healing
You make me believe
Make me believe in love

You put the blue into my skies
You're the gold in my sunshine
You can make a rainbow
When there's no rain in sight
I never needed someone more
Suddenly I feel reborn
Like a child I want you to hold me in your arms

It's of you I'm dreaming
The touch I'm needing
You make me believe in love
It's your scent I'm breathing
Your beauty I'm seeing
It makes me believe in love
It's a new beginning
A reason for living
You make me believe in love
It's a whole new feeling
My faith is healing
You make me believe
Make me believe in love

Now that I see you 
Now that I feel you 
Now I believe in love
