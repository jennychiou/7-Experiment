Take my money

Black jeans, white tees, black converse
You know she gets it right
Blue hair, blue eyes, I saw her
I couldn't help it, I was like

I wanna be, be, be in the game
I wanna know, know your middle name
If we could go, go it won't be the same
Because right know, you're killing the game
Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive through please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling
Like ooh, ooh, take my money

Late night pass out in Tokyo
New York, LA, Chicago
She said her friends were at the show
Backstage, we'll let them in

They wanna be, be, be in the game
They wanna know, know what we gotta say
And in the front row, you're going insane
And in the back row, you're killing the game

Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive through please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive through please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place

You can all take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive through please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling
Like ooh, ooh, take my money
Take my money
