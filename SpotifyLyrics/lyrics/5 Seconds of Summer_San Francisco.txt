I can still taste you like it was yesterday
Making plans to rule the world, you were more than I deserved
I see you running in the sand, long hair blowing in the wind
Never thought that it would end

Leaves fall from the tallest trees
Even mountains crumble into the sea
Holding on to memories
And I can't let go

I wanna get back to where we started, to the summer night
You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right
Yeah, I wanna get back to San Francisco, in the fire light
You know, you know, you know, you know we had it right

Remember that weekend when we got out of town?
Drove into infinity, I held you 'til you fell asleep
Without you, the smell of your perfume
Reminds me of when we were free, I swear that it's still haunting me

Leaves fall from the tallest trees
Even mountains crumble into the sea
Holding on to memories
And I can't let go

I wanna get back to where we started, to the summer night
You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right
Yeah, I wanna get back to San Francisco, in the fire light
You know, you know, you know, you know we had it right

We don't gotta say anything, don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all, don't say a word at all
We don't gotta say anything, don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all, don't say a word at all

I wanna get back to where we started, to the summer night
You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right

I wanna get back to where we started, to the summer night
You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right
Yeah, I wanna get back to San Francisco, in the fire light
You know, you know, you know, you know we had it right

We don't gotta say anything, don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all, don't say a word at all
We don't gotta say anything, don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all, don't say a word at all
