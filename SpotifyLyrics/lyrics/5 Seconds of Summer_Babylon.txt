I thought we had a place, just our place, our home base, my headspace
Was you and I always, but that phase has been phased in our place
I see it on your face, a small trace, a blank slate, we've been erased
But if we're way too faded to drive, you can stay one more night

We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down, Babylon

Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

I'm tired of the feud, your short fuse, my half-truths are not amused
I wish we had a clue to start new, a white moon, no residue
The color of our mood is so rude, a cold June, we're not immune
But if we're way too faded to fight, you can stay one more night

We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down, Babylon

Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down, Babylon

Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down
