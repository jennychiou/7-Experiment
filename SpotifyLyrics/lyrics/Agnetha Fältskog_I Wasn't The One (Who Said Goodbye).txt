Your eyes and my eyes haven't talked in quite a while
Seems like a lifetime since I walked beside your smile
There's a dark cloud that's hanging above
Memories never lie, still we talk about the way that it was
And I think we both know the feelings haven't died.

I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night,
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try.

Your touch and my touch haven't spoken for some time
You say we've both changed and you're always on my mind
Always on my mind... I can tell you that it's over and done,
But I would only lose being close to the one that I want
So go on, and ask me if I'm still in love with you.

I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night,
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try.

No, there was no need for you to ask
Oh please don't ask,
You ought to know by now,
Oh babe, I want you back.

I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night,
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night,
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night,
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night...
