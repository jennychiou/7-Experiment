So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all you cares right behind
For the summertime

Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Lay back and unwind 'cause nothing else matters
For the summertime

I've been working real hard for just one reason
I've been waiting all year for just one season
The season that reminds me of
Palm trees, the smell, the ocean breeze and the sense of bein' free

Barbecues and pool parties, what I call fun
Hangin' with the hunnies and enjoyin' the sun
24 hours just to clean the Benz
So you can cruise down the boulevard with your friends

Sights on the beach have got your mind blowin'
Drinks on the chilled, the money is flowin'
Right here is where you belong
So if your down with me then get up and come along

So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares right behind
For the summertime

Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Just lay back and unwind 'cause nothing else matters
For the summertime

Had to take a sip on Ma's homemade
Freshly squeezed lemonade
Check out the hunnies through my brand new shades
As they lay on the sand toppin' up on the tans

Take in the scenery, the mood is fine
Nobody is wearin' their watches, nobody is checkin' the time
There is only one thing that's on everybody's mind
That's the summer, the summer, the summertime

Sights on the beach have got, your mind blowin'
Drinks on the chilled, the money is flowin'
Right here is where you belong
So if your down with me then get up and come along

So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares right behind
For the summertime

Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Lay back and unwind 'cause nothing else matters
For the summertime

Right now we're going to bring it
To ya one time

Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares behind
Everybody is feelin' the vibe
Of the summer, of the summer

Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares right behind
Everybody is feelin' the vibe
Of the summer, the summertime

Grab your stuff and let's go back inside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
But didn't we have a good time?

Destinations home, that's where we're going
The drinks are gone and the cash stopped flowin'
Say goodnight to all of your friends
'Cause when tomorrow comes we'll do it all again

So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares right behind
For the summertime

Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Just lay back and unwind 'cause nothing else matters
For the summertime

So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares right behind
For the summertime

Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Lay back and unwind 'cause nothing else matters
For the summertime
