I don't know what I want
So, don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone
On my own
And that's all I know
I'll be strong
I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today
Got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone
On my own
And that's all I know
I'll be strong
I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone
On my own
And that's all I know
I'll be strong
I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
