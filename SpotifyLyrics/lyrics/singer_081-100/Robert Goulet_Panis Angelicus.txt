Heavenly bread that becomes the bread for all mankind
Bread from the angelic host that is the end of all imaginings
O miraculous thing, this body of God will nourish
Even the poorest, the most humble of servants
Even the poorest, the most humble of servants

Thee we implore, O God, One in Three
So may Thou visit us as we now worship Thee
And lead us on Thy way that we at last may see
The light wherein Thou dwellest
The light wherein thou dwellest
