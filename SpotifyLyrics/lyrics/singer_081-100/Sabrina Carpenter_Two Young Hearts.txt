It's a narrow line I'm walking
Better watch my step
'Cause we got everybody talking
And I can hear them say

Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when you're older
What they don't know is
I've already made up my mind
And yes, I know what love is

'Cause we are
Two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts

They say we're too young
I could lie awake in darkness
Oh, just to dream of you
And you could lay your head on my chest
Yeah, just like you always do

Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when we're older
At least we know that
We've already made up our minds
And yes, we know what love is

'Cause we are
Two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts

We're gonna keep on running
Running for all that we are
We want it all or nothing
We knew it right from the start
We are a part of something
Something as old as time, time, time

'Cause we are
Two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts
You're never too young
