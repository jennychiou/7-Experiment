They said you can't wear Giamba, baby you gotta pay
Well then, we got a problem, problem
And there's a party at midnight at the top of the hill
But you gotta be someone, someone

And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh

Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

And we just go though the motions, yeah, we lock 'em inside
Don't show any emotion, emotion
And everybody's been talkin', believe it or not
But you don't gotta listen, listen

And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh

Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got?
I don't know
And is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got? Ooh

Or is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Is it just a mirage?
