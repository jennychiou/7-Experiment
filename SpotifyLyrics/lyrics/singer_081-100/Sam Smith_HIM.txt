Holy Father, we need to talk
I have a secret, that I can't keep
I'm not the boy that, you thought you wanted
Please don't get angry, have faith in me

Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

I walk the streets of Mississippi
I hold my lover by the hand
I feel you staring when he is with me
How can I make you understand?

Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

Oh, oh
Oh, I love
Oh, oh
No, no, I love
Oh, oh
I love
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Him I love
Oh, oh
Him I love
Oh, oh
Him I love
Oh, oh
Him I love

Holy Father, judge my sins
I'm not afraid of what they will bring
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
I love him
