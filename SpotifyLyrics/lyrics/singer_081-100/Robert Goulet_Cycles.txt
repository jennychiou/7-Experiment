So I'm down and I'm out,
But so are many others!
So I feel like tryin' to hide
My head 'neath these covers!

Life is like the seasons,
After Winter comes the Spring,
So I'll keep this smile awhile
And see what tomorrow brings.

I've been told and I believe
That life is meant for livin',
And even when my chips are low
There's still some left for givin'!

I've been many places,
Maybe not as far as you,
So I think I'll stay awhile
And see if some dreams come true!

There isn't much that I have learned
Through all my foolish years,
Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles;
First there's laughter, then there's tears!

But I'll keep my head up high,
Although I'm kinda tired;
My gal just up and left last week,
Friday, I got fired!

You know, it's almost funny,
But things can't get worse than now!
So I'll keep on tryin' to sing,
But please don't ask me how!
