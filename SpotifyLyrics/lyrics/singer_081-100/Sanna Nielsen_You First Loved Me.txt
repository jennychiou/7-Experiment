The world has taken me from you
Lured me away by the beauty of a dream
But I am standing here now
To search no more
Because you first loved me

Your memory dimmed in the distance
But there was always the voice you taught to sing
Calling me home to where my heart still belongs
To where you first loved me

Angels have stood
Tirelessly by my side
But now they're yours
And I can feel them fly

In the stillness of my silent prayer
I will place you in their care tonight
Tonight

And I will scatter the roses
Unto the snow where forever you will sleep
And you will know why I brought them here to you
Because you first loved
Because you first loved me

And I am standing here now in grateful tears
Because you loved me
First loved me
