Keep it casual, don't have to tippy toe
Take your cares off, just stay a couple more
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Go and get a little closer
Playing mind games, we don't do that here
So put your bid in, before I disappear
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Come and get a little closer

Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay, yeah

Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours, by the time that we leave
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh

I know your type works
What's with that mean behavior?
You let this oh la la la, intimidate ya
Don't you make me, don't you make me leave on my own
I'm already ready, come on

Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay, yeah

Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours, by the time that we leave
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh
