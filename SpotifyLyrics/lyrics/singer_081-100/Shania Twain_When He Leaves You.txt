I come here as a friend
Though I don't really know you
I know you're in love with him
And he's made your world brand new

I know you think he loves you 
And he may believe it too
Pour some coffee and I'll tell you 
What you'll soon be going through

When he leaves you
It's gonna more than break your heart
When he leaves you
It's gonna tear your world apart
And you're conna cry a million teardrops
One for every shattered dream
When he leaves you
And comes back home to me

I've known him all thses years
Honey this time's not the first time
I've paid for loving him with tears
And when it's over he'll be mine

I can see I've upset you
Guess I'm a fool to try and help
When it comes hearts and heartache
You got to find out for yourself

When he leaves you
It's gonna more than break your heart
When he leaves you
It's gonna tear your world apart
And you're conna cry a million teardrops
One for every shattered dream
When he leaves you
And comes back home to me

When he leaves you 
And comes back home to me
