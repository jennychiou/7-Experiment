Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa

Tonight we come alive
Stand up cause you got that pride
Dancin' and the sweat don't dry
Once shot, so baby hit it right
No doubt 'cause we're young and free
Walk like you run the city
Write your name in the sky
Live it up, cause baby it's your time

It's in the way you hold yourself,
He gotta know you're something else,
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy sexy sexy

Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa

We got nothing to lose, we got nothing to prove
Shine like diamonds in the sky
Live it up 'cause baby it's your time

It's in the way you hold yourself,
He gotta know you're something else,
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy sexy sexy

Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Rum pa pa pam pa, rum pa pa pam pa

Throw down let 'em know that you got fight

Throw down let 'em know that you got fight
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy
