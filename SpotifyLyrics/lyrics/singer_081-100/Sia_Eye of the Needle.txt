Take me down
I'm, I'm feeling now
And if I move on
I, I admit you're gone

I ain't ready
I'll hold steady
Yeah, I'll hold you in my arms
In my arms, in my arms

Woah, and you're locked inside my heart
Woah, and your melody's an art
Woah, and I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle

Step and repeat, oh
Tears fall to the beat, oh
Smile through the pain, oh
Feel the acid rain

And I ain't ready
But I'll hold steady
Yeah, I'll hold you in my arms
In my arms, in my arms

Woah, and you're locked inside my heart
Woah, and your melody's an art
Woah, and I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle

My bags heavy, been filled by me
They weigh me down, carry them 'round
It's all mine, all mine
I am blinded by the eye of the needle

Woah, and you're locked inside my heart
Woah, and your melody's an art
Woah, and I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle
Eye of the needle

You're locked inside my heart
Woah, and your melody's an art
Woah, and I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle

Oh
And oh
Oh
