Maybe I'm done, maybe it's true
Maybe I had one chance and I lost it with you
We fell so hard, with nothing to lose
I'll never love again, I'll never love you

'Cause I gave, my heart, to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (my heart)
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
Now I have nothing left for you
I have nothing left for you

I can't pretend, pretend that I care
I see how you look at me, but I am not there
The damage is done, I'll save you the time
And if there are feelings there, they are not mine

'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (my heart)
To a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (my heart)
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you
Oh, I have nothing left for you

You won't hear me say those words again
This is something that you cannot mend
Can't you see I am a product of my own past?
So I know this will never last
And I will not cover your fears
I will not pick up your tears
I'll live out the rest of my days alone

'Cause I gave, my heart, to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave, my heart, to a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you
