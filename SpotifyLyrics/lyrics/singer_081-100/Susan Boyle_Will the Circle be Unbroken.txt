There are loved ones in the glory
Whose dear forms you often miss
When you close your earthly story
Will you join them in their bliss?

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, by and by?
Is a better home awaiting
In the sky, in the sky?

In the joyous days of childhood
Of they told of wondrous love
Pointed to the dying saviour
Now they dwell with him above

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, by and by?
Is a better home awaiting
In the sky, in the sky?

You remember songs of heaven
Which you sang with childish voice
Do you love the hymns they taught you
Or are songs of earth your choice?

You can picture happy gath'rings
Round the fireside long ago
And you think of tearful partings
When they left you here below

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, by and by?
Is a better home awaiting
In the sky, in the sky?

One by one their seats were emptied
One by one they went away
Now the family is parted
Will it be complete one day?

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, by and by?
Is a better home awaiting
In the sky, in the sky?
