(With Lionel Richie)

When the world is filled with thunder and the winds are storming above,
Deep within the night we wonder if we've lost the magic of love.
But there's something inside us that looks to the sun.
We dream that this light will guide us with love for everyone.

When the birds of war are flying and the clouds are heavy with rain,
Seems as though the skies are crying, and we feel the cold tears of pain.
But there's something inside us that looks to the sun.
We dream that this light will guide us with love for everyone.
Love is there for us, everywhere for us
In the sound of praying, little children playing
Open your heart.
Love to each of us, here in each of us

Constant as the moon glows, or the way the grass grows
Always and forever.
Love is the river that fills every sea,
And it's waters that mirror the way life should be.

When the world is free of thunder, and the skies are peaceful above,
Once again we'll know the wonder of the magic power of love,
Oh, the magic of love.
