We are born
Without a care
As we grow old
Become aware
As we grow tall, begin to falter
We want to know ourselves, give love to all

And we falter
Yes we are human
Yes we anger
We feed the hunger
Yes we push through
Just me and you

We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh yes we stand together

A fantasy
For you and me
Though beauty lies
In reality
No need to fear, the truth sets us free
We're all looking for love and harmony

But we falter, and yes we are flawed
We play victim
With such conviction
And we play bully
Both you and me

We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh yes we stand together

Took it day by day, worried we would fail
How we flailed and we wailed and we screamed in pain
Take it step by step, we could not forget the wounds
We felt how we screamed for help
And the dark dark nights when you held me tight
And we'd wait for light to rescue us
Oh we were distressed
Now we're nothing less
We are strong we are blessed
We are united

We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh yes we stand together
We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh yes we stand together
