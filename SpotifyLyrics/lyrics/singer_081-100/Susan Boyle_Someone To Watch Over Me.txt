There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told, "seek and you shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet

She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add her initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherddes for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although I may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To her heart I carry the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone who'll watch over me

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone to watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although I may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To her heart I carry the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
