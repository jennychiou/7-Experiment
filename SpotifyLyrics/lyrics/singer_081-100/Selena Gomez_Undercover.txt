I look at you, and all I wanna do, is just disappear
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get out of here
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know my heart

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover,
You don't need no other lover
You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
