Frosted window panes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted cany canes on the the tree
Santa's on his way,
He's filled his slay
With things, things for you and for me

It's the time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear
Seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your new year dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too

Merry Christmas
May your new year dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too
Merry Christmas to you
