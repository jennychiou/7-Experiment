I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Someboy told me that her name was Jill
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yeah, my heart stood still
Yes, her name was Jill
And when I walked her home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

I knew what she was thinkin' when she caught my eye
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
She looked so quiet but my oh my
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yeah, she caught my eye
Yes, my oh my
And when I walked her home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

"(Ooh)
(Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron)
(Ooh)

Well, I picked her up at seven and she looked so fine
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Someday soon I'm gonna make her mine
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yeah, she looked so fine
Yes, I'll make her mine
And when I walked her home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
