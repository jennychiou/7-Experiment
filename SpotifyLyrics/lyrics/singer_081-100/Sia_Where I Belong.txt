Without truth
We lose
Yet we want to spare the feelings of those we love
Don't cry
We've all lied
But there is always room for forgiveness, my friend

So don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me

Shine
You're fine
See I will always have a smile for you, my love
And still
We will
Be OK and along the way we'll learn a thing or two

So don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see 
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me

So don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here with me, my sweet

Don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
Where I belong
And soon you will see
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me

Don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
Where I belong
And soon you will see
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me

So don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
Where I belong
And soon you will see
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me

So don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
Where I belong
Soon you will see
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me

So don't treat me bad
Just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see
We are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me
