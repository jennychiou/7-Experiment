I'm a broken biscuit
From the cookie jar
I'm a total misfit
In the puzzle that's so far
Careful not to crush me
In those hungry hands
Careful not to rush me
Into this fine romance

I stand under the weight of your words
Hoping you won't find me
I'm terrified of everything I've heard
Don't swallow

I'm a damaged dollar
Than no-one wants to change
I'm a bunch of flowers
That need to be arranged
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you say
I've lowered all my armour
Risking the pain again

I stand under the weight of your words.
Hoping you won't find me.
I'm terrified of everything I've heard,
Don't swallow

I'm standing on the edge of your words
And that is where you'll find me
I'm paralysed by all the things that hurt
But I'm coming

I stand under the weight of your words
Hoping you won't find me
I'm paralysed by all the things I heard
Don't swallow

I'm standing on the edge of your words
Standing on the edge of your words
I'm paralysed by all the things that hurt
But I'm coming
