Ho ho ho
Bring a bottle of rum
Ho ho ho
Cream and whiskey bourbon
Ho ho ho
Bring a bottle of booze
We've got nothing to lose
Ho ho, ho
Ho ho ho
Bring a friend if you please
Ho ho ho
Santa's hoping to meet
Ho ho ho
All the misfits and us
I hope the misfits show up
Ho ho, ho

Ho ho ho
It don't get better than this
Ho ho ho
In the land of misfits
Ho ho ho
We're all losin' our lids
We got nothing but this
Ho ho, ho
Ho ho ho
Come be our family
Ho ho ho
This is Christmas baby
Ho ho ho
Bring a friend if you please
Bring them all to their knees
Ho ho, ho
