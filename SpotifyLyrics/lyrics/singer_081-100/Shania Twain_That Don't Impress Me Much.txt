I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original know-it-all

Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're all right
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

Uh huh, yeah-ha

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve, just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
'Cause heaven forbid, it should fall out of place

Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

That don't impress me much
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're all right
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

Ow
Yeah
Hoo!

You're one of those guys that likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Now, come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?

Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you've got a car

That don't impress me much
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're all right
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much
You think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're all right
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Uh huh, yeah-ha

Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
That don't impress me much
Oh no
That don't impress me much
Oh no
Uh-ow
Yeah
Hoo!
Uh uh-uh, now
All right, all right
You're Tarzan
Captain Kirk, maybe
John Wayne
