It's Monday and I hear you when you say you hate that day
Me too but there's nothing much about it we can do
Let's just get to

Countin' down the hours dreamin' of all of our favourite songs
We know the words by heart and we will shout and be singin' along
As loud as we like, Friday night

More fun is what we need
Every-one is on their feet
The weekend's here and all we want to do is be together
Get a little crazy and forget what happens later
We made it through the week, now we're headed to the street
More fun is what we need

One day we'll be sitting back laughing all about the times
We were doin' donuts in the parking lots and running lights
The time of our lives

Is here and now and yes we've got the power 'cause we know it all
We're just getting started open hearted, having a ball
Nothing but time, on our side

And more fun is what we need
Every-one is on their feet
The weekend's here and all we want to do is be together
Get a little crazy and forget what happens later
We made it through the week, now we're headed to the street

The day was long but the night is young and we ain't got to worry
We're running' outta light but that's alright, no need to hurry
Morning such a long way away and we, we got all night to play

More run is what we need
Every-one is on their feet
The weekend's here and all we want to do is be together
Get a little crazy and forget what happens latter
We made it through the week, now we're headed to the street
Because more fun is what we need
More fun is all we need
