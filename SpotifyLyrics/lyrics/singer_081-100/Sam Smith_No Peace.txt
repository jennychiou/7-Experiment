I see you in the morning, feel your fingers in my hair
Sometimes I still pretend you're all there
It hits me without warning, your reflection walking by
But I know it's only in my mind

Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't get back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darling you know that

So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothing left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief

You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace
No peace

All that I am asking is for a little clarity
That's all that really matters to me
In and out of focus, tears are in my eyes
We're burning down the bridges this time

Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darling you know that

So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothing left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief

You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find

I used to find comfort in your arms
Caught up in the wonder of your charms
Oh, I'll cry for you, I'll cry for you
I'll lie for you, I'll lie for you
But I don't even know you anymore

So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothing left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief

You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace

Sure won't find no peace, no
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?
