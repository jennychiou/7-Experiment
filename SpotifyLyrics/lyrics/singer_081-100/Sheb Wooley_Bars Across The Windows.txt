Bars across the windows bars across the door
I'm locked behind these everlastin' bars forever more
Take away these bars across the windows bars across the door
I'm locked behind these everlastin' bars forever more

(Well uh tell me your story son)

It was late one evening as the sun went down
Money in my pocket as I rode into town
I saw my sweetheart in the arms of dashin' Billy Brown
In a flash of anger I shot old Billy down

Now I've got bars across the windows bars across the door
I'm locked behind these everlastin' bars forever more

(Uh then what did you do son)

Billy lay so quiet his lips as cold as clay
I headed south for Texas a thousand miles away
Headlines scream a warnin' killer on the run
My luck played out in Texas looking down a ranger's gun

Now I've got bars across the windows...

(Well what did they do to yuh boy)

The judge rapped down his mallet the court was hushed and quiet
The jury brought the verdict I grew sick inside
My sweetheart was crying vowed she loved me true
As they led me to this jailhouse where I've got life to do

Now I've got bars across the windows...
I've got these bars across the windows...
