Our father which art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth
As it is in heaven

Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive our debts
As we forgive our debtors

And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory forever

For thine is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory forever

Amen
