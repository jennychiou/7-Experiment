Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild

You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

My sweet devoted counterpart
We kept each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild

Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild
Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild

We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (whoa)
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild
