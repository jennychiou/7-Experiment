When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high,
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky,
And the sweet silver song of a lark.
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown, ooh, ooh
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone, ooh
You never walk a-lone
