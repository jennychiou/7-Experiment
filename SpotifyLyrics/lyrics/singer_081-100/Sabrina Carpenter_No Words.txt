No words, no words, no words

When everything is quiet
Nothing on the tip of your tongue
But a beautiful silence
And it lets me know
That even in the madness
When everything just seems to go wrong
Take a beautiful silence
'Cause it lets me know

Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars

When everything is
Up and down, up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to
Beat you down, beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is
Up and down, up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)

When I'm in the darkness
The dawn is having you by my side
'Cause you leave me speechless
And it lets me know
Where nobody can hear us
I'll tell you everything with my eyes
'Cause you leave me speechless
And I think you know

When everything is
Up and down, up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to
Beat you down, beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is
Up and down, up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)

No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
No words, no

No, no, no
No words
No, no

When everything is
Up and down, up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to
Beat you down, beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue (tip of your tongue)
When everything is
Up and down, up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)

No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words

(No words, no words, no words)
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart
(No words, no words, no words)
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
(No, no, no words)

(No words, no words, no words)
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart (beatin' in the bars, no)
I can hear your heart
(No words, no words, no words)
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
(No, no, no words)

Baby, no words, no words, no words
