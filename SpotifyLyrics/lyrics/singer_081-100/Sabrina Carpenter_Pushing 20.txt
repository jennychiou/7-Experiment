W-w-w-whatcha say Mr. Clean
I'm flagging you down for a misdemean', nah
It must look different from your mezzanine
You got me, got me feeling
Out of touch, Hall & Oates
Push it out, wish me luck

You got a way, you messing with my faith
You tryna paint a picture but you running out of paint
You had your say 'til I took it away
Out of yours in my controlla

I'm pushing 20 got no time for others
I'm pushing 20 got no time for others
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

I'm pushing 20 got no time for others
I'm pushing 20 got no time for others
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

I'm pushing 20 I ain't talking 'bout a Beemer
And while you're wasting time, the money's in the meter
So I can start from scratch, make you a believer
Or I can just, da da da
Act like I don't give a-

You got a way, you messing with my faith
You tryna paint a picture but you running out of paint
You had your say 'til I took it away
Out of yours in my controlla
