The worse I thirst for water the more it comes to my sight
I see a clear blue lake before me we'll quench out thirst tonight

So move along ol' pony soon we'll thirst no more
And when we reach that haven you'll graze along the shore

We've wandered through the wasteland just one more hill to climb
Then we'll drink our fill of water and rest for a long long time

I see the water is sinking sinking into the burning sand
And we will die for water here in this barren land

So move along ol' pony just one more hill to climb
And we'll drink our fill of water and rest for a long long time
