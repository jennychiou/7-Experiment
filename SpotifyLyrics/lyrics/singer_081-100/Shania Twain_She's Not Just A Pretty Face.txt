(Oh na, na, na)

She hosts a TV show--she rides the rodeo
She plays the bass in a band
She's an astronaut--
A valet at the parking lot
A farmer working the land
She is a champion--she gets the gold
She's a ballerina--the star of the show

She's--not--just a pretty face
She's--got--everything it takes
She has a fashion line--
A journalist for "Time"
Coaches a football team
She's a geologist--a romance novelist
She is a mother of three
She is a soldier--she is a wife
She is a surgeon--she'll save your life

She's--not--just a pretty face
She's--got--everything it takes
She's--mother--of the human race
She's--not--just a pretty face

Oh, oh, yeah
Oh na, na, na, na...
She is your waitress--she is your judge--
She is your teacher
She is every woman in the world

Oh, la, la, la
She flies an airplane--
She (dirve) a subway train
At night she pumps gasoline
She's on the council--she's on the board
She's a politician--she praises the Lord

She's--not--just a pretty face
She's--got--everything it takes
She's--mother--of the human race
She's--not--just a pretty face

No, she's (she's) not (not)--
Just a pretty face
She's (she's) got (got)--everything it takes
She's--not--just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's not just a pretty face
