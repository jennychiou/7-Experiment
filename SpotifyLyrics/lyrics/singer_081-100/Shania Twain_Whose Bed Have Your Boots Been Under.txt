Whose bed have your boots been under?
Hoo!

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you 'round with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I heard you've been sneakin'
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill?
And I've seen you walkin'
With long legs Louise
And you weren't just talkin'
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

Come on, boots
Hoo!
Whoa, oh yeah
Hoo!
Hoo!
Bring it, boys

So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder?

I wanna know
Whose bed, baby
Whoa, baby, tell me
Whose bed, yes, I wanna know
You better start talkin'
Or you better start walkin'
