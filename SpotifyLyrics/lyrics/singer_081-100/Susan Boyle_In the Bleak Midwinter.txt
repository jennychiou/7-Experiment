In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, long ago

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain
Heaven and Warth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ

Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before
The ox and ass and camel which adore

What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part
Yet what can I give Him, give my heart
