Together-midnight in summer
The air's so much warmer
Falling in love under starlight
Holding on so tight-together

I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be all right
I won't leave you lonely tonight

Imagine-the air filled with jasmine
The breeze blows with passion
You and me dance with desire
The moon is on fire-imagine

I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be all right
I won't leave you lonely tonight

Je t'aime beaucoup mon amour
You are the one I adore

I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be all right
No you won't be lonely tonight

Te amo mucho mi amor
You are the one I adore
Te amo
