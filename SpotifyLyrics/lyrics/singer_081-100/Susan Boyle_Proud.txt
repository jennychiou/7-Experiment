All of my life I have watched you
Climbing mountains, chasing dreams
All of my life you gave me everything
But you don't have to give the world to me

Just say you love me as I am,
Say you want me as I am,
Say I'm someone in your eyes,
That's all I want it to be
Oh, just let me go, I know one day if I'm allowed,
If I'm allowed, one day I'll make you proud

All of your life you've taken chances
You've broke the rules time after time
All of your life you've gone your own way,
So give me this chance, and I'll go mine

Why can't you say you love me as I am,
Say you want me as I am,
Say I'm someone in your eyes,
That's all I want it to be
Oh, just let me go, I know one day if I'm allowed,
If I'm allowed, one day I'll make you proud

Oh

And trying to please you now, it's all I seem to do
I've got to be me now 'cause there's already one of you
I'm on my knees so help me please

Please don't shoot me down
Though you can't see it now
Someday I'll make you proud
