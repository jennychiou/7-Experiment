If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
How I'd leave in autumn, I never would know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, it couldn't it be in springtime
Knowing how in spring, I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
No never, could I leave you at all

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime
Knowing how in spring, I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
No never, could I leave you at all
