Maybe I had too many drinks but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told the joke and we're the only ones laughin'

Don't know why I tried, 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment, every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now if you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

What if my dad is right, and he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
Call you when it's late, and I know that you're on bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead

And I don't know why I tried, 'cause there ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now if you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah

And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word, and I'll change my plans
Yeah, you know that we fit together
I know your heart like the back of my hand

So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Even ten years from now if you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', oh
Even ten years from now if you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
