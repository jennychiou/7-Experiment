Hey you, sittin' in the corner
Can't ya hear the jukebox playin'
Everybody's up doing the two-step
And you're not even tappin' your toe

Won't you let a lady buy you a cold brew
Loosen you up a little more than you dare to
Maybe take a ride in my Cadillac
God ain't gonna getcha for that

God ain't gonna getcha for that
He's much too busy with the guys in the black hats
There's nothin' wrong with a man and a woman flirtin' with a honky-tonk moon
God ain't gonna pay no attention
If we're just makin' use of his invention
Come on, baby don't hold back
God ain't gonna getcha for that

I can tell you're the quiet type
Are you new in town or just a little bit shy
Didn't you ever catch me lookin'?
I've been eyeing you all night
Won't you let a lady buy you a cold brew
Loosen you up a little more than you dare to
Maybe take a ride in my Cadillac
God ain't gonna getcha for that

God ain't gonna getcha for that
He's much too busy with the guys in the black hats
There's nothin' wrong with a man and a woman flirtin' with a honky-tonk moon
God ain't gonna pay no attention
If we're just makin' use of his invention
Come on, baby don't hold back
God ain't gonna getcha for that

God ain't gonna getcha for that
He's much too busy with the guys in the black hats
There's nothin' wrong with a man and a woman flirtin' with a honky-tonk moon
God ain't gonna pay no attention
If we're just makin' use of his invention
Come on, baby don't hold back
God ain't gonna getcha for that

No... God ain't gonna getcha for that
God ain't gonna getcha for that
