Well you were waiting for me, you saw me, adored me
As I wish the whole world would
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me
For all the things you thought you could

Yeah, you would lick the tears from my eyes when I cried
How I missed you when I was gone
Hurt me so to leave you, deceive you, I needed you
I believed in you

Oh I, I never meant to let you down
Awake with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart

Now all I have is riches and pictures and stitches
Money could never buy what you gave
And though my heart is aching and breaking, I'm making
The most of what you send my way

Now I want just to hold you, unfold you, I told you
See, I am coming back for you
Yeah, I know we will be okay, everyday the sun
Shines a little brighter

Oh and I, I never meant to let you down
I'll wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
Yeah, I'm trying not to fall apart

I never meant to let you down
I'll wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
And I'm trying not to fall apart
Yeah, I'm trying not to fall apart

We'll reunite, oh, we'll set alight
I'm wishing with all of my might

Oh no, I never meant to let you down
"(I'll wait with a stake in my heart)"
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I never meant to let you down
"(I'll wait with a stake in my heart)"
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall
