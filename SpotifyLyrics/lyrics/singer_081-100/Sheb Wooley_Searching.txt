(Uh huh searching I'm a searching)

Once I was troubled restless and weary
And my days seemed so blue
Then I wandered into the woodlands
I was searching Lord for you

There the little birds (searching Lord)
All were singing (I'm a searching)
And their sweet songs (searching Lord)
Thrilled me anew (for you)
All the trees (searching Lord) and flowers
Were budding (I'm a searching for you)
Searching Lord for you

Then I felt something far greater than me and my old blues
I raised my head to the heavens and I knew the way to choose

Then as I walked (searching Lord)
Away from my troubles (I'm a searching)
With a breeze (searching Lord)
Caressing my cheek (for You)
I forgot (searching Lord) my woes
And my worries (I'm a searching for You)
I found the truth I seek

Yes I felt something far greater...
Then as I walked (searching Lord)...
I found the truth I seek
