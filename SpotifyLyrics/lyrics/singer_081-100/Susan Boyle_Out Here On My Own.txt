Sometimes I wonder where I've been 
Who I am, do I fit in. 
Make believin' is hard alone 
Out here on my own 
We're always proving who we are 
Always reaching for that rising star 
To guide me far, and shine me home 
Out here on my own 
When I'm down and feelin' blue, 
I close my eyes so I can be with you. 
Baby be strong for me, baby belong to me 
Help me through, help me need you 
Until the morning sun appears 
Making light of all my fears, 
I dry the tears I've never shown 
Out here on my own 
But when I'm down and feelin' blue 
I close my eyes so I can be with you 
Oh baby be strong for me, baby belong to me 
Help me through, help me need you. 
Sometimes I wonder where I've been, 
Who I am, do I fit in. 
I may not win, but I can't be thrown, 
Out here on my own. 
Out here on my own.
