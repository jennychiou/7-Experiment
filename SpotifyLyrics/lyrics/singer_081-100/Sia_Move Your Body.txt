Poetry on your body
You got it in every way
And can't you see it's you I am watching
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around, let me see you
Want to free you with my rhythm
I know you can't get enough
When I turn up with my rhythm

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I want to be your muse, your music
Let the movement be the rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I want to be your muse, your music
Let the movement be the rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body

Poetry on your body
Got me started, it'll never end
Feel my rhythm in your system
This is heaven, I'm your only friend
Feel the beat in your chest
Beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from its cage
Free the rage like an animal

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I want to be your muse, your music
Let the movement be the rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I want to be your muse, your music
Let the movement be the rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body

You body's poetry
Move your body for me
Your body's poetry
Move your body for me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me...

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I want to be your muse, your music
Let the movement be the rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I want to be your muse, your music
Let the movement be the rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body
