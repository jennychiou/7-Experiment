They may say we're done
That we will never win this one
But we know differently
They don't know you and they don't know me

We got something they don't
A fire burning deep in our bones
Smokin' when were away
On fire when we get home

Heres to hanging tough
When no one else believed in us
Cheers to staying strong
They gave up but we carried on

We got something they don't
A fire burning deep in our bones
Smokin' when were away
On fire when we get home

We got something they don't
Flame's so high, let's go wild
We're on fire, we're home, sweet home
Don't it taste good to be together

We got something they don't
A fire burning deep in our bones
Smokin' when were away
On fire when we get home

We got something (woo)
Don't it feel good
Yes this is our home
We got something they don't
We're on fire when we get home
