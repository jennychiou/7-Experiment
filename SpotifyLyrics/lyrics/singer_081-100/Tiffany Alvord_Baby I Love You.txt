There are three words, that I've been dying to say to you
Burns in my heart, like a fire that ain't goin' out
There are three words, & I want you to know they are true...
I need to let you know
I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight
I want your arms around me & I, want your lips on mine
I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified
My hands are shaking, my heart is racing
'Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny
So here I go...

Baby I lo-o-o-ve you

I've never said, these words to anyone, anyone at all
Never got this close, 'cause I was always afraid I would falll
But now I know, that I'll fall right in-to your arms...
Don't ever let me go
I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight
I want your arms around me & I, want your lips on mine
I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified
My hands are shaking, my heart is racing
'Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny
So here I go...
Baby I lo-o-o-ve you
Take it in, breathe the air
What is there to really fear
I can't contain, what my heart's sayin'
I gotta say it out loud...
I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight
I want your arms around me & I, want your lips on mine
I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified
My hands are shaking, my heart is racing
'Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny
So here I go...

Baby I lo-o-o-o-ve you
