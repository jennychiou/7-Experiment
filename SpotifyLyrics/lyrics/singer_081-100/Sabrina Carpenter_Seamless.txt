Good morning, you're leaving
I'll see you in the evening
My best friend till the end
My better have no pretend
Our language is sacred
Though people try to solve it
New adventures on the way

You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
Woah oh, yeah, woah oh

We're klutzy, but so lucky
That I always have you to catch me
We're partners in crime
You're stuck with me your whole life
So different, out of our minds
From a planet that's hard to find
Every second every day

You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless

You're right by my side whenever I need you
Through the hardest times
I'll be there for you
At the crack of dawn when the moon is gone
I won't be hard to find
'Cause you and me, oh yeah we're seamless

You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
Woah oh, woah oh
