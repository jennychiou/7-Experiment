Death by chocolate is myth
This I know because I lived
I've been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands, little girl
This is only right now

Death by crying doesn't exist
Though the headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode
But you reach the end of the road
And you, little tree
I'm certain you will grow

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh, my weeping willow let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling, the seasons are your friend

Death by anger this is true
Oh, just let him go, he can't hurt you
Oh little girl, this is such a cruel, cruel world
This is the first of a million broken hearts

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again "(just how to love again)"
Oh, my weeping willow let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling, the seasons are your friend

Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong
Up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong
Up, up and away

Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong
Up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong
Up, up and away

Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong
Up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long you will grow strong
Up, up and away

He's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf, yeah

He's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf
