So what if I just wanna be a little bit out of my mind
I let you take my heart and I like it
So what if I have been to be
A little bit out of my mind
I better steal your heart and you'll like it

And I don't think it's any kind of secret
I feel you from a million miles away

And your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun, but it's never gonna stop
The best thing, best thing that I got

I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
And sometimes I can tell that I
I'm just a little out of time
I make you skip a beat and I know it

But I don't think it's any kind of secret
I think of u a billion times a day

And your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun, but it's never gonna stop
It's the best, the best thing that I got

So don't feel lonely tonight
You know I'll never be hard to find
So don't go out of your mind
You know I'll never be too hard to find

I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it

Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun but it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got
Your love is the best thing
And it's only just begun
It's the best thing
