I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

This inconsistency, what does it mean?
You got me questioning, the way you act and take it back
Do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

Are you playin' me, is this a game?
When you show up late, say love at 2 A.M
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah
What do you want from me?
Baby, oh

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me
