I wasn't just broken, I was shattered
I trusted you so much, you're all that mattered
You no longer loved me and I sang like a sad bird
I couldn't move on and I think you were flattered

Oh life's about joy, life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved and love the way I should
Life's about, life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good

The longer my tears fell, the wider the river
It killed me that you'd give your life to be with her
I had to believe that, things would get better
It was time to forget you, forever

Oh life's about joy, life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved and love the way I should
Life's about, life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good

Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good

It took me so long, to be strong
But I'm alive and I hold on
To what I can feel It hurts to heal
Oh when love lies

About to get good
About to get good
About to get... good

Oh life's about joy, life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved and love the way I should
Life's about, life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good

Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about to get good
Oh life's about joy, life's about pain
Life's about, life's about to get good
