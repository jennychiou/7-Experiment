Will I ever see the sunshine bright will I ever see the gold moonlight 
Will I ever will I ever again
Will I ever taste happiness will I ever forget loneliness
Will I ever will I ever again

Will I ever know your love again will I ever smile or laugh again
Will I ever or will I never again
Will I ever see your eyes divine will I ever feel your lips on mine
Will I ever will I ever again

Will I ever know your love again
