Done everything and done it again
Not every party needs our attendance

Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been taking
Maybe we could take one off

Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight

Not like I wanna keep you inside, yeah
But I was hoping we could switch up how we're spending our time

Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been taking
Maybe we could take one off

Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah (I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight

I just want that hand hold, with the sweat in the middle
Running down to when I feel alone and the feeling gone you can touch it a little
Hear me underneath the covers, coloring your body, reading Braille
Take you to Bahamas, seeping through the sand
Sucking out the silence, now I'm in your ear
Telling you baby to listen, I just

Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in, right
Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine
Maybe I been on the Internet forgetting how to keep it slow
But no I need it bitty bad bone Bonnie Clyde, come and get it
I don't know I get it, get it, I get it oh

Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah we keep going, keep going
(I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
