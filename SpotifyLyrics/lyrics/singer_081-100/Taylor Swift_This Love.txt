Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go
On and on, on and on and I will

Skies grow darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just
Gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams
And wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggle through the night for someone new
And, yeah, I could go
On and on, on and on

Lantern burning
Flickered in the mind, only you
But you're still
Gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip
Oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love
This love, this love, this love, this love

You'll kiss my cheek
I watched you leave
You'll smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love
This love, this love, this love, this love
