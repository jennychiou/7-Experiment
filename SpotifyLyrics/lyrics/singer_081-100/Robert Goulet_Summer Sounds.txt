Happy summer sounds
The summer sounds I love

Listen to the music of the carousel
The tinglelingle, lingle of the icecream bell
Splishing and a splashing and a moonlight swim
Roaring up the waves when you're surfing in

June, July and August play a symphony
Under starry skies above
Happy summer sounds
The summer sounds I love

The travelling on a steamboat on a Sunday cruise
The sizzle of the hotdogs and a barbecue
The swinging of a rollercoaster way up high
The whistles on the beach when "a peach" goes by

Summer time is here
Wake up and come alive
Put away scarf and blouse
Here come summer sounds,
The summer sounds I love

Summer time is here
Wake up and come alive
Put away scarf and blouse
Together now:

"Here come summer sounds
Summer sounds, summer sounds
Here come summer sounds
The summer sounds I love"
