If I were the moon
I could catch your eye
I'm jealous of the moon
If I were the wind
I would make you fly
I'm jealous of that too

I wish I were the sun shining on your face
Caressing like a lover
I would wrap you in a warm embrace
We'd be holdin' one another
(I'm jealous of the sun)
I'm jealous of the sun
(Jealous of the sun)
Oh I'm jealous of the sun

Oh I don't wanna share you with nothing else
I gotta have you to myself
Oh I can't help it I'm so in love
I just can't get you close enough
No

When the sun's on your skin
I can't hold it in
And I know it's a sin
But I'm jealous of the sun

I wish I were the rain runnin' down your neck
And drippin' from your fingers
Then I could be the drops rollin' off your back
I'd love to let it linger
(Jealous of the rain)
Oh I'm jealous of the rain

Oh I don't wanna share you with nothing else
I gotta have you to myself
Oh I can't help it I'm so in love
I just can't get you close enough
No

When it rains on your face
I almost can taste
Your beauty, your grace
I'm jealous of the rain

Oh yeah yeah
Jealous of the rain

When the wind's in your hair
(I can feel it blowing)
The way it blows through the air
(It's so unfair)
Oh it seems so unfair
Yeah

When the moon's in your eyes
You seem to light up the skies
Yeah
And I realize
I'm even jealous of the moon
