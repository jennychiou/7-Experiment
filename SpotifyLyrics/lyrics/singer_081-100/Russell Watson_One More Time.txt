Nothing I must do
Nowhere I should be
No one in my life
To answer to, but me
No more candlelights
No more purple skies
No one to be near
As my heart slowly dies

If I could hold you one more time
Like in the days when you were mine
Id look at you
Till I was blind
So you would stay
Id say a prayer each time you smile
Cradle the moments like a child
Id stop the world if only i
Could hold you one more time

I've memorized your face
I know your touch by heart
Still lost in your embrace
I dream of where you are
