What's the use in choppin' wood
Or tryin' to be like Robin Hood
Or doin' other things that you shou-ou-ou-ould
It may not be a lot of fun
But try and get your homework done
For soon you'll grow up and you'll know
How I told you to clean your room and make your bed
Don't be such a sleepy head
Remember all the things that mama sai-ai-ai-aid
Your gonna fall in love one day
Find someone and move away
Then you'll have kids of your own
And you'll tell them

It's up to you, you can be all that you wanna be (wanna be-ee)
Just see it through, for it will happen like you want it too-ooh

Now you know, I'm really glad
I listened to my mum and dad
But still I took the chances that I ha-a-a-ad
But someday when I'm old and grey
Now my dreams have gone away
And know that I smile, and it's good to remember

It's up to you, you can be all that you wanna be (wanna be-ee)
Just see it throu-ou-ou-ough
For it will happen like you want it to-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Want it to, want it to) woh-oh-oh-oh
It's up to you, you can be all that you wanna be (wanna be-ee)
Just see it throu-ou-ou-ough
For it will happen like you want it to-ooh
(Want it to, want it to)
It's up to you, you can be all that you wanna be (wanna be-ee)
Just see it throu-ou-ou-ough
(Fade)
