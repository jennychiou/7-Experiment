Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you bound me, you bound me

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realise the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in (You were right there)
So shame on me now (You were right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been(Oh)
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
