When life gives you lemons
They pour down from the heavens
This is what you've got to do
Make some lemonade
Drink it in the shade
Don't let a bad day get to you

You got no money to your name
But all you need is heart anyway

You can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love

When you get suspicions
That someone wants your wishes
Even more than you do
Don't waste your time fighting
Better spend it finding
What you really want for you

You don't need money and you don't need fame
'Cause all you need is heart anyway

You can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love

No, you can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love

Without love we would be blind
There'd be no kindness in the world
There would be no girl
There'd be no boy
There would be no joy

You got no money to your name
But all you need is heart anyway
You can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love

No you can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love

I said you can't buy love
But you can make it
Oh you can't make sunshine
But you can make love
