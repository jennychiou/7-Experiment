We will meet again beneath the star
I think of you each day
I feel you close wherever you are
I know you'll find your way

Let the Christmas lights warm your heart tonight
Let them guide you home from the cold
May your hope conquer fear at this time of the year
May you never be alone

There's a place I go a horizon of home
Where all our dreams are saved
I can feel you close wherever you are
Till you're in my arms again

Let the Christmas lights warm your heart tonight
Let them guide you home from the cold
May your hope conquer fear at this time of the year
May you never be alone

Let the Christmas lights warm your heart tonight
Let them guide you home from the cold
May your hope conquer fear at this time of year
May you never be alone

May your hope conquer fear at this time of the year
May you never be alone
