'Case you never look back
I want you to know that you were loved like mad
I hope you live long enough, to change your mind

Where do you think you're going
I want to go with you, can I come too
Nobody knows you better
Nobody loves you quite like I do

'Case you ever look twice
Over your shoulder, know I'm on your side
If you ever open your eyes, even one more time

Where do you think you're going
I want to go with you, can I come too
Nobody knows you better
Nobody loves you quite like I do

I wish you the best
I hope you have it all
But if you should fall from grace
I'll be waiting at the bottom for you

Where do you think you're going
I want to go with you, can I come too
Nobody knows you better
Nobody loves you, not like I do

I do, love you
