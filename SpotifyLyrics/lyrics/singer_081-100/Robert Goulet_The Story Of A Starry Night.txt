This is the story of a starry night
The faded glory of a new delight
Long breathless meetings, two lips repeating
Sweet precious words that were sweet, but fleeting

When stars are bright my heart keeps wondering why
Our first "goodnight" became our last "goodbye"
I pray that someday love will in some way
Bring back the story of a starry night
