Bring night, bring the night on
Bring a little bit of dance, bring a little bit of song
Bring night, bring the night on
I'm not sure I can wait yeah this day just feels so long
Bring night, bring the night on
The music gets into me and I know it can't be wrong
Bring night, bring the night on
'Cause all that we are after is a little bit of fun

Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Bring night, bring the night on
Bring me the moon and stars, let's send away the sun
Bring night, bring the night on
And maybe if I'm lucky, I'll end up in your arms

Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Instrumental

Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down,
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
