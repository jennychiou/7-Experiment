Let's sit down and talk it over, take my shoulder tonight
Look at me and tell me what is on your mind, this time
Gonna stay here till you got
A smile on your face
I'm here no matter what
Everything else can wait

Let's kiss and make up now
Let's kiss and make love
Can't wait another minute
Let's go with this
Kiss me and let's make up now

Let's be honest let's be open we're not broken, not yet
It's not easy trying to please me
I'm not perfect, I know that I'm gonna stay here till you've got
A smile on your face
I'm here no matter what
Everything else can wait

Let's kiss and make up now
Let's kiss and make love
Can't wait another minute
Let's go with this
Kiss me and let's make up now

Talk to me, it's alright I'm open
Hold on tight, we're not broken, not broken
I know that we can do this
Come baby do it, right now
 
Let's kiss and make up now
Let's kiss and make love
Can't wait another minute
Let's go with this
Kiss me and let's make up now

Come on, kiss me and let's make up now
Kiss me and let's make up now
