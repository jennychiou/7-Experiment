How you been feeling
It's not about marbles, snakes or glue
How you been healing
Now that we cannot win or lose
So how you been keeping
It doesn't matter whose dad's richest now
How you been sleeping
From the top bunks further to fall down

You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me

What you been doing
Still making the world a better place
Never stopped rueing
Making those tears fall down your face
Making you suffer
Wondering how you got your scars
And only in hindsight
I wish I had taken you in my arms

Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms

You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me (Forgiving the bully)
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me (Forgiving the bully)
