The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like
A wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turn black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
And the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away
All my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
Think that I am finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally clean
