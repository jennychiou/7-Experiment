I had given up
I didn't know who to trust, oh
So I designed a shell
Kept me from heaven and hell, oh

Yeah, I had hit a low
Was all I let myself know, yeah
Yeah, I had locked my heart
I was imprisoned by God

You found me dressed in black
Hiding where I put the past
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses

I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignore my pride
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You calmed my fears, you really had
And you covered my heart in kisses

I was down for the count
'Cause I was down, I was out, ooh
And I had lost it all
'Cause I was scared I was done, oh

And I took to the night
I'd given into the fight, oh ooh
And I slipped further down
Yeah, I felt like I drowned

You found me dressed in black
Hiding where I put the past
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses

I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignore my pride
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You calmed my fears, you really had
And you covered my heart in kisses

I was hopeless and more
Then you opened the door from me
Yeah, I was hiding and you let the light in 
And now I see

Had to do for the wounded
What they couldnâ€™t seem to, you set them free
Like a butterfly kiss
And a child with an eye for the minor key, oh yeah

You found me dressed in black
Hiding where I put the past
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses

I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignore my pride
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You calmed my fears, you really had
And you covered my heart in kisses

Cover my heart in kisses
