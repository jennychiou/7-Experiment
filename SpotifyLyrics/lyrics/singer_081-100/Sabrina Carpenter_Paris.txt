If I ask that boy to jump, I know he would
He don't even have to say, it's understood
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Someone told me that he's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian hot, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah

It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
Yeah, I already have love in LA

If you show me too much love, it makes me leave
Guess it's one of many things that's wrong with me
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore
Why'd it take so long for me to know this?
Scared to put the water with the roses
Halfway across the world for me to know this
But I know this, yeah I know this, yeah

It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA

Je ne voulais pas trouver l'ammour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionément
Mon coeur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart

It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA (Already have love)
It's so romantic in Paris (So romantic in Paris)
Won't even try to compare it (I know that I try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
But I already have love in LA
