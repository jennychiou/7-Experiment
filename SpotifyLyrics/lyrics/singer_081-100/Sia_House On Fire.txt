I don't like to wait too long
To wait too long, wait too long
Bring it on and bring it strong
Bring it baby

I knew it would
Your heart burns through
I feel the pain and I cry out
I cry out
I need you
I need you

Babe, boy I'm gonna drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
Boy I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah you're to blame

Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning

So take me to the heavens now
As we burn down, as we are found
Take me to the heavens now
My heart screams out
I need you

Babe, boy I'm gonna drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby I'm a house on fire
