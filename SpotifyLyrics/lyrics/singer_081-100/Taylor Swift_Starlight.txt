I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I'm a Barbie on the boardwalk
Summer of '45
Picked me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen
And crazy, running wild, wild

Can't remember what song
It was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said "Look at you, worrying too much about,
Things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that away."

He was trying to skip rocks
On the ocean saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
