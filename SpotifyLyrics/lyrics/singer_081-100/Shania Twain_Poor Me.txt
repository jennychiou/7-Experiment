Found it in his closet, right behind the lies
I wish I never saw it, the secret in his eyes
Poor me

He never told me how long, I'd been living in the dark
No one turned the light on, I fell and broke my heart
Poor me, poor me 

Poor me this, poor me that
Why do I keep looking back
Poor me this, poor me that
It's not white, it's not black
Grey's the colour that I see
Still can't believe he'd leave me to love her
Pour me, another

Tried to face it, but so far down inside
I just can't shake it, my stupid pride
Poor me, poor me

Poor me this, poor me that
Why do I keep looking back
Poor me this, poor me that
It's not white, it's not black
Grey's the colour that I see
Still can't believe he'd leave me to love her
Pour me, another

I know it should get better
Oh but it never does
I wish he'd never met her
Then everything would be the way it was

Poor me this, poor me that
Poor me this, poor me that
Oh poor me this, poor me that
Why do I keep looking back
Poor me this, poor me that
It's not white, it's not black
Grey's the colour that I see
I still cant believe that he'd leave me, to love her

Poor me
Pour me, another
