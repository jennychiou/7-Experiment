No, think you got your break?
I'm the sugar mama, I'm the piggy bank
Tell me what you think nah, nah, nah
Stacking bills and counting change
I'm the Rockefeller, I'm not what you think no way nah, nah, nah

I'm your new money
Dropping all on your cruise
Spend too soon, money
One percent I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth honey, that's what I'm worth, worth, worth

I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever, oh no

Money don't buy class, and I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever

Steal my heart, and steal my kiss
But you can't check my balances, no can't do nah, nah, nah
No can do nah, nah, nah
And I'll take you out, and I'll take you in
This love is my weakness nah, nah

I'm your new money (new money)
Drop it all on your cruise
Spend too soon, money
One percent I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth honey, that's what I'm worth, worth, worth

I am a diamond (Diamond babe), and diamonds are forever (they're forever-ever)
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever, oh no

Money don't buy class, and I can't be bought like that, like that
Don't buy class nah, nah, nah
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever, oh nah, nah, nah

(Diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds)
Diamonds are forever baby
(Diamonds, diamonds)
What you tryna do for me darling?
(Diamonds, diamonds)
I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you

I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever
No they're forever, no you know

Money don't buy class, and I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever

(Diamonds, diamonds)
Diamonds baby, diamonds oh no
(Diamonds, diamonds)
Know your love, these diamonds are yours
(Diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds)
I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you
