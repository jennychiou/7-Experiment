Well, he shines like a penny in a little kid's hand
When he's out on a Saturday night
He's a real go-getter and the best two-stepper you'll see
But when I'm sittin' alone at a table for two
'Cause he's already out on the floor
I think about somethin' that my mama used to say to me

You gotta dance with the one that brought you
And stay with the one that wants you
The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let the moon get to ya
Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong

He's got his old best buddies and his new best friends
And the girls all give him the eye
He's a good time Charlie and the life of the party tonight
But when I think about another, well I don't think twice
'Cause there'll never be another like him
I know he really loves me and I think maybe mama was right

You gotta dance with the one that brought you
And stay with the one that wants you
The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let the moon get to ya
Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong

You've gotta dance with the one that brought you
And you can't go wrong
