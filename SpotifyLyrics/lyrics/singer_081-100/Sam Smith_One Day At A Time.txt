Let's turn off our phones tonight
And rely on the stars
We've been so lost lately
We forgot who we are

But I got everything I need, baby
In the palms of your touch
In a world of dark distractions
It can all get too much

So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?

We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

I know you're feeling weighed down tonight
And you can't find the breaks
Every day is too long for you
You are sworn to your fate

But we got everything we need, baby
In the memories we make
In a world of reinventions
It's never too late

So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?

We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

Oh, so let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
There is nothing that we've done wrong
That can't be made right

We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
