I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away... just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Forget forever
Forget forever
