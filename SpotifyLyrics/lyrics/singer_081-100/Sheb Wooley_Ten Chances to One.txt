I can hear my phone ringing and I'm sitting near by
Trying to decide what to do
Oh I would like to say hello and hear your voice say I love you
But ten chances to one it's not even you

If I answer and it is you and there's someone there with you
I could tell it then I'd know that we're through
Oh I would like to say hello and hear your voice say I need you
But ten chances to one he's right there with you

I don't think I could stand to hear somebody laughin'
'Cause I'd know that he holds you as I used to do
Oh I love you more than ever and I'll just take the gamble
Ten chances to one he's right there with you
Ten chances to one he's right there with you
