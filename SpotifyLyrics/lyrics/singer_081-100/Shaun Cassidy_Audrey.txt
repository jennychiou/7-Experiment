Silent, she wakes up and ponders the day
Takin' her ti-i-ime, feeling her way
Everything is okay in her wor-orld
My life - of which she is so much a part
Has found a new mome-ent, found a new start
And deep in my heart I know-ow
 
That its Audrey
Lighting my life with her smi-ile
Looking through the eyes of a chi-i-ild
And turning my days into ni-ights
I-if not for Audrey
There would be nothing to share-are
There would be no reason to care-are-are
God only knows where I'd be-ee-ee
 
Maybe it's crazy-y, but I've never felt this way before
Never been broke-en, 'cause I've never been sure
Of a love so obscure - yesterday-ay
But ti-i-ime - which change is so much a part
Has opened my eye-eye-eyes, found a new start
And deep in my heart I know-ow
 
That its Audrey
Lighting my life with her smi-ile
Looking through the eyes of a chi-i-ild
And turning my days into ni-ights
I-if not for Audrey
There would be nothing to share-are
And there would be no reason to care-are-are
And God only knows where I'd be, yeah-eah-eah-eah
 
If not for Audrey-ey
Lighting my life with her smi-ile
I'm looking through the eyes of a chi-i-ild
And God only knows where I'd be-ee-ee
Without Au-audrey
 
If not for Audrey-ey
Lighting my li-i-ife
If not for Au-audrey-ey-ey
Lighting my life...
