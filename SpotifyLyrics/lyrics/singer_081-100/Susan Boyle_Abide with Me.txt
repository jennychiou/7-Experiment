Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;
Heavens morning breaks, and earths vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
