Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
And if I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I guess I never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give, please give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I guess I never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
