It's dangerous to fall in love
But I wanna burn with you tonight, hurt me
There's two of us bristling with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire, burn me

So come on, I'll take you on, take you on
I ache for love, ache for us
Why don't you come
Don't you come a little closer?

So come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame you came for me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline

I got all I need when you came after me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight

And we will fly like smoke darkening the sky
I'm Eve, I want to try, take a bite

So come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame you came for me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline

I got all I need when you came after me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight

But it's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I gotta get it
When the fire dies, darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left

But it's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I gotta get it
When the fire dies, darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left

Flame you came for me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline

I got all I need when you came after me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight

Burn with me tonight, burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight, eh eh
