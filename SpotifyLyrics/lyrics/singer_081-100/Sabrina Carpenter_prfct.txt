Hey, hey, hey, hey
No, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Oh no
You can get real close, talking, you're talking now
Underneath our clothes, pretending we know it all
Shut off the light just to hide in the dark, dark, dark
Hide in the dark, dark, dark
Think I know you the farther you are

Like, A-B-C-D that can work so perfectly
If perfect was the kinda thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel in love, just a little bit of the age
Wanna feel, feel, feel
Even if I know that I'll will end up in a maze

Like aye, aye, aye, aye, aye it won't be perfect
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh it could be worth it
And for all the nights, tears running down my face
Messing up my mascara
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye but maybe that's what we need
That's what we need

See went through the friction, and all of this figuring
All of this figuring
Just give me some friction, let me see what nobody sees
Nobody sees
You don't think that I can handle the turn?
Handle the truth, handle the truth
Baby I'm over just playing it cool, oh

Like, A-B-C-D that can work so perfectly
If perfect was the kinda thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel in love, just a little bit of the age
Wanna feel, feel, feel
Even if I know that I'll will end up in a maze

Like aye, aye, aye, aye, aye it won't be perfect
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh it could be worth it
And for all the nights, tears running down my face
Messing up my mascara
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye but maybe that's what we need
That's what we need

That's what we need
(That's what we need)
That's what we need
(That's what we need)
Baby don't you think you can give it to me
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby don't you think you can give it to me

Like aye, aye, aye, aye, aye it won't be perfect
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh it could be worth it
And for all the nights, tears running down my face
Messing up my mascara
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye but maybe that's what we need
That's what we need
Like aye, aye, aye, aye, aye it won't be perfect
But I know oh, oh, oh, oh it could be worth it
And for all the nights, tears running down my face
Messing up my mascara
It's not perfect aye, aye, aye but maybe that's what we need
That's what we need
