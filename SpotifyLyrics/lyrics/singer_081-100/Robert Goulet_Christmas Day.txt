Christmas Day is here and so are we
Time for children and presents
And Christmas tree happiness

Christmas Day is all that it should be
Lights and carols and holly
And all kinds of loveliness

Christmas bells ringing out goodwill to men and peace on earth
Ev'rything they taught you when you were a child
The things a child once taught the world

If Christmas day is really in your heart
You don't have to save up all your love to give once a year
Learn to give, try to live each day like Christmas Day

If Christmas day is really in your heart
You don't have to save up all your love to give once a year
Learn to give, try to live each day like Christmas Day
