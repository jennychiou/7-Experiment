So you wonder why I sit alone and fret and watch the telephone
A fool I'm hopin' she might call and say she loves me after all
She just left me day before yesterday there's no reason for me
To pretend that it's all right with me to spend these lonely nights
What did I do to upset it it just ain't right and I don't get it
Hurts to have a heart that hurts for someone else that's why she left
Right as rain it plain ain't right she left me all this pain
And I say right is right and left is lonely

So you wonder why I sit and fret and watch the TV colored set
Well that might help me not to forget to remember not to get upset
How can I get her off of my mind when everywhere I look I find
Some little thing that she held dear but not too dear 'cause she ain't here
What did I do to upset her she left me flat and if I don't get her back
I think I'll go insane for all this pain and that's a shame
A right she left me by myself and went off with somebody else
And I say right is right and left is lonely
Yeah I say right is right and left is lonely
