It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
The smiles
The flowers
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go
Tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me
