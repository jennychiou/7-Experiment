Old father time
You and me and holiday wine
Wait for the snow
While we read the lists that they wrote

Sitting by the open fire
Loving you's a gift tonight
Loving you for all my life
Loving you's the gift tonight

Everyday is Christmas when you're here with me
I'm safe in your arms
You're my angel baby
Everyday is Christmas when you're by my side
You're the gift that keeps giving
My angel for life

Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
With you by my side
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
With you by my side

Oh you're my love
You're the joy in my holiday song
And when you smile
I can't breathe
Can't believe that you're mine

Sitting by the open fire
Loving you's a gift tonight
Loving you for all my life
Loving you's the gift tonight

Everyday is Christmas when you're here with me
I'm safe in your arms
You're my angel baby
Everyday is Christmas when you're by my side
You're the gift that keeps giving
My angel for life

Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
With you by my side
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
With you by my side
