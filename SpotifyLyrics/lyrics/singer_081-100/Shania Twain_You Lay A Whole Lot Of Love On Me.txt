I can feel your body tugging gently on my mind
Stirring up a feeling I though I'd never find
Ever since I met you, babe, I've been living in a dream
You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me

I get warm all over when you get close to me
Then I start to tremble from my head down to my feet
I become your piece of clay to do with what you please
You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me

You lay a whole lot of love on me
A love I though could never be
Let the whole world fall apart, you're all I'll ever need.
You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me

You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me
