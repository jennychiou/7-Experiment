Rollin' the dice
And bankin' on a second chance
In the land of the jaded romance
Riding a dream
Steering a passion
For your heart
I'm givin' you what's left of mine
Leavin' only the words behind
Lost in the crowd

I was losin' my mind
And I knew it was time for a change
I had to stop and rearrange
'Cause I knew it was time for a change
I had to find another way

I was wakin' up mortified
With my back to the wall
I was givin' it all to the wind
Only never satisfied
Now you're here
And it's clear
That you've made it
A time for a change

Too many times
I'd seem to get the best of me
I'd give it all to fantasy
Chasin' the night
Chasin' illusion
For your heart
I'm givin' you what's left of mine
Leavin' only the words behind
Lost in the crowd
