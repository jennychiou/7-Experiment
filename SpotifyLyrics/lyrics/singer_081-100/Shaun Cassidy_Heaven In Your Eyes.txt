Magic touched my life
The moment that you smiled
The world began for me
You unlocked my heart
And all the feelings there
I never thought I could see

Heaven in your eyes
It's just to good to be true
Heaven in your eyes
I've never been so high
Heaven in your eyes
Nobody does what you do
With just one look
And I can touch the sky

No more lonely nights
Not since you came along
And filled these dreams of mine
You chased away the clouds
And kissed away my tears
And told the sun where to shine

Heaven in your eyes
It's just to good to be true
Heaven in your eyes
I've never been so high
Heaven in your eyes
Nobody does what you do
With just one look
And I can touch the sky
