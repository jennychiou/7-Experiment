There's a lonely lover in the world tonight
Who dreams of roses by candlelight
Yet the one she lives for doesn't understand
What her heart is saying, what her love demands

Can you feel it?
It's about to start
Can you hear it?
It's a voice inside my heart
That's always calling your name
Can you hear it?

So your life is better than it's ever been
But the evolution has stopped within
If I only tell you what you want to hear
You'll keep avoiding what you really fear
You'll keep avoiding what you really fear

Can you feel it?
It's about to start
Can you hear it?
It's a voice inside my heart
That's always calling your name
Can you hear it?

Tell me how long, how long
For my heart song, for my heart song?
Tell me can you hear it? Tell me how long
For my heart song, for my heart song
I'll keep waiting, 'cause it won't be long
For my heart song, for my heart song

Love is a heart song that's shared by two
Do you hear the music that I feel for you?

Can you hear it?
It's about to start
Can you feel it?
It's a voice inside my heart
That's always calling your name
Can you hear it?

Tell me how long, how long
For my heart song, for my heart song?
Tell me can you hear it? Tell me how long
For my heart song, for my heart song?
I'll keep waiting, 'cause it won't be long
Till my heart song, for my heart song

How long? Lonely, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, lonely, lonely, how long?
