Me and a bottle of wine and a cheap hotel

Broken windowpanes and dirty rooftops for my view
Oh I've come a long way down since losing you
I've got all it takes to make my life a hell
Me and a bottle of wine and a cheap hotel

Jingled jangled nerves they make me walk the floor
I've lost the one I love forever more
With no one else but four drab walls to tell
Me and a bottle of wine and a cheap hotel

Sometimes I go downstairs and try the phone
Although I know for me there's no one home
These unsure hands they tremble when I pour the wine
It won't stop it won't stop until I petrify my mind

Tell all the friends we had I'm doing well
Me and a bottle of wine and a cheap hotel
Just me and a bottle of wine and a cheap hotel
