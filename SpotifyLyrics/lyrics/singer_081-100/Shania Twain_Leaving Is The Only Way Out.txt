I'm not sayin' I have all the answers
And I don't care who's right or wrong
I'm tryin' to pick up the pieces already fallen
And put them back where they belong

So slow down your horses
Stop draggin' me around
And if cryin' is the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out

We've slammed every door in anger
And we've opened wounds we can't mend
And one night lonely is one night too many
Don't wanna wake up to one more night that won't end

So slow down your horses
Stop draggin' me around
And if cryin' is the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out

When late nights and long lies came knockin'
You just invited them in
And our voices got too loud for talkin'
Then my heart hit the floor
But your feet just kept walkin'

And if cryin' is the only way you hear me hurtin'
For the lovin' that I can't live without
And if lovin' ain't the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out

Oh, leavin' is the only way out
