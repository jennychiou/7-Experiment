Lay down your arms
I don't wanna fight anymore
Rough seas will be calm
Hold on while we weather the storm

We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our love's not worth playing chicken with

I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance

This too shall pass
We're right where we're meant to be
There's things I don't ask
What I don't know can't hurt me

We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our love's not worth playing chicken with

I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance

I'm not discarding you like broken glass
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
