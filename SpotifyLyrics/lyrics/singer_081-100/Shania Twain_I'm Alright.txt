You let me go
You had to have her
You told me slow
I died faster
Than I could know, love would ever kill

You said take care
Don't be sad girl
Life's not fair
It's a mad world
But I'm not mad, I've already downed that pill

I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay
I'm alright tonight
Oh I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay
I'm alright for now

I broke down
All you did was stand there
Without a sound
It came from nowhere
The truth so loud
Oh my heart stood still

I was not your dream
The one you wanted
I tried to scream
But silence haunted
Me in my sleep
Oh and probably always will 

I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay
I'm alright tonight
Oh I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay
I'm alright for now

No one comes undone the way I do
When it comes to you
And who knows, how close
I was to the end but I got back up again
Oh I'm still breathing
I'm alright, I'm all I'm all, gonna be okay
I'm alright, I'm alright. I'm gonna be I'm ma m'alright

I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay
I'm alright tonight
Oh I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay
I'm alright for now
