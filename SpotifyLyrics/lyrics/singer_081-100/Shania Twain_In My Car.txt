When we're watchin' the TV
Oh, babe--it's okay
And you can pick the flavor
When we're orderin' ice cream
I don't mind--yeah, that's fine
I'd do--hoo--hoo--
Anything for you--hoo--hoo

Ah, it's all right if you sleep with
Your socks on--oh, babe! It's okay!
And you can hurt my head with
Your favorite rock song
I don't mind--yeah, that's fine

For you--hoo--hoo--there's
Nothin' that I wouldn't do--hoo--hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe

But in my car--I'll be the driver
In my car--I'm in control
In my car--I come alive and
In my car--I am the driver--
Watch me now!

You can blame me when you run outta
Razors--oh, babe--it's okay!
And I will run around when
You ask me for favors--
I don't mind--that's fine

For you--hoo--hoo--There's nothin'
That I wouldn't do--hoo--hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe

But in my car--I'll be the driver
In my car--I'm in control
In my car--I come alive and
In my car--I am the driver--
Watch me now!

The strong one, yeah
Oh, babe! It's okay!
And you can have your way, honey,
Even when you're wrong
I don't mind! Yeah, that's fine!

For you--hoo--hoo--There's nothin'
That I wouldn't do--hoo--hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe

But in my car--I'll be the driver
In my car--I'm in control
In my car--I come alive and
In my car--I am the driver--
Watch me now!

Not you--hoo--hoo, not you--hoo--
Hoo, not you--hoo--hoo
