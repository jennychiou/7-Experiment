Taking my time, nothing comes easily
I focus my mind on walking the other way
If you can stay there and there's nothing you can say
I don't care
If you think you can put on that face it's a little too late for that

'Cause baby stars shine bright without you
My heart fights without you
The world don't turn around you
And I can breathe without you
Breathe without you
I can breathe without you
I find peace without you
And I still breathe without you

I was so blind it's hard to blame anyone
Looking back now I should've seen where you are
But you were so good I'm thinking and I wish that I could
Go back and look at you with eyes open
Not fall and be broken now, baby

Stars shine bright without you
My heart fights without you
The world don't turn around you
And I can breathe without you
Breathe without you
I can breathe without you
I find peace without you
And I still breathe without you

Stars shine bright without you
My heart fights without you
The world don't turn around you
And I can breathe without you

Taking my time, nothing comes easily, oh

Stars shine bright without you
My heart fights without you
The world don't turn around you
And I can breathe without you
Breathe without you
Breathe without you, oh
I find peace without you
And I still breathe without you

Stars shine bright without you
My heart fights without you
The world don't turn around you
I can breathe without you
