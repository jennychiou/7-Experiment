The cattle are prowlin' the coyotes are howlin'
Out with the doggies bawl
His spurs are jinglin' the cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call

Uh uh huh huh uh uh...

He rides in the sun till his day's work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Uh uh huh huh singin' the cattle call

For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call

Uh uh huh huh uh uh...

He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an old western drawl
Uh uh huh huh singin' this cattle call

Uh uh huh huh uh uh...
