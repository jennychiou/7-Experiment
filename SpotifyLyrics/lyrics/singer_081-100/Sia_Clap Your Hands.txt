Neglecting the good things

The good things

Just let me out of my misery

(Oh oh whoa)

(Oh oh)

On a night like this...
Get out of misery

(Oh oh)

Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life
And we only get one chance


Clap your Hands
Clap Your Hands
Come on dance
Take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at this


Clap your Hands
