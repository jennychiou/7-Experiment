You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
