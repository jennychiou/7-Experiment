Take my arm, take my head
Make your mark like a man
Write your name, gonna write your name
Hurts so good, love and pain
When all fades, you remain
Write your name, gonna write your name

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart

Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name

Permanent, leave your scar
When you're gone, you' re never far
Write your name, gonna write your name
Cover me, all you are, over me, your signature
Write your name, gonna write your name

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart

It's your name across my heart
Written in gold, a permanent mark
Let em' graved, It's what we are,
More than words, this love is art
Poetry emotion, put it right there
Deeper than skin, crystal clear
Letters don't fade, titanium made
Forever here, forever saved
Write your name, across my heart

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name
