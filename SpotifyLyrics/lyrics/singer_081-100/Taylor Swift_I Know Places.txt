"(I, I, I, I)" I
"(I, I, I, I)" I

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as they pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vulture circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run
Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They take their shots, we're bulletproof
"(I know places)"
And you know for me it's always you
"(I know places)"
And you're dead at night, your eyes so grey
"(I know places)"
And I know for you it's always me
"(I know places)"

"(I, I, I, I)" I
"(I, I, I, I)" I
