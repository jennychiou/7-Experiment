Frosted windowpanes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree

Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
"Merry Christmas
May your new year dreams come true"

And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing, too

It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
"Merry Christmas
May your new year dreams come true"

And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing, too
