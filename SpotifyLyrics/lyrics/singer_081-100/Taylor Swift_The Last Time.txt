(Gary Lightbody)
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better.

(Both)
Right before your eyes,
I'm breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

(Taylor Swift)
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

(Both)
Right before your eyes,
I'm aching
Run fast, nowhere to hide,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list.
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

(Taylor Swift)
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,

(Gary Lightbody)
This is the last time I say "It's been you all along."

(Taylor Swift)
This is the last time I let you in my door

(Gary Lightbody)
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-oh, oh-oh

(Both)
Oh-oh, oh-oh.

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

(Taylor Swift)
This is the last time I'm asking you this

(Gary Lightbody)
This is the last time I'm asking you this

(Taylor Swift)
Put my name at the top of your list

(Gary Lightbody)
Put my name at the top of your list

(Taylor Swift)
This is the last time I'm asking you why

(Gary Lightbody)
This is the last time I'm asking you why

(Taylor Swift)
You broke my heart in the blink of an eye

(Gary Lightbody)
You break my heart

(Both)
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
