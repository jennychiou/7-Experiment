I love it when you talk to me
I love it when you talk to me
But you're afraid to walk with me
Through the storm
It's like heaven
Through the storm
It's like heaven
Where will it ever end
Where will it ever end
 
Don't take this thrill away from me
You know our love was meant to be
The way it should truly be
Every day
It's like heaven
Every day
It's like heaven
When will it ever end
When will it ever end

For so long, so long I've waited for this feeling
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be with you tonight
And to kiss you tonight
 
For so long, so long I held onto this feeling
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be with you tonight
And to kiss you tonight
 
I love it when you talk to me
It's like heaven
I love it when you talk to me
It's like heaven
Where will it ever end
Where will it ever end
 
Don't take this feeling away from me
It's like heaven
You know our love was meant to be
It's like heaven
When will it ever end
When will it ever end
 
It's like heaven
It's like heaven
