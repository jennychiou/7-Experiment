You're my bad boy fairytale
Since jamming with the dark side
I wanna be your bad girl
You bring out my wild side
Your eyes your lips your touch
His talk, sadistic rush, your sexy kinda swag
The best I've ever had

Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up but I'm loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody doe-doe-doe
No I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I can't go back, no, I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I can't go back, no, I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was

You're my bad boy fairytale
My rebel with a halo
You hit me like a hurricane
And I can never say no
Your mind you hands your voice
The way you make me yours, you
Your sexy kinda swag
The best I've ever had

Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up but I'm loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody doe-doe-doe
No I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I can't go back, no, I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I can't go back, no, I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was (to the way it was)

I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my wild side
I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my dark side

Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up but I'm loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody doe-doe-doe
No I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I can't go back, no, I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I can't go back, no, I can't go back to the way it was, to the way it was (to the way it was)

I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my wild side
