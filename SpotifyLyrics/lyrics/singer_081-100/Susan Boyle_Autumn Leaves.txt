Autumn leaves under frozen souls,
Hungry hands turning soft and old,
My hero cried as we stood out there in the cold,
Like these autumn leaves I don't have nothing to hold.

Handsome smile, wearing handsome shoes,
Too young to say, though I swear he knew,
And I hear him singing while he sits there in his chair,
While these autumn leaves float around everywhere.

I look at you, and I see me,
Making noise so restlessly,
But now its quiet and I can hear you saying,
'My little fish don't cry, my little fish don't cry.'

Autumn leaves have faded now,
That smile I lost, well I've found somehow,
'Cause you still live on in my fathers eyes,

These autumn leaves,
Oh these autumn leaves,
Oh these autumn leaves are yours tonight
