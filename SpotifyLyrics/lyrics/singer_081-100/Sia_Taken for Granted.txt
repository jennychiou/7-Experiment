I'm sitting in the car again
Waiting for you
You said you'd be a minute
But you've been twenty two
See you've got to do your hair
And get it just right
Sometimes you're in the bathroom
For half of the night

And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do

Now I'm sitting by the phone again
Waiting for your call
You said you'd phone at two
And it's a quarter past four
Now I'm standing out the front again
It's late at night
And I'm truly sick to death of sleazy men
Undressing me with their eyes

And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do

So I'm back from the theater
I watched the show alone
See, I waited for you and I missed half act one
Have you never heard of the phone?
I don't like being taken for granted
I'm too nice for my own good
You see I do what I say, and I say what I do
Is it too much to expect that you could?
I wish you would

I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
It's the usual coup
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't missing nothing for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool
