Over worked and underpaid
The husband carries on his trade
Working hard nine to five
A corporate example of the middle class staying alive

Safe at home his lovely wife
With whom he shared a simple life
Suddenly finds she's needing more
Longing for the love that died so many years before

She was seventeen, he was twenty one
A virgin till the day that she was married young
So incomplete
Break for the street
Oh break for the street
Oh break for the street

And so she runs into the night
Believing all that once was right
Trying hard to understand
She finds herself collapsing in the arms of another man

She was thirty six and he was twenty one
Before it began it was over and done
So incomplete
Break for the street
Oh break for the street
Oh break for the street
Break for the street

Oh break for the street

Oh break for the street

Oh break for the street

Oh break for the street

Break for it
