You got a hold on me
You're standing over me
Sometimes I hardly breathe at all
I need a little room
I need a lot of moon
I got to find it soon or I'll fall
Into the emptiness
Into the dark abyss
Too deep to climb the walls
Sometimes I want to flee
But that could never be
You got a hold on me

You got a hold on me
And I'm dancing to your song
You got a hold on me
And it's my heart you're holding on

You got the sweetest smile
You got a certain style
And I can never get enough
Of the way you move
And the way we groove
When it's feeling right to the touch
Then you turn around
And you stomp me down
And you want to call it love
You know it makes me bleed
But I could never leave
You got a hold on me

You got a hold on me
And I'm dancing to your song
You got a hold on me
And it's my heart you're holding on

You got a hold on me
I keep dancing to your song
You got a hold on me
And it's my heart you're holding on
