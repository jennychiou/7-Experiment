Someone plugged you in
Then, sadly, they clipped your wings
You can't fly away, electric bird
Yeah, someone took your tweet
One day fed you that bad seed
You can't fly away, electric bird

Well, you're art
You fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly, holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered 'round the yard making your magic

Got to set you free
You were blinded by deceit
You can't fly away, electric bird
So now this room's your stage
While you're stuck there in that cage
You can't fly away, electric bird

Well, you're art
You fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly, holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered 'round the yard making your magic

Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
You're art
You fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly, holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered 'round the yard making your magic
