I don't wanna wear that
It only makes me look fat
Time to tone my thighs-- gotta lose another size, yeah!
What a way to wanna be

Exfoliate--look great!
Feel guilty 'bout what you ate
You're buyin' all the books--
To learn the latest looks, yeah
What a way to wanna be

We like to buy, we like to spend,
To keep up with the latest trend
But we don't get no satisfaction
Living like a slave to fashion
No more thinking for yourself,
Just get it off a shelf

Oh--oh, why be perfect--no--oh,
It's not worth it
Don't be so obsessed--c'mon give it a rest
This is not some contest--just do your best
'Cause no--oh body's perfect!
What a way to wanna be

Moisturize, exercise, erase the
Rings around your eyes
Cover what you can,
Get a Coppertone tan, yeah
What a way to wanna be!

Stabilize the mood you're in--
You're back on diet food again
Bigger is the best, but only
In the chest, yeah!
What a way to wanna be

We like to buy, we like to spend,
To keep up with the latest trend
But we don't get no satisfaction
Living like a slave to fashion
No more thinking for yourself,
Just get it off a shelf

Oh--oh, why be perfect--no--oh,
It's not worth it
Don't be so obsessed--c'mon give it a rest
This is not some contest--just do your best
'Cause no--oh body's perfect!
What a way to wanna be

It's so very--unnecessary
Yeah, how insane--to be so vain
It's so synthetic--I just don't get it
I don't get it, baby, yeah, yeah

Don't be so obsessed--c'mon give it a rest
This is not some contest--just do your best
'Cause no--oh body's perfect!

(Ooh)

Oh, no--oh body's perfect
No--oh, it's not worth it
Don't be so obsessed
(No--oh body's perfect)
This is not some contest
(No--oh body's perfect)
Perfect! What a way to wanna be
