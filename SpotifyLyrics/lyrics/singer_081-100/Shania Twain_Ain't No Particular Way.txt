(Here it comes
Mmm, the thing about love)

Love has a way to find ya
Sneaks up right behind ya
There ain't no particular way
You don't know when it's gonna
Come runnin' 'round the corner
There ain't no particular way
So, don't give up (don't give up on love till you get your share)--
You're gonn get your share
The thing about love (The thing about love is it's)--is that it's everywhere

There ain't nowhere it won't hide
(There ain't nowhere it won't hide)
There ain't no speed it won't drive
(There ain't no speed in won't drive)
There ain't no law it won't break
(There ain't no law it won't break)
There ain't no chance it won't take
There ain't no, no particular way

Oh, it could come so fast it fools ya
Might take its time to move ya
There ain't no particular way
It might just drift in while you're dreaming
It don't sleep, always schemin'
There ain't no particular way

So, don't give up (don't give up
On love till you get your share)--
You're gonna get your share
The thing about love (The thing about
Love is it's)--is that it's everywhere

There ain't nowhere it won't hide
(There ain't nowhere it won't hide)
There ain't no speed it won't drive
(There ain't no speed in won't drive)
There ain't no law it won't break
(There ain't no law it won't break)
There ain't no chance it won't take
There ain't no, no particular way

You can't hide, oh
(There ain't no time) It comes when you least expect it--
(There ain't no day)
When you thought you'd been rejected
(There ain't no how) (There ain't no way)
There ain't no particular way
(There ain't no why)
Love ain't for just the lucky
(There ain't no when)
It's there for everybody
(There ain' no what)
There ain't no particular way
(There ain't no way)

So, don't give up (don't give up on love till you get your share)--
You're gonna get your share
The thing about love (The thing about
Love is it's)--is that it's everywhere

There ain't nowhere it won't hide
(There ain't nowhere it won't hide)
There ain't no speed it won't drive
(There ain't no speed in won't drive)
There ain't no law it won't break
(There ain't no law it won't break)
There ain't no chance it won't take
There ain't no, no particular way

(There ain't no time) yeah, yeah, yeah
(There ain't no day)
(There ain't no how) There ain't no way
(There ain't no when) There ain't no time
(There ain't no what) (There ain't no way)
Oh, there ain't no way!
