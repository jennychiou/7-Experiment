I regret that I told the world
That you were with me
And I regret how I showed the world
That you were pretty

I never thought I'd learn so much
So much from being lonely
But I guess I didn't learn enough
'Cause now you won't hold me

I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all

And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all
In the thrill of it all

Even though we weren't in love
It was far from lust
Yeah, you were beautiful
But in you I could trust

Others, they warned my heart
They said I would lose fast
They said that you were stopping ground
And soon to be my past

I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all

And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all, oh
In the thrill of it all

And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all
