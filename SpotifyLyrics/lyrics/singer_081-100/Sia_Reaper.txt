Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I'd be found before I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping, saw you sneaking
In the shadows long, the fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye

Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
Let me savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
And I remember when...

You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gate
But no baby, no baby not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper!
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper!
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby not today

So come back when I'm good and old
I got drinks to drink and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life, yeah
Oh, I want to dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair and hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah

Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
Let me savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
And I remember when...

You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby not today

Reaper
Reaper
Reaper
