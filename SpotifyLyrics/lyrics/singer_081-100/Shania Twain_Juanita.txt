She is the restless river running through my veins
She rides without the reins-- her name's Juanita
She lives in the heart of every woman in the world
Within the reach of every girl who wants to meet her

(She's gonna be ridin' through)
Her name's Juanita
(She's gonna be ridin' free) She's ridin' free
(She's gonna be inside of you, gonna be inside of me)
She's inside of you and inside of me, yeah

Oh, go with her-- flow with her
Dream with her-- scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
If you can find her and free her
Juanita will unchain your heart

When someone tries to take away the freedom of your choice
To take away your voice--
That's when you need her
She's there if you dare to give your broken wings a try
C'mon and take a leap and fly, and you can be her

(She's gonna be ridin' through) Oh, Juanita
(She's gonna be ridin' free) Ridin' free
(She's gonna be a part of you, gonna be a part of me)
She's a part of you and a part of me, yeah

Oh, go with her-- flow with her
Dream with her-- scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
If you can find her and free her
Juanita will unchain your heart

Oh, go with her--flow with her
Dream with her--scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be

Oh, go with her-- flow with her
Dream with her-- scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
If you can find her and free her
Juanita will unchain your heart
