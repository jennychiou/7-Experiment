Hoo!
This is what a woman wants

Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, still better love me
And I can be late for a date, that's fine
But he'd better be on time

Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah
I like it that way

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, "Mmm, I like it like that", yeah

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah
I like it that way

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine, hoo!

Let me hear you say "Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah
I like it that way"

(Any man) (Any man)
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine, hoo!

Then you gotta shimmy, and shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, do-si-do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody, on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup, two, hup, woo!
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
Hoo!
This is what a woman wants
