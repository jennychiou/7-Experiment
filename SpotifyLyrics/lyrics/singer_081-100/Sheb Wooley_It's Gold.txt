It's gold it's gold it's gold came the cry from Sacramento
It's gold it's gold it's gold

John Marshall came a ridin' his findins to report
Showed the gold to Colonel Sudder there at Sudder's fort
It's rich by Joe said the Colonel and the news spread all around
And it started thousands sayin' I'm California bound

It's gold it's gold it's gold came the cry from Sacramento
It's gold it's gold it's gold

Yeah the hills were full of miners they seemed to come in droves
And everyone was looking for that solid vein of gold
They were very few who found it and the others changed their plans
Those farmers would be miners became farmers once again

It's gold it's gold it's gold came the cry from Sacramento
It's gold it's gold it's gold

And the sweethearts left behind them soon were on their way
Out to California where they put down roots to stay
In the California valleys that rich and fertile land
Well they found the gold more lasting than the gold they came to pan

It's gold it's gold it's gold came the cry from Sacramento
It's gold it's gold it's gold
