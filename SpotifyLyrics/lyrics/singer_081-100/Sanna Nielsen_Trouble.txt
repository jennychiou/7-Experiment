I remember when I met your eyes
It was love out of the perfect kind
You took me high up in your sky to fly
But I crashed into a sea of lies

You gave me all you had to give
But I just closed the door
You don't know what you have until
You don't have it no more

I'm in real, real trouble, trouble
Dee-dee-deep deep trouble, trouble
I know I did wrong, I screwed it all up
Never wanted it to hurt so bad
I'm in real, real trouble, trouble
Dee-dee-deep deep trouble, trouble
I've made a mistake and now that you've gone
I'm losing my head, yeah

The light we had was shining bright
And now we see, it's slowly dying out
I crashed and burnt a million times
But it's all too late to apologize
Too late to make it right

You gave me all you had to give
But I just closed the door
You don't know what you have until
You don't have it no more

I'm in real, real trouble, trouble
Dee-dee-deep deep trouble, trouble
I know I did wrong, I screwed it all up
Never wanted it to hurt so bad
I'm in real, real trouble, trouble
Dee-dee-deep deep trouble, trouble
I've made a mistake and now that you've gone
I'm losing my head, yeah

Whoa...

Did I get in so deep just to throw it away
I'd do anything, anything to make you stay
I don't know who I was but I'm really sure now
I'd do anything, anything

'Cause I'm in real
I'm in real, real trouble, trouble
Dee-dee-deep deep trouble, trouble
I know I did wrong, I screwed it all up
Never wanted it to hurt so bad
I'm in real, real trouble, trouble
Dee-dee-deep deep trouble, trouble
I've made a mistake and now that you've gone
I'm losing my head, yeah
