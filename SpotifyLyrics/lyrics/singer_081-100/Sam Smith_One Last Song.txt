Maybe one day I won't sing about you
I'll sing a song about someone new
But right here, right now, you are on my mind
And I think about you all the time

I'm sending a message to you
And I'm hoping that it will get through

When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listening, so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

And I hope it makes you feel
And I hope it makes you burn
And I hope it reminds you of how much it hurt

I'm sending a message to you
And I'm hoping that it will get through

When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listening, so here's one last song for you

In case you hear this, then know you're the love of my life
Want to tell you I'm sorry, I miss having you by my side
When you were mine

When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me
So this is what I will do
Maybe you're listening, so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you
