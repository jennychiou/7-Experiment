This could be it, I think I'm in love
It's love this time
It just seems to fit, I think I'm in love
This love is mine

I can see you with me when I'm older
All my lonely night are finally over
You took the weight of the world off my
Shoulders (the world just goes away)

Oh, when you kiss me
I know you miss me--
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hug me
The way you show me that you
Adore me--oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah

You are the one, I think I'm in love
Life has begun

I can see the two of us together
I know I'm gonna be with you forever
Love couldn't be any better

Oh, when you kiss me
I know you miss me--
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hug me
The way you show me that you
Adore me--oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah

I can see you with me when I'm older
All my lonely nights are finally over
You took the weight of the world off my
Shoulders (the world just goes away)

Oh, when you kiss me
I know you miss me--
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hug me
The way you show me that you
Adore me--oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah

And when you kiss me
I know you miss me
Oh, the world just goes away
When you kiss me
