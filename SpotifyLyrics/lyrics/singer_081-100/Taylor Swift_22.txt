It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew.")
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh, yeah, hey!

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
(I don't know about you)
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
(You don't know about me)
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
(Dance like we're)
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (oh-woah-oh)
Twenty-two (dancing like)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
