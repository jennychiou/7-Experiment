They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy

We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down

All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love, love
When shadows and demons are chasing
There's no way that our hearts will be breaking
'Cause all we have is love, love

We don't need a dream to be wide awake
When every day is ecstasy
We won't let the stars crossed change our fate
It's heaven when you're next to me

We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down

All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love, love
When shadows and demons are chasing
There's no way that our hearts will be breaking
'Cause all we have is love, love

They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy

All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love, love
When shadows and demons are chasing
There's no way that our hearts will be breaking
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love, love
