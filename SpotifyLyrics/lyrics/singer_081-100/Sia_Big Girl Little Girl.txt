Big girl little girl you're a rip curl
Tearing your way through this big world
I know you're mad, you're on a warpath
But you know you don't want to bury more friends
And we could be friends
I wish that we were friends
But you can't stop seeing us as the enemy

Big girl it's hell being unwell
You know you're stuck, where you fell
Your words give birth like rosemary
You know you don't want to bury more friends
And we could be friends
I wish that we were friends
But you can't stop seeing us as the enemy.

You know with every cruel word that you utter
That you bury yourself
Even deeper every day
Oh little girl, there's enough love in this circle,
You can shackle yourself or be free from this pain
