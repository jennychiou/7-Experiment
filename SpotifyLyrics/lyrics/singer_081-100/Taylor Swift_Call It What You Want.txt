My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gun fight
They took the crown but it's alright

All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm

All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him

And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right

I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial
On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
(Which is more than they can say)

I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly I said,
"You don't need to save me,
But would you run away with me?"
Yes

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to)
(So, call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want)
(Call it what you want to)
(Call it what you want to)
Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want
To
