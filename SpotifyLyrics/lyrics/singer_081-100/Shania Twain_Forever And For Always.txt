Mmmmm, In your arms
Oh
I can feel your heartbeat now
I can hear you feel it now

In your arms,
I can still feel the way you want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered when you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms

And there ain't no way
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
Always

Baby

In your heart
I can still hear a beat for every time you kiss me
And when we're apart, I know how much you miss me
I can feel your love for me in your heart

And there ain't no way (And there ain't no way)
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way (And there ain't no way)
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face, always

Wanna wake up every morning
Yeah

And in your eyes (I can still see the look of the one)
I can still see the look of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything else in the world above me
(I can still see your love for me)
I can still see your love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)

And there ain't no way, hey yay (And there ain't no way)
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way (And there ain't no way)
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your face

I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
I'm keeping you forever and for always

I'm keeping you forever
Into keeping day
Ah
That's okay for me
You know I will forever
I'm in your arms
