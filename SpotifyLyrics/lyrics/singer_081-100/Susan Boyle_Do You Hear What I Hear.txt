Said the night wind
To the little lamb
Do you see what I see?
Way up in de sky little lamb
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
Whit a tail as big as a kite

Said yhe little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky
Shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy
To the mighty king
Do you know what I know?
In you palace wall might y king
Do you know what I know?
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him
Silver and gold
Let us bring him
Silver and gold
Let us brinh him
Silver and gold
Do you know what I know
So you see what I see?
Do you hear what I hear?
