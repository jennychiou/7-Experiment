Clipped wings, I was a broken thing
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing
You'd worn me down
I struggled on the ground

So lost, the line had been crossed
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk
You held me down
I struggle to fly now

But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny
It eats us alive, oh it eats us alive

Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't want to die, no
I don't want to die, I don't want to die, yeah

And I don't care if I sing off-key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free

No, I don't care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

Now I fly, hit the high notes, I
Have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight
You held me down, but I fought back loud

There's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
It eats us alive, oh it eats us alive

Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't want to die, no
I don't want to die, I don't want to die

And I don't care if I sing off-key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free

No, I don't care if I sing off-key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
