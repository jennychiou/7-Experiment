Put on my best dress, I wanted to impress
I put a little make-up on
Put a bow in my hair, wore pretty underwear
Hoping you might take it off

Don't know your etiquette but I'm strapped to my chair
And it ain't 'cause you're pretty
You were charming until you saw your chance to kill
Your chance to make history

You went straight for the knife and I prepared to die
Your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye, you turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight

You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess
Boy, you and your promises
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss
Now you'll just have memories

You went straight for the knife and I prepared to die
Your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye, you turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight

You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

Boy, you draw me back in
I'm hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word?

You went straight for the knife and I prepared to die
Your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye, you turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight

You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
You wonder why you make girls cry
