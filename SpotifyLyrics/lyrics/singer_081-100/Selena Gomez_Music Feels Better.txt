All I need is love
That's what you give, I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
That's what I feel when your skin's on mine

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

All I need is true
That's what you are
When everything's alright
All I need is here
Right where you are, you're every reason why

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire
Cause you set me up on fire
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better
