Tin horn gamblers crooked games
And dance hall girls to entertain
The miners and their fortunes share

There in the bar at the Last Chance Saloon
Rosie would dance to a rinky dink tune
As the girls in the line did their tah rah boom dee ay
The miners would clink their glasses and say

Yeah Rosie's the Queen of Californy Rosie's the love of my life
When I hit that solid vein that I know is on my claim
Rosie said she'd be my wife

All day on my claim I've been breakin' muh back
Washin' the sand tryin' to fill up muh sack
But it's worth all the gold that I dug out today
To see her put in the tah rah boom dee ay

Yeah Rosie's the Queen of Californy...

Ah the way to go Rosie ha ha ha ha ha come on kid
Set 'em up again over here ha ha ha go Rosie

Rosie's the Queen of Californy Rosie's the love of my life
When I hit that solid vein that I know is on my claim
Rosie said she'd be my promise that she'd be
Rosie said she'd be my wife
