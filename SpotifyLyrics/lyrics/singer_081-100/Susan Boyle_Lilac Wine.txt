I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Lost my heart in its recipe
Made me see what I want to see
Be what I want to be

But I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine
Is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine
I feel unsteady, like my love

Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that he coming to me, nearly here

Lilac wine
Is sweet and heady, where's my love
Lilac wine
I feel unsteady, lwhere's my love

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy
Isn't that he, or am I going crazy, dear

Lilac wine
I feel I'm ready for my love
Feel I'm ready
For my love
