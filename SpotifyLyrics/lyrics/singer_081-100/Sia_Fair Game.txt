You terrify me 'cause you're a man, you're not a boy
You got some power and I can't treat you like a toy
You're the road less traveled by a little girl
You disregard the mess while I try to control the world

Don't leave me, stay here and frighten me
Don't leave me, come now, enlighten me
Give me all you got, give me your wallet and your watch
Give me your firstborn, give me the rainbow and the

So go and challenge me, take the reins and see
Watch me squirm baby, but you are just what I need

And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand

If I can't respect any man?
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game

You terrify me, we've still not kissed and yet I've cried
You got too close and I pushed and pushed hoping you'd bite
So I could run, run and that I did but through the dust
You saw those teeth marks, they weren't all yours, you had been thrust

Into a history that had not worked for me
Into a history from which I could not flee
So go on shake me, shake until I give it up
Wearing me down baby, I know that we could make some love

So go and challenge me, take the reins and see
Watch me squirm baby, but you are just what I need

And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand

If I can't respect any man?
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game

I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man?
And I want to play a fair game

Though I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man?
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
