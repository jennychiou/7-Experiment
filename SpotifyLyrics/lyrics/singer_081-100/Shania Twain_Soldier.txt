Don't close the door when you leave, it's cold out
I need to see the air when you breathe, and say out loud
That you'll be home soon, not to worry you're gonna hurry back

Has anybody seen my soldier, standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier, just trying to get home

You're not alone when you dream, I'm with you
I hear your heart when it beats, I feel it too
Sleep in peace, love is tender, please remember me

Has anybody seen my soldier, standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier, just trying to get home

Where did you go, my love
I need to know, you're safe
So many miles, between us
I need to see your face

Has anybody seen my soldier, standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier

Has anybody seen my soldier, standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier, just trying to get home
He's trying to get home
