My mother's afraid of the subway
It's a living bad dream
I hold her hand as the doors close
And she pales and stifles a scream

Ali's afraid of ad-libbing
Of improvising at jams
She is not very happy right now
And spends all her money on grams

Ade is afraid of commitment
So Carla dumped him today
She is very disappointed
She was hoping he'd beg her to stay

Ayo, he just wants a girlfriend
He's afraid of dying alone
He doesn't go out very much
Sits at home a lot getting stoned

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

Ella is worried about her weight
She won't eat in public anymore
She is fucking her ex again
When they've finished, she sleeps on the floor

Nate has a heart of gold
But give it away he will not
His mother abandoned him at ten
It's a pain he has never forgot

Mary's afraid of herself
Her sentences often cut half
She will never give her own opinion
She's afraid that people might laugh

And I am afraid of sharks
I will not swim out past my head
And sometimes I worry my boyfriend will die
My first love is already dead

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

Candy is having a baby
She fears she will be like her mom
Her friends say, "Relax, take a deep breath
And march to a different drum"

Sachas afraid of her Marco
She think's that it's all her fault
But if he did what he does to a stranger
He'd be locked up and charged with assault

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear
