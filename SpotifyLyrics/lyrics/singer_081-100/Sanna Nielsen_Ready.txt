I wasn't ready 'cause I was convinced
I wasn't gonna risk being broken again
Safely folded up here inside my life, yeah

Never say never, your eyes said to me
And suddenly I found me, miraculously
Built my courage up, now it's time to try

Walking the wire, I won't look down
And maybe I'll fall but I'm flying now
All the colors, colors, colors of emotion
Lift me till I'm floating on love
I'm really ready

I'm getting closer, one step at a time
I've slowly uncovered my heart's fear of heights
Straight into your arms on the other side, say

Walking the wire, I won't look down
And maybe I'll fall but I'm flying now
All the colors, colors, colors of emotion
Lift me till I'm floating on love
I'm really ready

Ah...

If I'm sleeping I could, at least I can feel good
That I stood at the top of the world
And I see what it's like, for I'm standing close to the sky

Walking the wire, I won't look down
And maybe I'll fall but I'm flying now
All the colors, colors, colors of emotion
Lift me till I'm floating on love

Walking the wire, I won't look down
And maybe I'll fall but I'm flying now
All the colors, colors, colors of emotion
Lift me till I'm floating on love
I'm really ready

I wasn't ready but now I'm convinced
