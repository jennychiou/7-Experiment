Just when I thought I was old enough to realize
This girl came along and said
"Boy you've been livin' a lie"
She said "Your heart's misplaced
I can see it in your face
You know how to run but you're losin' the race
And in the end, no one can change that but you"

What do you do?
With this kind of talk goin' 'round
When you know that she's right
It's pointless to fight
With a girl who has got your heart down

So I decided to hear what she had in mind
And soon I realized she was giving me more than her time
She said "It's all on your side
And you'd better take advantage
Get out of line
I'm sure that you could manage
Then just take your time
And don't let them take advantage of you"

What do you do?
With this kind of talk goin' 'round
When you know that she's right
It's pointless to fight
With a girl who has got your heart down

She caught me comin' and goin'
She never knew what she gave to me
From the start I never knew what to be
