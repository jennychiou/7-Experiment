I didn't know
What I would find
When I went lookin' for a reason
I know
I didn't read
Between the lines
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever
Try to be better?
Nobody ever
Let's me in
And I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there
But never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this
A part of yo
And now it's all too late
So you see
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever
Try to be better?
Nobody ever
Let's me in
And I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah
How can I ever
Try to be better?
Nobody ever
Let's me in
And I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
