Pick me up in your arms
Carry me away from harm
You're never gonna put me down, oh
I know you're just one good man
You'll tire before we see land
You're never gonna put me down

Oh, I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah, I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not day too soon

Honey, I will stitch you
Darling, I will fit you in my heart
Honey, I will meet you
Darling, I will keep you in my heart

You'll risk all this for just a kiss
I promise I will not resist
Promise you won't hold me down, oh
And when we reach a good place
Let's be sure to leave no trace
Promise they won't track us down

Now, I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah, I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon

Honey, I will stitch you
Darling, I will feel you in my heart
Honey, I will meet you
Darling, I will keep you in my heart

I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon

Oh honey, I will stitch you
Darling, I will feel you in my heart
Honey, I will meet you
Darling, I will keep you in my heart

Honey, I will stitch you
Darling, I will feel you in my heart
Honey, I will meet you
Darling, I will keep you in my heart

Honey, I will stitch you
Darling, I will feel you in my heart
Honey, I will meet you
