We are anything but unremarkable
We found things that we had given up on.
We were two peas in a pod, oh yeah

Peas indeed, seven good deeds
You're a man of strength, a man indeed
We found things that we had given up on.

Now that you have gone I know it won't be long
You will be waiting for me, faithfully, baby...

Now I'm taking your love from above
You're here and you're never gonna leave me
I will carry you on well so long
Your love is never gonna leave me

Now I'm taking your love from above
You're here and you're never gonna leave me
I will carry you on well so long
Your love is never gonna leave me

Well you touched my heart and then gave me yours
I was so afraid, I tried to ignore all the butterflies
Taking me over

We are anything but unremarkable
We found things that we had given up on
We found love, oh yeah...

Now that you have gone I know it won't be long
You will be waiting for me, faithfully, baby...

Now I'm taking your love from above
You're here and you're never gonna leave me
I will carry you on well so long
Your love is never gonna leave me

You're never gonna leave me
You're never gonna love me

Now that you have gone I know it won't be long
You will be waiting for me, faithfully, baby...

Now I'm taking your love from above
You're here and you're never gonna leave me
I will carry you on well so long
Your love is never gonna leave me

Now I'm taking your love from above
You're here and you're never gonna leave me
I will carry you on well so long
Your love is never gonna leave me
