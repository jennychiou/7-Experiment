Stealing hearts was your pastime
I saw girls falling hook line
You stole kisses and threw them aside
Hits and misses, you lost sight

You've changed
For the better
You've changed
For the better

Making waves was your hobby
Then I asked you to hold me
And I knew it, you do it all over the world
But all is different now I'm your girl

But you've changed
For the better
You've changed
For the better

You've changed
For the better
You've changed
For the better

You've changed
For the better
You've changed
For the better

You've changed
For the better
You've changed
For the better
