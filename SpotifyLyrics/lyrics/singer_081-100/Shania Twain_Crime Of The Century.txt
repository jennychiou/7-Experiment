I was into bein' out on my own
I could take love or leave it alone
That's how you get when you're hurt to the bone
One too many times
I had this heart of mine locked away
I kept my guard up night an' day
I had enough of the games they play
Out there on the line...

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood an' rescued me
Ali Baba an' the Forty Thieves
Ain't got nothin' on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbin' trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

You stacked the deck, you didn't gamble at all
You knew exactly how the cards would fall
You bet your heart, but as I recall
I didn't even stand a chance
I bet you had an ace up your sleeve
An' here I thought that you were so naive
You took my hand an' made me believe
In love an' real romance...

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood an' rescued me
Ali Baba an' the Forty Thieves
Ain't got nothin' on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbin' trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

An' if I live to be a hundred an' one
Honey, don'cha think that it would be fun
To do it all over again...

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood an' rescued me 
Ali Baba an' the Forty Thieves
Ain't got nothin' on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbin' trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

I'm gonna lock you up and throw away the key
It was the crime of the century
It was love in the third degree
It was the crime of the century
