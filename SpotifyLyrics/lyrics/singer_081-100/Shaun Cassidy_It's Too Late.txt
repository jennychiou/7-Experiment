Now you found out that your new love
Isn't true like he should be
You say you're gonna forget him
And you're gonna come back to me

Well, things have changed
And I found somebody new
Someone to make me forget about you
And I'm telling you

That it's too late to say you're sorry
It's too late to say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm gonna make her mine
It's too late, it's too late to say you're mine

Many days I tried to call ya
Many nights I spent alone
And everyone knew that I loved you
But you had a love of your own

Now that it's gone
You think you can come back to me
Well, I'm not the same guy that I used to be
And you're gonna see

That it's too late to say you're sorry
It's too late to say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm gonna make her mine
It's too late, it's too late to say you're mine

That it's too late to say you're sorry
It's too late to say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm gonna make her mine
It's too late, it's too late to say you're mine
