He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour that I don't understand 'cause
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Maybe he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
And stop deceiving Lord please

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
