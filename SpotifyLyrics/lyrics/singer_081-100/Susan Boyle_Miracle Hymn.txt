On a starry night in bethlehem
A child was born to bring light to men
Aand off with wind our eyes grew dim
In a candle's light, we found hope again

There are miracles all around
Miracles yet to be found
Hid in every heart is an awesome prayer
Like a candle's flame, hope will lead us there

And the darkness comes, let the light shine through
A spark of flame will ignite in you
In a candle's glow, a virgin's womb
In a simple prayer in the empty tomb

There are miracles all around
Miracles yet to be found
Hid in every heart is an awesome prayer
Like a candle's flame, hope will lead us there

When the light has dawned on christmas day
We will raise our voice in endless praise
When the light has dawned on christmas day
We will say

There are miracles all around
Miracles yet to be found
Hid in every heart is an awesome prayer
Like a candle's flame, hope will lead us there
