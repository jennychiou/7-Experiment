Don't cry snowman, not in front of me
Who will catch your tears if you can't catch me darling
If you can't catch me darling
Don't cry snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close babay
Can't hold me close baby

I want you to know that I'm never leavin'
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, till death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go

Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever, oh we'll have some fun
Yes let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now it's Christmas baby

My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby

Don't cry snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run honey
Without legs to run honey
Don't cry snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears baby
If you don't have ears baby

I want you to know that I'm never leavin'
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, till death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go

Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever, oh we'll have some fun
Yes let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now it's Christmas baby

My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby
