I went up to the mountain because you asked me to
Up over the clouds to where the sky was blue
I could see all around me everywhere
I could see all around me everywhere

Sometimes I feel like I've never been nothing but tired
And I'll be walking till the day I expire
So sometimes I just lay me down, no more can I do
But then I go on again because you ask me to

Some days I look down afraid, afraid I will fall
And though the sun shines I see nothing, nothing at all
Then I hear your, your sweet voice, ooh
Come and then go, come and then go
Lord, telling me softly you love me so
