Today to you I'm invisible
Tomorrow you may still be out of reach
But someday you and I will be possible
We'll be alone making love on the beach

By then we won't remember what it was like
Before you and I fell in love
That we were ever not together in this life
Hard to imagine the way it was

You are the light of my life
My little piece of the pie
American beauty, apple of my eye
You are the light of my life

I've heard people say that if they could
Do it all over again they never would
It's better to have loved someone and lost
Then, to have never loved at all

I am not afraid to give my heart
Even though you don't know I exist
Cause in my sleep you hold me close in the dark
A million times I've tasted your lips

You are the light of my life
My little piece of the pie
American beauty, apple of my eye
You are the light of my life

I'm saving myself for you
There is no wait long enough
Ain't no way I'm giving up
Maybe I'm a fool
But nothing makes me feel so right
Than dreaming about you at night

You are the light of my life
My little piece of the pie
American beauty, apple of my eye
You are the light of my life

You are the light of my life
My little piece of the pie
American beauty, apple of my eye
You are the light of my life
