O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant, 
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him, 
Born the King of Angels; 
O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
Christ the Lord.

O Sing, choirs of angels, 
Sing in exultation, 
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word.
Give to our Father glory in the Highest; 
O come, let us adore Him, 

O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
Christ the Lord.

All Hail! Lord, we greet Thee, 
Born this happy morning, 
O Jesus! for evermore be Thy name adored.
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing; 
O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
Christ the Lord.
