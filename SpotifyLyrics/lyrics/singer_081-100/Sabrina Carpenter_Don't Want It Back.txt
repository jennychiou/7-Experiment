You are the voice inside my mind
Something so real is hard to find
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I'll hold you tight, remove the air
No space between, I want you here
I know, I know (I know, I know)
Baby, you're home

Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're livin' for tonight...

You give me a reason to feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
You got my heart, I don't want it back

This moment can't be washed away
A part of you's a part of me
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
This love we have will never end
We're circles, we begin again
I know, I know
Baby, I'm home

Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time, no
We're livin' for tonight

You give me a reason (ooh, no) to feel what I feel (no, no)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears (no, no)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
You got my heart, I don't want it back

You give me a reason (huh)
You give me a feeling (uh-huh-a)
But all of the things you've given to me
You've given to me, baby...

You give me a reason to (no, no) feel what I feel
When everything is under attack (oh, no)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer (oh no, no) to all of my fears (oh)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
Don't want it back, no, baby
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
