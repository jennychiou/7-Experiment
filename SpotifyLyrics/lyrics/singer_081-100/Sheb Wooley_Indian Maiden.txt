Now way up in the Oklahoma hills
Mid the white oak trees and the daffodils
Lived the prettiest Indian maid I ever saw
She was the great grand daughter of Geronimo
And her maw was the tribe of the Navajo
I thought I'd like to have her for my squaw

I got to know this Indian miss
And then se about to steal me a kiss
She was just as sweet as the mornin' dew
We got out under that Indian moon
And then we really started to spoon
'Cause she was a romancin' little Sioux

Mmmm I love my Indian ma ay ed
Oh I wish I could have stayed
I said uh honey I love you
She said Pete I love you too
I'll never forget my little Indian maid

Then along came a chief and seventeen braves
And they started out a diggin' a grave
And I said who's that for and the chief said you
Well they kept on diggin' and diggin' away
And I turned to the chief and again I say
Is that sure enough for me and the chief said ugh

I said now Chief I'll marry your daughter
But first I gotta have a drink of water
I think I'll run down to the river and get me a drink
I told White Dove to kiss me quick
And I started out runnin' through them sticks
And I tore my pants and my rawhide underwear

I kept on runnin' I was afraid to walk
Cause here come the chief with his tommyhawk
And I was sailin' over them cactus just like a bird
My boots wore out and I'm all scratched up
And no cowboy should have such luck
Excuse me folks I better get back to the herd

I love my Indian ma ay ed
Mmmm I wish I could have stayed
I wanta go back to see but the chief's still after me
I'll never forget my little Indian maid
