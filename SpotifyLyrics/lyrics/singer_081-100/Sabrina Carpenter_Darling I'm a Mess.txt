This might be wrong, but he's all I know
He's all I know
Most times I pretend that he's just a friend
He's just a friend

Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine

But darling I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying
I'm trying to get by
But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss

Your lips I'll miss, 'cause they're all I know
I can't let you go
And I won't forget, all that you said
It's engraved in my head

Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine

But darling I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying
I'm trying to get by
But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss

No oh, a goodbye kiss
Yeah I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine

But darling I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying
I'm trying to get by
But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
