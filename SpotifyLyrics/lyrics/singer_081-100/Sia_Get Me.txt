Now I don't mind if you find that I'm a shoulder to cry on rely on
But the burden is just too much I'm losing touch with myself and my health

What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me

Now I don't keep you from your sleep I need some ease I'm tired of trying to please
And it seems that my dreams are coming farther and fewer in between

What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
