(Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rawhide rawhide rawhide)

Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' thought the streams are swollen
Keep them dogies rollin' rawhide
Through rain and wind and weather hell bent for leather
Wishin' my gal was by my side
All the things I'm missin' good fiddles love and kissin'
Are waitin' at the end of my ride

Move 'em on head 'em up head 'em up move 'em on
Move 'em on head 'em up rawhide
Head 'em out ride 'em in ride 'em in let 'em out
Cut 'em out ride 'em in rawhide

(Movin' movin' movin' movin' movin' movin' movin' movin')

Movin' movin' movin' movin' thought they're disapprovin'
Keep them dogies movin' rawhide
Don't try to understand them rope and throw and brand them
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide
My heart's calculatin' my true love will be waitin'
Be waitin' at the end of my ride

Move 'em on head 'em up head 'em up move 'em on...

(Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rawhide)
