Is it woman's intuition some how you seem to know that I'll be goin'
For my lips just felt the dampness of a teardrop that you're trying hard to hide
Like a wild thing comes a season honey I don't know the reason
But I can't resist that lonesome whistle sound
Now the urge is strong for goin' in the morning you'll be knowin'
And there ain't no way to tie a tiger down 

Were you wrapped up in our love so strong you didn't even know when I grew restless
Or was it the wisdom of a woman that makes you know it's better left alone
When you see me at my packin' don't think that you were lackin'
For your tender love's the sweetest that I've found
But this urge is strong for goin' in the morning you'll be knowin'
That there ain't no way to tie a tiger down 

I don't understand my body or the drives that make me know it's time for goin'
Though there's something deep inside me that tells me I will reep the seeds I sow
I know you'll see no wrong in takin' care of my belongins
Till I write you from some little Okie town
I can feel my body shakin' for the heart I know I'm breakin'
But there ain't no way to tie a tiger down
