Morning girl, where you been so long?
Your lips have got some color now
A little too much color now
Your clothes have gone from nylon to lace somehow

Morning girl, my, you've been around
I see you haven't found your man
The diamonds on the other hand
Well, the man is hard to find in a woman's land

Oh, don't let too many fears wash away your dreams
Just tell yourself that nothing matters
But be prepared 'cause someday, girl
You'll forget my name and all I've ever said to you

And all I've ever meant to you
And now your getting up and I've got things to do

Morning girl 'cause someday, girl
You'll forget my name and all I've ever said to you
And all I've ever meant to you
And now your getting up and I've got things to do

Morning girl, where you been so long?
And now your getting up and I've got things to do
Morning girl, where you been so long?
And now your getting up and I've got things to do

Morning girl
