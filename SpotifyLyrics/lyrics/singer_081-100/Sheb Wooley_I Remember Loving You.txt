I look at my ole suitcase and I think of all the places that I've been
All the railyards and the jailguards and the dumpy little towns that I've been in
And the whispers of the people as they see me ever movin' passin' through
Yes I remember all these things but mostly I remember loving you

I remember loving you like no other love I knew
I've forgotten quite a few but I remember loving you

The dingy smells of cheap hotels or huddled in some boxcar from the rain
The flashin' lights that cut the night and the railroad bull that kicked me off the train
The wind that blows the winter snow and freezin' in the cold until I'm blue
Yes I remember all these things but mostly I remember loving you

I remember loving you like no other love I knew
I've forgotten quite a few but I remember loving you
