I'm in the wars 
Can't speak for crying 
Close all the doors 
Since I am dying 
Pick up the phone 
Attempt to call her 
I'm all alone 
Until she answers 

Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me 

She barely speaks 
But I hear her breathing 
That's all I need 
Someone who's listening 
And still she stays 
Her time is precious 
Until I am safe 
She gives her presence 

Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me
