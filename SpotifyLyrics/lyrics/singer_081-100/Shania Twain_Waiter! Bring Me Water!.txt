He took me to--our favorite spot
A place we go to hang a lot
Something seemed to catch his eye
Oh--ooh--oh over my shoulder
Oh--ooh--oh over my shoulder

I turned around--to see what's up
A pretty young thing sure enough
She was new--he wanted to
Know--ooh--oh--oh--ooh--ow her
Know--ooh--oh--oh--ooh--ow her

Oh--yeah--
Then she flicked her hair (yeah!)
Oh--yeah--he began to stare

Waiter! (Waiter) Bring me water!
I gotta make him keep his cool
(Waiter) Bring me water!
He's acting like a fool
(Waiter) Bring me water!

Uh, oh, I did my best--to block his view
But it was like he could see through me
I just knew--he wanted to
Ho--ooh--oh--oh--ooh--oh--old her
Ho--ooh--oh--oh--ooh--oh--old her

Oh--yeah--I ain't gettin' nowhere (yeah!)
Oh--yeah--she's still standing there

Waiter! (Waiter) Bring me water!
I gotta make him keep his cool
(Waiter) Bring me water!
He's acting like a fool
(Waiter) Bring me water!

There's gotta be a way to cool this clown--
He's starting to embarrass me
I may even have to hose him down--
Bring me water
I don't know what he finds so distracting--
What's so hot about her
I really don't like the way he's acting
Bring me water!

Uh, Bring it on!
Uh
Oh
What's so hot about her
Uh, uh, uh,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Waiter, bring me water)
Gotta make him keep his cool
(Waiter, bring me water)
Send him back to school
(Waiter, bring me water)
He's acting like a fool
(Waiter, bring me water)
Waiter, bring me water
