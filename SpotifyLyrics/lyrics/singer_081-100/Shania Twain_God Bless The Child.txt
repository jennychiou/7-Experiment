Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the young without mothers

This child is homeless
That child's on crack
One plays with her gun
While the other takes the bullet in his back

This boy's a beggar
That girl sells her soul
They both work the same street
The same hell hole

Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let every man help his brother

Some were born evicted
And some were just thrown away
And some have daddies
Who make them play games
They don't want to play

But there's hope and faith
And we must understand
That all God's children need His love
And to hold the little hands

This boy is hungry, he ain't got enough to eat
That girl's cold and she ain't got no shoes on her feet
When a child's spirit's broken
It feels all hope is gone
God, help them find the strength to carry on

Because with a little hope and faith
If we can understand that
All God's children need is love
And to hold the little hands

Just a little hope
With a little love
A little love to understand that

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let us all love one another

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Make all our hearts blind to color
Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
