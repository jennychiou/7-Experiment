It's all about love
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's all about love
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

We were hostages of war in the middle of a fight that seemed to never end
I remember being four, crying silently my sister in my arms
And I didn't understand why you hated us so much and yet would still pretend
That you loved us both so much that everyday we'd be your poor

Just break it up, if there's no such thing as love, God is crying up above for us little ones
Just break it up, if there's no real family and there's really no 'we'

It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love

Saw my sister yesterday but we're strangers to each other in a world of pain
And there's nothing left to say and we both know where we really wanna put the blame
'Cause they broke our tiny souls and I do think that we never really had a clue
When I asked my mother once, she said we did it all for you

Just break it up, if there's no such thing as love, God is crying up above for us little ones
Just break it up, if there's no real family and there's really no 'we'

It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love

I walk alone
How could I love someone
When all I know
All the clouds never seen the sun

Just break it up, if there's no such thing as love, God is crying up above for us little ones
Just break it up, if there's no real family and there's really no 'we'

It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love
It's all about love
