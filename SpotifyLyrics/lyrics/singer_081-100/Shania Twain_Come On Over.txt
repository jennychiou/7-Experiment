Get a life - get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break - take control
Take advice from someone you know

Come on over - come on in
Pull up a seat - take a load off your feet
Come on over - come on in
You can unwind - take a load off your mind

Make a wish - make a move
Make up your mind - you can choose
When you're up - when you're down
When you need a laugh come around

Come on over - come on in
Pull up a seat - take a load off your feet
Come on over - come on in
You can unwind - take a load off your mind

Oh, oh, oh...

Be a winner - be a star
Be happy to be who you are
Gotta be yourself - gotta make a plan
Gotta go for it while you can

Come on over - come on in
Pull up a seat - take a load off your feet
Come on over - come on in
You can unwind - take a load off your mind

Get a life - get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break - take control
Take advice from someone you know

Come on over - come on in
Pull up a seat - take a load off your feet
Come on over - come on in
You can unwind - take a load off your mind

Oh, oh, oh...
