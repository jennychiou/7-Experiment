Born to be a roughneck I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe is hard labor

Well I was born in a bloomer shack 'bout a half mile from town
Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew and my mama never was around
Well I learned how to cuss when I was two and to fight when I was three
By the time I was five there was no kid alive
Who could get the best of me

Born to be a roughneck I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe is hard labor

Well I started workin' like a regular man when I was just about knee high
Skinnin' the knuckles with my two bare hands but they never heard me cry
I remember walkin' down the street and I'd hear somebody say
He was born to live a rougneck's life and he's never gonna change his ways

Born to be a roughneck
