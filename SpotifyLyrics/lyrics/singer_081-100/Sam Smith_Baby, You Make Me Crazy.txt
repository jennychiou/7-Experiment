You say that you're leaving, but I don't think I can let go
When you put the phone down, I began to cry
What are you to do, when the person that you love just says no?
Boy, get yourself together, move on with your life

So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
When I gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

It wasn't enough, but you could've had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much, if you'd looked me in the eye
Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their eyes

So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
