Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
