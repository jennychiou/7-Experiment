Your eyes, crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough

All these days I never thought
That I would need someone so much, who knew
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

But I guess that we did it on purpose
But I guess that we did it on purpose

My dreams runnin' into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changin' all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart

All these days I never thought
That I would need someone so much, who knew
Who knew
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

On purpose
But I guess that we did it on purpose
But I guess that we did it on purpose

Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose

Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
Oh, you're scared

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose

Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
