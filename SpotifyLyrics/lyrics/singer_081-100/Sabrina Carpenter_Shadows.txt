We all got nightmares
In our dreams
We look for someone
To believe in us and show us the way
And make it okay
The world can be dangerous

There's something so rare
In your veins
Not a single thing
I would change and oh
If you only knew how I see you
Would you come alive again (alive again)

I, I need you to understand
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine

And listen to me, It's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby I don't

Pictures in our head
Of what we're supposed to be
Measuring ourselves but where is the love
Where is the love
The world got us wondering, wondering

I, I need you to understand
That I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine

And listen to me, It's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby I don't

And all these voices in our head
Well they keep screaming louder and louder
But they won't pull us under

Baby, I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine

And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby I don't
