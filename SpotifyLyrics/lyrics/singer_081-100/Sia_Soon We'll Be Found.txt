Come along
It is the break of day
Surely now
You'll have some things to say
It's not the time
For telling tales on me

So come along
It won't be long till we return happy
Shut your eyes
There are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep?
Tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here
To say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll
Be found

Well it's been rough but we'll be just fine
We'll work it out, yeah we'll survive
We mustn't let a few bad times dictate

So come along
It won't be long till we return happy
Shut your eyes
There are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt
Tomorrow we'll be free

Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep?
Tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here
To say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll
Be found

I know we're lost but soon we'll
Be found

Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep?
Tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here
To say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll
Be found, oh

Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep?
Tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here
To say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll
Be found

"Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep?
Tonight
Don't turn away it's just there's nothing left here
To say
Turn around I know we're lost but soon we'll"
Be found
