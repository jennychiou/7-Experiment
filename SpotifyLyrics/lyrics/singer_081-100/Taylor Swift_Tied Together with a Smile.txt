Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
But, that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Goodbye, baby,
With a smile
Baby, baby, oh
