My tears are fallin' 'cause you're takin' her away
And though it really hurts me so-o
There's somethin' that I gotta say-ay

Take good care-are of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue-ue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinkin' of her
In everything you say and do-ooh

So, take good care-are of my ba-a-aby
Now don't you ever make her cry-why
Just let your love surround her-er
Paint a rainbow all around her-er
Don't let her see a cloudy sky-why

Once upon a time that little girl was mi-ine
And if I had been true, I know she'd never be with you

So-o, take good care-are of my ba-a-aby
Be just as ki-ind as you can be-ee
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my ba-aby back home to me

Take good care-are of my ba-a-aby
Be just as ki-ind as you can be-ee
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my ba-aby back home to me

(Take good care-are of my ba-a-aby)
Send her back to me
(Take good care-are of my ba-a-aby)
'Cause I love her and I miss my baby
(Take good care-are of my ba-a-aby)
(Take good care-are of my ba-a-aby)
