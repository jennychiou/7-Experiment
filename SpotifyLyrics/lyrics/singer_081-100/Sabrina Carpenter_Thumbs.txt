Somewhere in the world there is a father and a mother
And the father is a son who has a mother
The mother has a daughter who gets married to the brother of a mother
And they all just tryna multiply with one another

'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world

Somewhere in the world they think they're working for themselves
They get up every day to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them and so they think they've got it made
But they're all just working to get paid the very same

And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum (Skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum

Somewhere in the world you got a robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people so the people rob the bank
And the police came to get him but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just workin' to get paid the very same

'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world

And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum (Skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum (Skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum

Don't believe everything that you hear
Let it go through your left and right ear
Don't just march to the beat of that drum
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs

'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world

And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum (Skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum (Skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Oh, la)
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum
(Skiddly-dee-da-da-da, da-dum-dum-dum-dum)

And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (They keep on, keep on)
Skiddly-dee-da-dum (They keep on, keep on)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum
'Cause that's just the way of the world
