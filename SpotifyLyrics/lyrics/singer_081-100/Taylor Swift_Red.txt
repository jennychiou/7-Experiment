Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head, in burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
