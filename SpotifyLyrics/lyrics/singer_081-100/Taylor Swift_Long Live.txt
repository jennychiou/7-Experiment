I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling?"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

Long, long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

And I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

And long, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered
