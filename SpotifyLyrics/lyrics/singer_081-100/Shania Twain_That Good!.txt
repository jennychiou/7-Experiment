I'll be there when you're sleepin'
And every hour you're awake
I wanna hear your secrets-
Wanna share your worries
Wanna go the deepest-
I don't wanna hurry
I wanna take a lifetime to memorize your face
Wanna hold you closer- kiss you longer
Wanna hear your heartbeat-
Stronger and stronger

Wanna know you all over
Till I know you by heart
Gotta know you with all that I got

I wanna know you that good!
Like no one knows you
Gonna reach way down deep in your mind
I wanna get to know you-
Wanna get to know
Wanna get to know you that good

Gonna know you right through
You know I want to so badly it hurts all the time
I wanna get to know you-
Wanna get to know
Wanna get to know you that good
Yeah, I wanna know you that good

Every feel of your fingers-
Every curl in your hair
Don't wanna miss a minute-
Wanna be right in it
Do everything you're doing
Go everywhere you're goin'

Wanna know you all over
Till I know you by heart
Gotta know you with all that I got

I wanna know you that good!
Like no one knows you
Gonna reach way down deep in your mind
I wanna get to know you-
Wanna get to know
Wanna get to know you that good

I wanna know you that good
Wanna know your emotions-
Wanna taste every tear
Wanna hear you breathin'-
Feel what your feelin'
I wanna get to know
Know you that good!
Like now one knows you
Gonna reach way down deep in your mind
I wanna get to know you-
Wanna get to know
I wanna get to know you-
Wanna get to know
Wanna get to know
To know you
I wanna know you by heart
I wanna know you that good
