So naive, it helps me to breathe
Yor smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
I'm your greatest fan

Little man I'm endlessly proud of you
In such a short time span
You've filled my heart with joy
As I grow older, you grow wiser
Watching my mistakes
Memorise where I've gone wrong

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as do
Trust me and you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

Little man yor head is full of dreams
If only I could spend one day touring
Your imagination
If I live longer you'll grow faster
At recognising the traps that cause
Me such frustration

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me and you'll see
All I want is what is best for you
(x3)

So naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
I'm your greatest fan
