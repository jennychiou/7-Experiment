Days go by
I've been waiting for about a month
Friendly fires from a silent front, I'm going
And I don't cry
Sleeping in the middle of the bed
I'm so ashamed of all the shit I said, I'm going
Heaven's quiet

Love is cruel
And, God, I miss you
And, God, I miss you

What I need won't be underneath a guiding star
Won't be lying by the foot of a rainbow
Foot of a rainbow
What I need is unreliable, a bit bizarre
And kind of crooked like the foot of a rainbow
The foot of a rainbow
Oh, 'cause all I want is you
This love's crazy, but it's you I want

Days go by
I've been standing in the pouring rain
Praying quietly for something to change everything
And I don't cry
It's so inside, I'm like a surging lake
Waters rising and my heart's afraid she can't swim
And heaven's quiet

Love is cruel
And, God, I miss you
And, God, I miss you

What I need won't be underneath a guiding star
Won't be lying by the foot of a rainbow
Foot of a rainbow
What I need is unreliable, a bit bizarre
And kind of crooked like the foot of a rainbow
The foot of a rainbow
Oh, 'cause all I want is you
This love's crazy, but it's you I want

I want rainbows, rainbows
I want rainbows, rainbows
I want rainbows, rainbows

Days go by
I've been waiting for about a month
Friendly fires from a silent front, I'm going

What I need won't be underneath a guiding star
Won't be lying by the foot of a rainbow
Foot of a rainbow
What I need is unreliable, a bit bizarre
And kind of crooked like the foot of a rainbow
The foot of a rainbow
Oh, 'cause all I want is you
This love's crazy, but it's you I want

I want rainbows, rainbows
I want rainbows, rainbows
I want rainbows, rainbows

What I need is unreliable, a bit bizarre
And kinda crooked like the foot of a rainbow
Foot of a rainbow
Rainbows, rainbows
