You don't know me
You can't hold me
I'll slip through your hands
I am one single grain of sand

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need

I'm an empty space
I can't be replaced
So when you're finished with this dream
Delete begin to rewrite me

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
Delete and rewrite me
