Give me sugar when I'm feeling down
Play my favorites on the ride downtown
Love Me Tender, on the radio
Turn it louder, kiss me slow

Roll me on the river
Lay me in the sun
Love me like a giver
Give me some

Listen to me closer when I need your ear
You don't need to say a thing, just be here
Wake me with your wishes, chase me like a star
Follow me until we go too far

Roll me on the river
Lay me in the sun
Love me like a giver
Give me some

Hold me like a promise
Never give me up
Keep me like a secret in your cup

Sober as rain
Feeling no pain, I'm falling
From somewhere high, deep in your eyes I'm all in

Roll me on the river
Lay me in the sun
Love me like a giver
Give me some

Roll me on the river
Lay me in the sun
Love me like a giver
Give me some
Hold me like a promise
Never give me up
Keep me like a secret in your cup
