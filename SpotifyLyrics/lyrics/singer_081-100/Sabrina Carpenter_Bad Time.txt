Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time

You never finish your glass
Take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below
Wouldn't even open your door
You said: "It's a bad time for a good time baby
A bad time"
Too many times I've asked myself
"What did I come here for?"

Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dying to use the line

I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
Where you were calling me and hoping for a good time

Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now
You should know about it, nah nah yeah

Everything's so clear to me now
Wish I could have seen it before
You were sitting comfortable and
I was busy kissing your floor

Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dying to use the line

I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
Where you were calling me and hoping for a good time

Bad time for a good time, baby

You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby

You know that it's a bad time for a good time baby
A bad time
I'm just gonna say it one more time for fun

I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
Where you were calling me and hoping for a good time
