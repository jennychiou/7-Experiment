Healing is difficult
Often results in psychosomatic
I admit to enjoying drugs
They get rid of tension, boredom and static
Hate those adverse side effects
Forcing the people who love me to scatter
Excuse me for being such a hypocrite
The way I see it really doesn't matter

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

To tell you the truth
I can't believe I love you so much
So much in fact that I don't know whether to weep or wind my watch
I have a sick sense of humor
It amazes me how points it scores
I'm addicted to vice
My best friends are pushers, my boyfriends are whores

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Simple to see why I breathe
No one bothers me completely

Waking up next to you
Your morning breath reminds me of Lucy
The flies in the front room
Buzz round my head and try to seduce me
If I contract illness
The last thing I want is to pass it to others
Fucking leaves guilt pangs
When I start forgetting the names of my lovers

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
