This is for my mother
From the older brother of your children, made of three
Now you found your lover
'Cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy

It's been a long five years
I've cried a thousand tears, and here we are after the war
But we're so much better
Now the skies are clearer, now there's no more slamming doors

Now, I say
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say

You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

This is for my father
From the older brother of your children made of three
Yeah, you've been so good to us
And showed us how to live and taught us to be free

But when Mother told you
That she didn't love you, all these bridges hit the sea
So you built another one
And helped us cross it, even though you were in need

Now, I say
Dear Father, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Father, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say

You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say
You cleared up my scars
