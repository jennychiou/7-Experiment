We used to talk forever on a dime
Now we live together, never find the time
We use to walk as lovers on the sand
Now we're working full time on our lifetime plan

We never stop to see the moon at night
We're just too busy leading complicated lives

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
Couldn't make our love stop
We were giving all that we got

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa

Look at us now, we're all grown up
We got it all together, got it all sown up
But is this all, it all was leading to
Do we just run out of dreams when all our dreams come true

Whatever happened to those endless nights
When we were happy living young and foolish lives

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
Couldn't make our love stop
We were giving all that we got

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa

We never stop to see the moon at night
We're just too busy leading complicated lives

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
Couldn't make our love stop
We were giving all that we got

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop

Whoa, whoa, whoa
---------------
Couldn't make our love stop
We were giving all that we got

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
