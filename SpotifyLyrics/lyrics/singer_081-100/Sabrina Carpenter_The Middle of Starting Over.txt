Oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Cast out to sea
Drifting with the tide
And no way of finding me
Now that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me

Awake from this dream
I hold my breath and just believe

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over

Oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Alone in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now this is home
Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah

As hard as it seems
I hold my breath and just believe

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

The colors and the stars
Seem a little brighter
Tomorrow isn't far away
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over

Oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
