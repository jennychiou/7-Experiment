While away the hours
In to something new
Throw away the flowers
They make you feel blue
 
Throwing stones at strangers
Waiting for the fight
Throwing stones at birds who struggle to take flight

I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
 
Get it out your system
Get it out of you
Send them home with blisters
Send them home, with truth
 
Send away the doubters
Blind them with with your hoof
Try to save the doubters
Try to sell good news
 
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain

I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain

I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain

I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
