"'Ed Sheeran"'
"We good to go?"

"'Taylor Swift"'
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now
I didn't before

And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like

I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now

"'Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran"'
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours all i know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

"'Ed Sheeran"'
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you.

"'Taylor Swift"'
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like

"'Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran"'
I just want to know you better
Klnow you better, now you better now
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now

I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

"'Taylor Swift"'
I just want to know you better
now you better, now you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

"'Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran"'
All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home
I know it is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed.

"'Taylor Swift"'
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know it is pouring rain

"'Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran"'
And everything has changed

"'Taylor Swift"'
All I know is a newfound grace
All my days I'll know your face
I know it since yesterday

"'Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran"'
Is everything has changed
