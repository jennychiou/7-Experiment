Big lights
People
Rushing to grow up before you know
Stop signs
Denied
Everyone tells me I gotta go slow

And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But nothing can change my mind

If I'm too young
To fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
If I'm too young
To know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

Rain drops
Deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing
Running
To a place where nobody says no

It's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly, yeah

If I'm too young
To fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
If I'm too young
To know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

'Cause I'm not too young, oh
Yeah

And if I'm too young
To fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
And if I'm too young
To know anything
Why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real, yeah
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young
