I've got a crush lalalalalala
Like a school girl
And I wanna rush lalalalalala
Like a fool would
So step on the gas lalalalalala
Come on over
Cos babe it's Christmas lalalalalala
I wanna know ya

Run to me
Run to me through the white night
Cos I adore ya
Run to me
Run to me through the white night
I'm waiting for ya

It's Christmas time so run for your life
Oh hallelujah
A snowy night
A woman on fire
I'm waiting for ya
So here we go under the mistletoe
Oh I adore ya
A snowy night
A woman on fire
Oh hallelujah

You and me here
Underneath the mistletoe
You and me here
Underneath the mistletoe
You and me here
Underneath the mistletoe
Under the mistletoe
Oh you and me here
Underneath the mistletoe
You and me here
Underneath the mistletoe
You and me here
Underneath the mistletoe
Under the mistletoe

Kiss me till dawn lalalalalala
Hold me close now
Come keep me warm lalalalalala
Keep the ghosts out

Run to me
Run to me through the white night
Cos I adore ya
Run to me
Run to me through the white night
I'm waiting for ya

It's Christmas time so run for your life
Oh hallelujah
A snowy night
A woman on fire

So here we go under the mistletoe
Oh I adore ya
A snowy night
A woman on fire
Oh hallelujah
