Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey Deanie you're the one
I'm dreamin' of

I was a fool for your love
From the moment I saw you
Like a vision in the darkness
Of a thousand lonesome, lonely nights
Like my heart threw away the key
I'm as blind as a man could be
Oh darlin'
Till you help me see the light

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey Deanie you're the one
I'm dreamin' of

I stand accused
I'm in league with the forces of darkness
An incurable believer
In the magic of the midnight sky
And the love that I found today
Oh, I can't let it slip away
Oh darlin', can't you read between the lines

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey Deanie you're the one
I'm dreamin' of

Deanie, love is all there is
I don't wanna lose it
Don't wanna let the evenin' go
If it's here within our reach
I think we should use it
Now while we're young enough
To still let it show

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey Deanie you're the one
I'm dreamin' of

Hey Deanie
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
Hey Deanie
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
Won't you come out tonight
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
I'm a fool for your love
Won't you come out
Come out tonight
