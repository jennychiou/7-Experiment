Fresh out of school, flyin' grade
We were born into the heart of a going age
We had nothing to lose, nothing to fall
We had only to give and we gave it all
Caught in a hurricane, now we're getting the sce-e-ene
 
Baby, caught in a teen dream (teen dream)
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Teen dream, teen dream
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
 
Too young to know-ow, to young to care
We we're riding on a dream and the love we share
So we played with our hearts, and mine and soul
Of a generation young, into rock 'n' roll
Caught in a hurricane, now we're getting the sce-e-ene
 
Baby, caught in a teen dream (teen dream)
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Teen dream, teen dream
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
 
Another night's sensation, we'll try for an explanation
Sensation (sensation), yeah-yeah-yeah
 
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Teen dream, teen dream
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Teen dream, teen dream
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Teen dream, teen dream
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Teen dream, teen dream
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
