This is a game already won
Your time has come
Stop trying

Take a break, you must be tired from the strain
Take a break, and let us carry your pain
Please slow down, you are making my head spin
Please slow down, you have all I have to give

This is a game, already won
The time has come
Stop trying

You don't know, you have everything you need
You won't grow, till you get down on your knees
Say good-bye, and do not dissect your lies
Say good-bye, there's no need to apologize

This is a game, already won
The time has come
Stop trying
