Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise, wipe the sleep out of my eyes
But tears of yesterday don't mean a thing

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good time starts and end without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?
