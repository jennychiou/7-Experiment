I need no other arms to hold me tight
I need no other lips to kiss goodnight
It's not hard to keep from going wrong
Cause darling you still turn me on

I still feel a thrill when you're close to me
You're still the one that means the most to me
When the day is through and we're alone
My darlin' you still turn me on

How I treasure every moment by your side
Tender lover how you keep me satisfied
The way you build me up and make me strong
Oh darling you still turn me on

How I treasure every moment by your side
Tender lover how you keep me satisfied
The way you build me up and make me strong
My darling you still turn me on
