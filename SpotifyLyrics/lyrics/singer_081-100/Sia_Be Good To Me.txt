He said darling don't forget
There is sweetness left unearthed for you and me
He said, honey no regrets
We just do our best and i... I just wanna cry
'Cause you'll be

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around
I'll be your every weather

He says, this is just today
It will be ok and I ...i am listening
He says, you can trust in me
You'll get all you'll need and how can I doubt you 'cause you'll be

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around
I'll be your every weather

You know what you do to me
You light up
You light up
The dark and,
You're all the good within me, my heart, is filled,
Rebuilt

Be good to me, be good to me
I need you now more than ever
I'm faithful, me, and when you're down
I'll be around
I'll be your every weather
