I thought I might begin by fillin' you in--
In case you didn't already know
I'll never forget how you got up and left
In fact it was downright pretty low
There ain't no way I wanna,
You know I ain't gonna
Take you back, so don't even try
You can beg, you can plead--
You can sweat, you can bleed
Too bad I could care if you cry

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun!
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted--
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet!
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then,
But would I do it all again--Nah--

You won't find me
Naked and cold justa sittin'
On the doctor's table
Witin' to be told justa why
I'm no longer able
To feel my heart beatin'--
Give me a good reason why!
I kinda went numb just around
About the time you told me
You were movin' on, and you
Said that you were gonna phone me
It's been so long, and there
Ain't nothin' wrong with the line

It's too late to regret it,
But you're the one who said it
We're better off being apart
I hate to be a downer,
But don't bother comin' 'round here
'Cause I won't have a change of heart

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun!
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted--
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet!
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then,
But would I do it again--Nah--

You won't find me
Naked and cold justa sittin'
On the doctor's table
Witin' to be told justa why
I'm no longer able
To feel my heart beatin'--
Give me a good reason why!
I kinda went numb just around
About the time you told me
You were movin' on, and you
Said that you were gonna phone me
It's been so long, and there
Ain't nothin' wrong with the line

Nah...

Well, I hope you learned a lesson,
'Cause you'll never be messin'
With my head again the way that you did
It was never gonna work;
You were too much of a jerk
I'm finally fed up with it

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun!
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted--
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet!
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then,
But would I do it all again--Nah--

You won't find me
