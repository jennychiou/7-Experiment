When I signed my deal
I felt pressure
Don't wanna see the numbers
I wanna see heaven
You say, could you write a song for me?
I say, I'm sorry I won't do that happily

When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see

I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love

I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

Please don't get me wrong
I wanna keep it moving
I know what that requires
I'm not foolish
Please, can you make this work for me?
'Cause I'm not a puppet, I will work against your strings

When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see

I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love

I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No I have no money on my mind

When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No I have no money on my mind

Just love

Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love

I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love
