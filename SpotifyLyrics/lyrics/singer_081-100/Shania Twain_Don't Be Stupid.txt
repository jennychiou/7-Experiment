You're so complicated - you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you'll see

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don't be stupid - you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don't be absurd - you know I want you
Don't be impossible

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
So don't be stupid - you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax - Max

Don't be stupid - you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don't be absurd - you know I want you
Don't be impossible

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
So don't be stupid - you know I love you

Don't be stupid - you're my baby

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
So don't be stupid - you know I love you

Don't be stupid - you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don't be absurd - you know I want you
Don't be impossible
