Should auld acquaintance be forgot, 
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, 
And auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear, 
For auld lang syne, 
We'll tak a cup of kindness yet, 
For auld lang syne! 

And there's a hand my trusty fiere, 

And gie's a hand o thine, 
And we'll tak a right guid-willie waught, 
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear, 
For auld lang syne, 
We'll tak a cup of kindness yet, 
For auld lang syne!
