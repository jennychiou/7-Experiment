You're not asking for much but
It just seems like a lot and
Kinda confused, don't know what to choose
But baby, it's hard for me
I'm not ready for your love

I keep on the go but
I don't mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees, you're begging me please
But darling, it's not the way
To get me, baby, no

Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we can be a thing
And I give you everything, love

Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

We can't get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you and you always knew
So baby, you pull away
And make me wait for you

So screw all that love -ish
I think that I've had it
The more you turn your back, then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time I play this game
Always the same, and I'm through

Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we can be a thing
And I give you everything, love

Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

Sometimes
'Cause love feels like loneliness sometimes

Love feels like loneliness (Sometimes)
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
