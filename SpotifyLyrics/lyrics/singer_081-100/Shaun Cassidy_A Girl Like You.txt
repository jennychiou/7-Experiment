I don't know what it's all about
But I feel I"ll soon find out, I'm sure, never felt this secure
It's nothin' like I ever thought it would be
Someone opened up a door for me
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
Must be you that could cause this feelin' in me (must be you)
You that fills me confidently (must be you)
You that brings the best out in me
You... woh-oh-oh-oh-oh, nobody but you
 
I don't know what it's all about
I can't begin to figure out what to do, so I leave it to you
I only know that when you're away from me
Nothin' satisfies the need in me
For a girl like you (I'm in love with)
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
Must be you that could cause this feelin' in me (must be you)
You that fills me confidently (must be you)
You that brings the best out in me
You... woh-oh-oh-oh-oh, nobody but you
Nobody but you
 
Every time I'm holdin' you clo-ose to me
Trouble's gone, it's gone, I'm in ecstasy-y
With a gir-ir-irl (I'm in love with)
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
Ooh, yeah-eah (I'm in love with)
A little girl like you (I'm in love with)
Must be you-ou-ou (I'm in love with)
Make me feel this way-ay (I'm in love with)
Yay-yay-yay-hay, yay-yay-hay (I'm in love with)
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
Ooh, a girl like you (I'm in love with)
A girl you you-ou (I'm in love with)
