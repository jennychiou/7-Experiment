As I approach the prime of my life I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure all the simple pleasures
And so I happily concede this is all I ask this is all I need

Beautiful girl, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunset, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange enchanted land grownups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song for me to sing
And I will stay younger, oh I will be younger
Yes I will stay younger than spring
