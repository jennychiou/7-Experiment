When the air is filled with twinkling bells
And the trees are white with crusty shells
When the frost is on the windowpane
It's December time again

When the snowflakes cover up the sky
And little faces breathe a happy sigh
Old man winter's here to entertain
It's December time again

The mistletoe that's growing
Will soon be picked for showing
That lovers like this season of the year
Those sleigh rides so exciting
The fancy colored lighting
Are certain signs the yule tide's growing near

When the woodman fells the evergreen
And little carollers appear upon the scene
And the heaven's echo their refrain
It's December time again
