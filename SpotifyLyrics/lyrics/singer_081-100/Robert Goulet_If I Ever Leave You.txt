Oh, no, not in springtime
Summer, winter or fall
No, never could I leave you at all

If ever I would leave you
It wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer
I never would go

Your hair streaked with sunlight
Your lips red as flame
Your face with a luster
That puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you
It couldn't be in autumn
How I'd leave in autumn
I never will know

I've seen how you sparkle
When fall nips the air
I know you in autumn
And I must be there

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow?
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow?

If ever I would leave you
How could it be in springtime?
Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so?

Oh, no, not in springtime
Summer, winter or fall
No, never could I leave you at all
