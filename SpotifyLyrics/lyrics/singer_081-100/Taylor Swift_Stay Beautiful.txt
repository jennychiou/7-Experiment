Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So, I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation,
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say,
Hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story,
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but, if it don't

Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Oh, if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
