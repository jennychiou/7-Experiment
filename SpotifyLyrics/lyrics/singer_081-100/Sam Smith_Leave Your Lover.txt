I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
What use is money, when you need someone to hold
Don't have direction I'm just rolling down this road
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything, don't you see what I can bring
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight terror free, I will give you all of me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
I'm in love with you and you will never know
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow
You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

Pack up and leave everything, don't you see what I can bring
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight terror free, I will give you all of me
Leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me
