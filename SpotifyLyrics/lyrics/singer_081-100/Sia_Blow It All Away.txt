Without a sound ever heard
Without a lesson I've learned
You're foolish
And diluted

Too many lies have you burned
Where there's eyes to be found
This seems life's underground

But even if you had it all
You would find
I could never let you stay

'Cause you blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away

If you go
I will stall

Yes I see it
Yes I feel it
You have no questions at all

But if life is truly devoured
I'll strip your bare 'til truth comes out

But even if you had it all
You would find
You blow it all

You blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away
(Repeat) 

Forever is your mind to be naive 
Remember 
It will bring us to our knees 
You blow it all away

'Cause even if you had it all
You would find
You blow it all

You blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away
(Repeat)
