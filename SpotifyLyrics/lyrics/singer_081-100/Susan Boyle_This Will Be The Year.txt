Toast to me, hold up my glass, to all mistakes I've made.
Good intentions washed away, as soon as spring time came.
I danced a summer, fell an autumn, another candle blown.
Now winter's come around again, and back where I began.
And even though you heard it all, I know you don't believe.
Let me keep the last thing left for me.
This will be the year, the year

The year I learn to take some time, to stop and breathe it in.
To keep a promise to myself, to finish what I begin.
Bad habits stop, no more regrets, a step out of the red.
Open arms and an open heart to all that lies ahead.
And even though you've heard it all, and I know you don't believe,
Let me keep the last thing left for me.
This will be the year, the year.

My faith carries me, I'll keep holding on.
And I will (?) to find me, what I've been doing wrong.
I know you don't believe, but just for me, can't you pretend?
That you'll never ever hear me say these words again.

I know this time I won't be late, this time I will arrive.
Save my tears, save my doubts, this time I will try.
I know I can be better, I promise I'll be strong.
I'll make (?) where I had been, seeing all alone.
I know you've heard it all before, and I know you don't believe,
But let me keep the last thing left for me.
This will be the year, the year.
