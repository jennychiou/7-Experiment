Jump in me old jeep wagon bump it to the banks of the river
Dig me a worm and a cricket squirm and a wade out into the water

Oh oh goodbye google eye eat him up a google eye
Eat him up a google eye google google eye goodbye google eye

Bait me a hook in the morning throw him out into the water
Make him swim with a dorsal fin and come home to me lover

Oh oh goodbye google eye...

Google eye swim by me hipboot look up at me from the water
Google eye chomp and me fall on me romp but me get him up out of the water

Ha ha goodbye yeah google eye...

Google eye fry in the sizzle sweet smoke lay on the water
Take ol' google eye's scales and tails and take 'em home to my lover

Oh oh goodbye google eye...
