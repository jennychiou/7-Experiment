Come with me to a place of fantasy
I'll take you on a see-saw
Come with me to a place that's by the sea
I'll take you on a boardwalk

Take my hand I'll take you to the sand
You and me will build a castle
Ready, set, go, I'll race you to the wall
I will win, I am the fastest

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime

I'll be sure to write you from the war
Put your guns away, it's tea time
Water bombs and tea towel tired moms
Looking for a little me time

Close your eyes and count to thirty five
You may never, ever find me
Close my eyes and then I realize
You are never far behind me, oh

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime

Let's have fun, let's play out under the sun
Will you take me by the hand?
Let's see how far we can run, yeah
Let's play chase, let's put makeup on our face
You can catch me if you can
We can make a secret place

"(Meet me at the playground)"
Let's have fun, let's play out under the sun
Will you take me by the hand?
Let's see how far we can run, yeah

"(Come with me, fool around)"
Let's play chase let's put makeup on our face
You can catch me if you can
We can make a secret place

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime

I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime
