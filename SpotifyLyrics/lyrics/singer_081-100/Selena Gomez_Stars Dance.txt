Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name, I'll never leave the room
Night and day, I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Don't be afraid, close your eyes
Let me take you to places you've never been tonight
I thought by know you'd realize I can do anything I put my mind to

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
It's dead steady, there's falling and flying in love
Nothing's forever because we are just stars, dance

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

I can make the stars dance
I can make the stars dance
I can make, I can make, I can make the stars dance

The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you
