Don't wanna wait in line--uh, uh
It's such a waste of time--uh, uh, uh
Won't find me on the couch--uh, uh
Sleepin' like a slouch--uh, uh, uh

I don't like sittin' down doin' nothin'
I'd rather spend my time doin' somethin'
Ain't no need to plan it--
Jump right in and jam it
No need to say no--oh, oh, oh

(I'm not in the mood) I'm not in the mood
(I'm not in the mood) To be shy--
To stand by--and not give it a try
No, I'm not in the mood
(I'm not in the mood) To stay home--
Be alone--face the night on my own
No, I'm not in the mood (to say)--
To say--(to say)--to say no!

I won't be layin' low--uh, uh
It's not my style to take it slow--uh, uh, uh
No, it ain't like me to slack--uh, uh
There's no time for holdin' back--
Uh, uh, uh

I won't be sittin' down doin' nothin'
I'd rather spend my time doin' somethin'
Ain't no need to plan it--
Jump right in and jam it
No need to say no--oh, oh, oh
Uh

(I'm not in the mood) I'm not in the mood
(I'm not in the mood) To be shy--
To stand by--and not give it a try
No, I'm not in the mood
(I'm not in the mood) To stay home--
Be alone--face the night on my own
No, I'm not in the mood (to say)--
To say--(to say)--to say no!

Uh, uh, mmmm
Ha, ha
I'm jumpin' right in
Oh, yeah, huh
Jumpin' right in
Uh, I'd rather spend my time doin'
Somethin'
I won't be sittin' 'round doin' nothin'
Ain't no need to plan it--
Jump right in and jam it
No need to say no--oh, oh, oh, uh

(I'm not in the mood) I'm not in the mood
(I'm not in the mood) To be shy--
To stand by--and not give it a try
No, I'm not in the mood
(I'm not in the mood) To stay home--
Be alone--face the night on my own
No, I'm not in the mood (to say)--
To say--(to say)--to say no!
