I think it's time that I be honest
Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all

You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy

It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I will go down in history together, yeah
And does your sister ask about me?
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?

You're with somebody I can't be
But I can tell that you're happy

It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do
I wish I had you

But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one that get me through
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had you
