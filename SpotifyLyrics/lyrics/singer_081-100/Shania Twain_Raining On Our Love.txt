Remember me the way I was
The way I'd make you late for work
I had to hold you, just because

Remember you the way you'd wake me up
To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show 

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love
