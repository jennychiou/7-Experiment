Look into your eyes I see battlefields
Storming through your heart
It's hard to tell you how I feel
What's been wrong
See the silence in the room keeps raging on

Bring it back to the moment
Bring it back to the moment
We're so out of focus
We're so out of focus
Bring it back to the moment
Where the love kept us going
Before the goodbyes
Now you're out of my life

Skydiving to get back to you
Skydiving with nothing to lose
Skydiving, defy gravity
Skydiving, skydiving

Make it disappear what's pulling us apart
I don't know where you are
Even though you're next to me
You're gone, somewhere else
So I come back down to get to you

Bring it back to the moment
Bring it back to the moment
We're so out of focus
We're so out of focus
Bring it back to the moment
Where the love kept us going
Before the goodbyes
Now you're out of my life

Skydiving to get back to you
Skydiving with nothing to lose
Skydiving, defy gravity
Skydiving, skydiving

Bring it back to the moment
Where the love kept us going
Bring it back to the moment
Where the love kept us going

Skydiving to get back to you
Skydiving with nothing to lose
Skydiving, defy gravity
Skydiving, skydiving

Bring it back to the moment
Bring it back to the moment
We're so out of focus
We're so out of focus
Bring it back to the moment
Where the love kept us going
Where love kept us going

Skydiving
