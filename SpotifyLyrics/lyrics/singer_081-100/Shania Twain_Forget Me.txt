Don't go around talkin' to your friends about me
Bury the past, just let it rest in peace
Leave well enough alone
Treat me like someone you've never known

Forget me
Like you forgot to come home at night
Forget me
Like you forgot to hold me tight
(Well) now you're sorry, now you cry
But don't you wipe those tears
'Til your memories run dry
Please forget me

Don't let the lonely days remind you of anything
Oh baby try to erase the fact we had everything
No you can't come back this time
So let me slip right out of your mind

Forget me
Like you forgot to come home at night
Forget me
Like you forgot to hold me tight
(Well) now you're sorry, now you cry
But don't you wipe those tears
'Til your memories run dry
Please forget me
'Cause I forgot to forgive and forget
So just pretend we never met

Forget me
Like you forgot to come home at night
Forget me
Like you forgot to hold me tight
(Well) now you're sorry, now you cry
But don't you wipe those tears
'Til your memories run dry
Please forget me

Baby, please forget me
Forget me
