For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know, I'll be strong

Once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dream come true

For once in my life, I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once I have something, I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once I can say, "This is mine, you can't take it"
Long as I know, I have love I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

For once I can say, "This is mine, you can't take it"
Long as I know, I have love I can make it
For once I can feel that somebody's [Incomprehensible]
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
