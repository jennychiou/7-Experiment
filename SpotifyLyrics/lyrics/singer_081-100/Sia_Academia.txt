You can be my alphabet and I will be your calculator
And together we'll work out on the escalator
I will time you as you run up the down
And you'll measure my footsteps as I blow through this town

The mean of our heights is divided by the nights
Which is times'd by the daggers and the root of all our fights
The pass of your poem is to swathe me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it

Oh, academia you can't pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

I am a dash and you are a dot
When will you see that I am all that you've got?
I'm binary code that you cracked long ago
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you'd never wrote

I'm greater than x and lesser than y
So why is it that I still can't catch your eye?
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I sit here drawing circles, I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh, academia you can't pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen has over-analysed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number you're infinity plus one
And if I am four words then I am needing of your love

Oh, academia you can't pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love

Oh, academia, academia, academia
Oh, academia, academia, academia
