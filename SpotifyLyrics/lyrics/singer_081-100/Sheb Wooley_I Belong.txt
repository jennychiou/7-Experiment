Their faith was great in the new frontier
They built their schools and churches here
They loved this land and called it home

As I look from the hills at the green land below
My faith in the future is strong
Oh I feel the thrill and my heart is filled
For I know that I belong

Where the soil and the sun are my treasure
And the wind in the trees is my song
Let me live and die neath this clear blue sky
For I know that I belong

Where the soil and the sun are my treasure
