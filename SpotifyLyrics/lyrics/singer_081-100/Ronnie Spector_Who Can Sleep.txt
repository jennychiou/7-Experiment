Love, when you're holding me so tight
I believe I can love you all my life
Like a dream, I can scream, I can feel your heartbeat
Come, take me through this velvet night

Every time we dance, drives me crazy
Say that I'm your man (say it baby)
When we feel this way, who can sleep?

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you feel the heat?
Friday night comes once a week, who can sleep?
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, 'cause you look so sweet
Love me baby all night long, tell me who can sleep?

I hear the music everywhere
Tonight there's magic in the air
Feel the fire of desire shadows in the moonlight
Come, take me through this velvet night

Every time we dance, drives me crazy
Say that I'm your man (say it baby)
When we feel this way, who can sleep?

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, I can feel the heat?
When you hear the music play, who can sleep?

My body's shaking with sensation
No time for hesitation
It's too late to run for cover
The night was meant for lovers

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you feel the heat?
Love me baby all night long, tell me who can sleep?
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, you kiss so sweet
Love me baby all night long, who can sleep?

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you feel the heat?
Friday night comes once a week, tell me who can sleep?
