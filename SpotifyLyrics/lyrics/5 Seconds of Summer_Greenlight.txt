It started with a picture,
Those messages you sent to me,
You're like the perfect mixture,
Of Megan Fox and Katy.

It's such a sick obsession,
And now you've got the best of me,
I've got the worst intentions,
So call me over set me free.

I can give you what you want.

It's taking me over,
I don't wanna play this game no more,
All you gotta do is tell me right now,
You want me right now, come on,
Give me the green light,
We could have all night,
If you just say the word,
Tell me it's alright,
Give me the green light.

You got me where you want me,
I'm hanging on your every word,
It's such a twisted story,
How you got me,
How you got me.

Let me give you what you need.

It's taking me over,
I don't wanna play this game no more,
All you gotta do is tell me right now,
You want me right now, come on,
Give me the green light,
We could have all night,
If you just say the word,
Tell me it's alright,
Give me the green light.

Let me give you what you need.

It's taking me over,
I don't wanna play this game no more,
All you gotta do is tell me right now,
You want me right now, come on,
Give me the green light,
We could have all night,
If you just say the word,
Tell me it's alright,
Give me the green light.
