Ohoh Yeah

Remember we'd be up all night
Talking till the morning light, yeah
Like the way it used to be
Those simple days
Just you and me, mm

I see you baby I know
What's on your mind
'Cause you look like you've
Got something to say, yeah

I may not say those words anymore
But maybe it just ain't my way

You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked a question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you

Remember we used to laugh and say
No one understood our way
And there were times
When you would cry
While knocking
On my door
I was there
To shelter your pain, oh

I feel you baby
Get that off your mind
Make it to
A brighter day

I may not say those words anymore
But maybe I can make it my way, yeah, oh

You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you

The answer girl
Lies within your heart
Please take a look inside

You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies

You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you

In you, in you
The answer lies in you

In you, in you
The answer lies in you
