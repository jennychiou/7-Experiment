When I'm all broke down, heading for disaster
And I'm standing down trying to find a clue
And my head is tired searching for the answers
Can't figure out how I'm gonna get through the next ten minutes

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your fate can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your fate can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh

When I'm all broke down, need a place to run to
No one hears me shout lost and all alone
And I'm losing ground, no one understands me
Can't figure out what I'm gonna do 'cause I just can't take it

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your fate can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your fate can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh

(RAP)

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your fate can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your fate can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh
