I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you

I've been gone so long
I'm used to feelin' alone
I estimated our love
My estimation was wrong
See I never knew what you were goin' through
But I've just got back
Now I see where you're at
How could you tell that I would ever be distracted by
Any other guy no matter if he ever caught my eye?
We just need time
Some time to connect
What I'm tellin' you now
Hope you never forget it

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me to be the one
The only one you wanna run to
Baby boy you know I've just begun to realize what's important to me
So don't leave
Don't leave

Maybe I shoud have tried to put your needs first but my priorities were messed up and I know you got hurt
See I never knew what you were going through
But I just got back
Now let's see where you're at
Think about it
Take a moment just to rewind
Everything that you believe and everything that was right
Do you really want to stand there and tell me goodbye
When I'm sayin' I still love you?

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me to be the one
The only one you wanna run to
Baby boy you know I've just begun to realize what's important to me
So don't leave
Don't leave

Lonely days and lonely nights
That's where you'll be without me by your side
Better think twice, baby
This could grow up crazy, you know
I can't keep sayin' my secret 'cause it's out of control
I gave you everything: Body, mind, heart and soul
But you keep breaking me, taking me to another low
Don't do it baby
Don't do it
Don't let me go

I Don't know
I Don't know

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me to be the one
The only one you wanna run to
Baby boy you know I've just begun to realize what's important to me
So don't leave
Don't leave

Baby boy, Don't leave
