La da da da dee, you're not breaking me
La de da da da, ain't got time for ya
La da da da dee, you won't shatter me
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile

Somebody told me fame is a disease
You start singing the blues when you start seeing the green
But I think it's all about what you choose
The way you live your life, depends on you
That's when I realized I wanna make a difference
Change other people's lives, give hope, even for a moment
Use my name for good and change the game I could
Because to make it you think I gotta act a certain way,
Be a little bit insane, live a little, it's okay
I guess we have different definitions of living, but you'll twist my words anyway
You'll say that I'm naive, like I don't have a past,
You're the one being deceived, I see right behind the mask/match
Tryna to stir me up and get me mad
I smile because happiness is all I have

La da da da dee, you're not breaking me
La de da da da, ain't got time for ya
La da da da dee, you won't shatter me
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile

You see me hanging with my fam, it don't mean I'm living in a bubble
You'll find me at church, but that don't mean I can't cause trouble
So stir up a little scene 'cause isn't that what you want
For me to mess up, so you can dress up
Some stories saying, Tori this'll sell more records
But I'd rather make'em yawn than be a pawn on your chessboard
So call me boring, call me cookie cutter
Or what you wanna matter of fact
Just say it loud and don't st-stutter
'Cause I know who I am, I'm still the same
Just a California girl with big dreams
Thinking maybe they'll let me sing songs about real things
But baby who knows maybe I can sell out shows without taking off my clothes
God made me sexy I don't care if only I know

La da da da dee, you're not breaking me
La de da da da, ain't got time for ya
La da da da dee, you won't shatter me
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile

Ooh Oh
Ooh Oh

Used to be easy to break me down
But now all I ever wanna do is smile
Yeah an unbreakable smile
So say what you want about me
I'm still gonna be the same old me
Ain't got time for you no more no more
Got an unbreakable smile
