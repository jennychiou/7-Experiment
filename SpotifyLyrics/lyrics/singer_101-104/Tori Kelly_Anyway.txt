If I said I'm difficult sometimes
Say whatever comes to my mind
Would you stay with me any anyway?
If you knew I made a lot of noise
Say whatever just to make my point
Would you stay with me any anyway?

Well this is the only Tori that I know how to be
Sorry if that don't fit your reality
I'm giving one hundred percent of me 
So take it or leave
Whether you're in or out
This is what I'm about

Because I'm up
I'm down
I'm left
I'm right
Imma be myself all day and night
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
I'll do my own thing and that's alright
It's the way I choose to live my life
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway

If I said I'm gonna make you wait
I don't mean it but I'm always late
Would you stay with me any anyway?
If I see you getting out of line
Best believe I'm gonna handle mine
Would you stay with me any anyway?

Well this is the only Tori that I know how to be
Sorry if that don't fit your reality
I'm giving one hundred percent of me 
So take it or leave
Whether you're in or out
This is what I'm about

Because I'm up
I'm down
I'm left
I'm right
Imma be myself all day and night
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
I'll do my own thing and that's alright
It's the way I choose to live my life
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway

Where to begin?
I'm too full in my skin
I don't smoke, I drink
You act like it's a sin
But while you're out partyin' with men and women who be pretendin'
I'm cool with being different while you hipsters blend in
My heads full of dreams
And I feel like livin' them
While you're messin' with perfection
Inspiration's what I'm chasin'
And take it or leave it babe
I'm not gonna change
If you don't understand I don't need you anyway

I'm the only Tori that I know how to be
Sorry if that don't fit your reality
I'm giving one hundred percent of me 
So take it or leave
Whether you're in or out
This is what I'm about

Because I'm up
I'm down
I'm left
I'm right
Imma be myself all day and night
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
I'll do my own thing and that's alright
It's the way I choose to live my life
Whether you leave or stay
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway
Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
This is me any anyway
