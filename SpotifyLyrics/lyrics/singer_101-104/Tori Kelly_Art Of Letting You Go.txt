We were just little kids, we were ambiguous
My crush was serious, it's crazy how
As we were growing up, I could just set you up
But it just wasn't love, I guess it starts
Never a life for us, life just snuck up on us
You got a girlfriend and stuff, feelings are bottled up
Hide 'em in this song, took the key and locked it up
But when I see you again, no, I can't even pretend

It's always you I go back to; I know it's danger
It's always you my heart runs to, but I'm a stranger
Baby, what happened? What am I to do?
Wanna move on, but I'm scared of losing you
I can't seem to master the art of letting you go
No, I can't seem to master the art of letting you go

Try not to dwell on it, but sometimes I can't help it
So I paint pictures of it
Even when I was always on the road, I was always doing shows
Yeah, my life was never slow, don't you know?
Your love stayed in the back of my head
In a house full of a memories is where I lived
Right when I came home, oh no, there I go
Saw you again and I can't even pretend

It's always you I go back to; I know it's danger
It's always you my heart runs to, but I'm a stranger
Baby, what happened? What am I to do?
Wanna move on, but I'm scared of losing you
I can't seem to master the art of letting you go
No, I can't seem to master the art of letting you go

Not letting you go
It's just the art of letting you go

All of me, I give you everything
If you could only see how much you mean to me
I know you'll always me the one that stays with me, haunting me
And maybe I'll ever know just how to let you go

It's always you I go back to; I know it's danger
It's always you my heart runs to, but I'm a stranger
Baby, what happened? What am I to do?
Wanna move on, but I'm scared of losing you
I can't seem to master the art of letting you go
No, I can't seem to master the art of letting you go

I'm wishing that I could be happy with you
(Just the art of letting you go)
With you, with you, with you
