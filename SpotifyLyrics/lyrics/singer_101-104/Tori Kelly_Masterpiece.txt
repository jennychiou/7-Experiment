It's so crazy to me
How mistakes can be
A blessing in disguise
Lord, I'm so glad You're making me
A masterpiece
Masterpiece (oh Lord)

Hit me
When you look at me
Do you see a work of art in the making?
Sketch of what I've been
Wonder what you see in me
Like what do you think?
When my life is not a melody in the morning
And I feel off key, yeah
Do you still believe in me?
Like a symphony, hey
You know how to make all things work together
Crazy how mistakes can be miracles in disguise

That's why tonight I pray
Don't take your love away
Forever in your embrace
Without You I'm like a storm with no wind
Tossed by the wind and sea
And when I'm incomplete
Just one request from me
God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your masterpiece

When you look at me
Do I make you smile like what your creating?
Working patiently with me
'Preciate that I am with You're time
'Cause I want to be, aye
Be the stone that You turn in to Your treasure
Crazy how mistakes can be miracles in disguise

That's why tonight I pray
Don't take your love away
Forever in your embrace
Without You I'm like a storm with no wind
Tossed by the wind and sea
And when I'm incomplete
Just one request from me
God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your masterpiece

Is what I want to be

So I pray, don't take Your love away
That's why tonight I pray
Don't take your love away
Forever in your embrace
Without You I'm like a storm with no wind
Tossed by the wind and sea
And when I'm incomplete
Just one request from me
God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your master

Uh, now you know that You're a masterpiece
You probably feel like a catastrophe
You in the mirror everyday saying "uh" like Master P
Ain't really how it have to be
Now hold up (listen)
You acting totally different
You gotta a whole new position
You are the running Bobby Ricky whole new addition
You think I'm kidding but hold up a minute
Don't compare yourself with none of them
You wanna wanna ain't no synonym
A master artist take a mess and make a masterpiece
And look at you, you been a gem (facts)
Shinin'

God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your masterpiece
