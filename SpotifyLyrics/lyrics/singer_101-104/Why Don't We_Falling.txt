Girls like you, they just don't understand
Didn't mean harm but you killed a man
Loving you never was in the plan
Stuck in your ways, I sink in your sand

I swear I saw you comin'
I'mma hope for one, yeah
You don't wanna be rushed
You don't wanna be touched
It's a shame girls like you don't know how to love
Try to give you my all, but it's not enough

Can't you see that I'm falling
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you
Show me where your heart is
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you
Can't you see that I'm on this, and I want this
Can't believe that I'm falling, like this for you
Can't you see that I'm falling
I'm falling, falling for you

Ooh, ooh, ooh (falling, falling)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (falling, falling)

And it's crazy the things that we'll do for us
But the stars don't align, they're not here for us
It's a shame girls like you don't know how to trust
Wish my feelings would turn 'round from love to lust

I swear I saw you comin'
I'mma hope for one, yeah
You don't wanna be rushed
You don't wanna be touched
It's a shame girls like you don't know how to love
Try to give you my all but it's not enough

Can't you see that I'm falling
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you
Show me where your heart is
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you
Can't you see that I'm on this, and I want this
Can't believe that I'm falling, like this, for you
Can't you see that I'm falling
I'm falling, falling for you

In my dreams, in my hopes
In my mind they remind me of you
Should've left when I could, can't get out
I don't know what to do

You can dig my grave, 'cause I can't be saved
Like a grain of sand that's in a tide, away
In a broken place, no I can't be traced
With your hand on my feelings and better ways

Can't you see that I'm falling (falling, falling for)
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you
Show me where your heart is (oh, oh)
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you (ooh)
Can't you see that I'm on this, and I want this
Can't believe that I'm falling, like this for you
Can't you see that I'm falling
I'm falling, falling for you

I'm falling for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh (falling, falling)
I'm falling for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh (falling, falling)
