Hold on to anything just so you don't crash
Fought off the empty lies that once ruled your past
Right when you think you've won jump three steps back
So now you find yourself stuck in your own trap
They try to dirty up your name
But it's all a game
Baby you don't have to know exactly who you are
Because figuring it all out could be the best part

Don't quit your daydream
Don't forget to breathe
Who you want to be is only up to you
Sometimes you may crawl
Let them think that you're small
'Cause it's so worth the fall when you land where you want to

Tried almost everything still spinning around
But one thing you haven't tried is erase every doubt
Keep both feet on the ground while your head's in the clouds
And when you feel like giving up listen to these sounds
And make sure you

Don't quit your daydream
Don't forget to breathe
Who you want to be is only up to you
Sometimes you may crawl
Let them think that you're small
'Cause it's so worth the fall when you land where you want to

You don't have to know exactly
Who you are just let your heart lead
It's so worth the trials that you're going through
So just enjoy the fall and you'll land right where you want to

Don't quit your daydream (just take it slow)
Don't forget to breathe
Who you want to be is only up to you
Sometimes you may crawl (and you're gonna get back up again)
Let them think that you're small
'Cause it's so worth the fall when you land where you want to

Baby don't you ever quit it

Baby you don't have to know exactly who you are
Because figuring it all out could be the best part
