I'm just a girl and her guitar
Trying to give you my whole heart
If there's anybody out there listening to me
All I have is a story and a dream
Here I am, and that's all I can be

You know I forget to breathe sometimes
And I'm so afraid to fall behind
Why do I let the pressure take over my mind?
When I know the truth is never wrong
I'm alright, this is right where I belong
