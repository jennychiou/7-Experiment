I look at you and I know you're trouble
I should run just fast as I can
Yeah! One smile, game over, here in front of you I stand

I know your only gonna burst my bubble
Trouble is, my heart don't care
It's ignoring all the danger signs
Stop, slow down, take a deep breath, beware

I'm not willing to be so fearless, careless, just yet
'Cause once bitten twice shy, is what you get

My heart's got a mind of its own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
'Cause when it breaks I break
I don't know - how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way

Too many times I've witnessed
My heart make a fool of it s self
So sure it's gonna turn out one way
Always turns out being somethin' else

My heart's got a real malfunction
Always flippin' into override
When I tell it to be sensible
Uh! It overrules my cynical mind

I'm not willing to be so open, transparent, no not yet
'Cause once bitten twice shy, is what you get
But here in front of you, there's nothin' I can do

Stop, slow down, take a deep breath, (breath) think about what I'm doin'
Think about once bitten, twice shy
Stop, slow down, take second, (breath) before you rust right in
It's gonna be my tears you cry
