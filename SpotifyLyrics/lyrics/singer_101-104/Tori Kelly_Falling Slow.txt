I'm not a queen, I'm not a saint
I'm not an angel
Sometimes I'm wrong, I can be bad
Act like a stranger

But here I am, just a lot of broken pieces
I don't plan to leave and break your heart

What if I messed up? Would you give up on us?
Would you tear the page out like it never ever happened?
What if I told you you're doing fine? Stay cool
Swear I'll make it worthwhile, baby
You should know I'm always falling slow in love
Slow in love
Falling slow in love

Yeah, I tried to be the girl you need
Your one and only
From time to time, I lose my mind
But don't you worry

But here I am, just a lot of broken pieces
I don't plan to leave and break your heart

What if I messed up? Would you give up on us?
Would you tear the page out like it never ever happened?
What if I told you you're doing fine? Stay cool
Swear I'll make it worthwhile, baby
You should know I'm always falling slow in love (oh)
Slow in love (I'm falling)
Falling slow in love

Falling slow (slow) yeah
Oh (falling slow) mmm

Oh, what if I messed up? Would you give up on us?
Would you, would you, would you...? Oh
What if I told you you're doing fine? Stay cool (stay cool)
Swear I'll make it worthwhile, baby
You should know I'm always falling slow in love (oh)
Slow in love (I'm falling)
Falling slow in love

Falling slow in love
Slow in love
Falling slow
