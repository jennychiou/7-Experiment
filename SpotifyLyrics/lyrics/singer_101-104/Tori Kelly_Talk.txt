People talk, people talk
But they don't wanna say what they're really trying to say
Hopes and fears, smoke and mirrors
Save all the thinking, words by themselves they just fade

People run, people walk
But they don't ever see past the world that they're in
So if it's talk that you want from me then maybe you should let me in

Oh, you keep saying you won't let me go
Oh, you keep saying what I've heard before
Talk

Playing with empty hearts, leading words felt like they're just going no where now
So if it's talk that you want from me then maybe you should let me in

Oh, you keep saying you won't let me go
Oh, you keep saying what I've heard before
Oh, you keep saying you won't let me go

All I hear is talk

I know all about you, know all about you
Know all about you

You keep saying you won't let me go
Talk

Oh, you keep saying you won't let me go
Talk
Oh, you keep saying you won't let me go
Talk
You keep saying things I've heard before babe
Heard before babe
Talk
