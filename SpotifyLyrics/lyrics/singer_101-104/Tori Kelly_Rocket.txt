If I could build a rocket I would
Put all my dreams inside it I would
Maybe I could travel far into something new
Hang onto a shooting star bursting into view
Just me and my fickle heart lonely never felt so right
I would go anywhere tonight

If I could be a pilot I would
Unlock the sky see what's inside it I would
'Cause everyone's out doing things and I'm stuck in my room
But if this bed grew some wings then what could I not do
Just me and my fickle heart lonely never felt so right
I would go anywhere tonight

Ooh
Ooh

If I could build a rocket I would
I would go anywhere tonight
I would go anywhere tonight
Mmhhmm
I would go anywhere
