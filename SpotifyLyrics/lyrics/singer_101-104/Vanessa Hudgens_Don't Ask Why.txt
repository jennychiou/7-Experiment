I remember the day I first met you
You really caught my attention
Didn't know I was looking for a rescue
I wasn't thinking that hard

Now and then I was there in the moment
I was ready for nothing
Doesn't mean that I really didn't love you
While I'm breaking your heart

Don't ask why before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye, it's easier this way
Don't ask why before you ask some question
And I die inside, just let me walk away

I feel bad that I let my past hurt you
'Cause I really didn't mean to
I was lost, I was lucky you found me
But it only got worse

Right now while you're looking right at me
The emotion still scares me
Doesn't mean that I really didn't love you
When I'm making you hurt

Don't ask why before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye, it's easier this way
Don't ask why before you ask some question
And I die inside, just let me walk away

I know I want this more than ever
I wish there was another way
You see my words can only hurt you
Till his shadow fades away

Don't ask why before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye, it's easier this way
Don't ask why before you ask some question
And I die inside, just let me walk away

Don't ask why before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye, it's easier this way
Don't ask why before you ask some question
And I die inside, just let me walk away
