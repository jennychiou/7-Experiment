Beautiful
You are stronger than you know
Oh, you're something beautiful

Know you're hurting and you feel like all is lost
Heart is burning from the love that's been cut off
But day light comes in and time for you is all I got
And I promise you'll get through this, you can do this

Because all that you need
Is a little room to breathe

Breathe in and let it go, oh
Your tears are not for nothing
Let them fall off
In every tear drop there is something beautiful, oh
You are stronger than you know, oh
Oh you're something beautiful

Fighting shadows, in a game that you can't win
Losing battles, in a war under your skin
It's just a blessing in disguise
Without darkness, there is no light
Just hold on a little longer, and I promise you'll get through this

Because all that you need
Is a little room to breathe

Breathe in and let it go, oh
Your tears are not for nothing
Let them fall off
In every tear drop there is something beautiful, oh
You are stronger than you know, oh
Oh you're something beautiful

Can't feel the love without the pain
The sun wouldn't matter without the rain
You're not required to carry the weight
So let it go, here's my hand to hold
At the end of it all, there's a smile for you waiting
So...

Breathe in and let it go, oh
Your tears are not for nothing
Let them fall off
In every tear drop there is something beautiful, oh
You are stronger than you know, oh
Oh you're something beautiful

(Let it go, let it go)
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(You're something beautiful baby, and you better believe that)
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(You deserve it all)
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(Don't let them tell you you're not
Just give it all that you got
'Cause you are more than enough
You're something beautiful)
