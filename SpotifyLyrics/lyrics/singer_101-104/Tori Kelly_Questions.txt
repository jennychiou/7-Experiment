I heard that there are seasons
To laugh and to cry
I struggle with the season
When you lived and you died
It's hard to play this game
Because the rules, they don't seem fair
If you care, God if You're still there

Bombs falling in Syria
A child dying of AIDS
Fighting 'round the world
A daddy lost his girl
Still we kneeled and prayed
But Heaven can feel silent
And the floor beneath gets cold
When your soul refuses to let go

But wait, tell me am I too late?

What happens when the healing never comes?
Do we stand and curse the heavens
Or lift our hands and feel the sun
The mystery's not clear
Just once, your voice I'd love to hear
What happens when the healing never comes?

I know we love the seasons
Like summer and the spring
But I've been stuck in winter
Since the fall of misery
One day I'm full of anger
And the next I'm full of fear
Every year, there's a new supply of tears

But wait, tell me am I too late?

Is there a chance for me to believe
We would dance together soon
If there's a billion galaxies
I'll count each one 'til I'm with You
They say where you are is better
But I want you here with me
Oh, this is for a purpose
But hurt won't let me see

So now I must be silent
Your voice is in the wind
The hands that made the heavens
Will heal the storm within
I have so many questions
I don't know where to begin
Since you were there at the beginning
You already know the end

Ooh, what happens when the healing never comes
Do we stand and curse the heavens
Or lift our hands and feel the sun
The mystery's not clear
Just once, your voice I'd love to hear
What happens when the healing
What happens when the healing
What happens when the healing never comes
