(Chattering)
Girl, what's up?

Rock Mafia, ok
Rock Mafia, ok

Everybody likes a fiesta
Everbody wants to have fun
Bring a couple of friends and I'll betcha
They'll be hookin' up with someone

'Cause I'm tired of all the boys
Who don't like to dance
And if you don't like to dance
You don't stand a chance

So why you standing in the corner
With your arms all folded
When you know that she's ready to dance
Right up on ya'

You got the money, money
She's got the hottie body
We wanna party, party
Hook it all up (hook it up)
You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ saying
Hook it on up (hook it up)

Hook it up, baby
Hook it up

If you think you can just stand around you're dreaming
It's gonna take a little bit more
To have a chance with me is a good reason
To mix it up out on the dance floor

So, hell no, we don't dance
'Less we don't stand a chance
Then we pull up our pants
And hit the dance floor, baby, so

If you want a chance, better
Get up and dance 'less ya
Can't really dance in that case
Stay at home, playas only

You got the money, money
She's got the hottie body
We wanna party, party
Hook it all up (hook it up)
You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ saying
Hook it on up (hook it up)

Beat is dropping...
There's no stopping...
What could happen here tonight

I'll Hook you up with my friends
I'll hook you up with her friend
No one's gonna feel alone tonight

You got the money, money
She's got the hottie body (hook it up)
We wanna party, party (hook it up)
Hook it all up (hook it up)
You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ saying
Hook it on up (hook it up)

You got the money, money
She's got the hottie body (hook it up)
We wanna party, party (hook it up)
Hook it all up (hook it up)
You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ saying
Hook it on up
