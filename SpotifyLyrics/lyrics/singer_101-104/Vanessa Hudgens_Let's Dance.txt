Dance!

It's so hot
I can't stop
The music fills the room
Vibrations
Sensations
That beat goes boom, boom, boom

I've got to keep it together
I've got to keep it together
I've got to keep it together
Watch the crazy people dance

Let's dance
Show me (show me)
Hold me (hold me)
Control me (yeah)
Let's dance
Take me (take me)
Shake me (shake me)
Make me (make me)

Just like that
Don't hold back
Get crazy on the floor
We'll have fun
All day long
And then we'll still want more

I've got to keep it together (together)
I've got to keep it together (together)
I've got to keep it together
Watch the crazy people dance

Let's dance (let's dance)
Show me (show me)
Hold me (hold me)
Control me (yeah)
Let's dance (let's dance)
Take me (take me)
Shake me (shake me)

Let's dance (tonight)
Show me (feels so right)
Hold me (hold me tight)
Control me
Let's dance (right now)
Take me (spin me round)
Shake me (shake me down)
Make me

Look in my eyes
You'll realize
We can't deny
I'm into you
And you're so into me
I know you can't fight what is left to be

Let's dance
Yeah!

Hold me

Let's dance (tonight)
Show me (feels so right)
