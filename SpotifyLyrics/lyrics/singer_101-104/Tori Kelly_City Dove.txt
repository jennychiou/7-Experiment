Don't know what it's all about
But every time I look around
All I see is how we're holdin' on
Don't ask me what's wrong or right
I don't even know the time
All I know is I'm holdin' on

I haven't figured anything out
I haven't figured anything anything anything out

City dove, fly between the buildings and fences
Soft inside but rough on the edges
Waiting here for something to come just holdin' on
Ooh,
City dove, fly between the stars and the headlights
Passin' by the clouds and the street signs
Knowing that there's something to come, just holdin' on

I don't really know my fate
I just know I'm on my way
There will be mistakes movin' on
Try to get to the heart of it
Fly low but lookin' for Heaven
I know, I know I'm holding on

Won't figure everything out
Never figure everything everything everything out

City dove, fly between the buildings and fences
Soft inside but rough on the edges
Waiting here for something to come just holdin' on
Ooh,
City dove, fly between the stars and the headlights
Passin' by the clouds and the street signs
Knowing that there's something to come, just holdin' on
Ooh, ooh yeah, ooh, knowing that there's something to come, just holdin' on ooon...
Fly between the stars and the headlights
Passin' by the clouds and the street signs
Knowing that there's something to come, just holdin' on, ooonnnn...
