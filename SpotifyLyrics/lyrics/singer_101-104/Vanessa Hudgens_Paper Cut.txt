It's not the feeling like when you touch a flame
It's not like when someone calls you a bad name
It's not like the hurt when you slip and fall down
No it's not like any of these what I found is

Your love hurts like a paper cut so sweet
Never even feel it slices so deep
It seems so harmless but only at first
Like a paper cut the pain grows worse

It's not so much in the words that you don't say
It's not when you act in a distant cold way
It's more in your eyes how you look at me
Like you no longer care for what I see

Your love hurts like a paper cut so sweet
Never even feel it slices so deep
It seems so harmless but only at first
Like a paper cut the pain grows worse

You had to go and show me just how
Good your love could be then you
Threw it all away now I can't help but feel a
Brand new pain so I'm asking baby
Please stay

Your love hurts like a paper cut so sweet
Never even feel it slices so deep
It seems so harmless but only at first
Like a paper cut the pain grows worse
