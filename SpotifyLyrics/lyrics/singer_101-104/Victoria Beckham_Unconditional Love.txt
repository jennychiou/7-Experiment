You could give me diamonds
You could give me pearls
Give me all the fast cars
In the World
But there is only one thing
And its bigger than the sea
The only thing that matters
Is what you've given me

When I see the bright lights in your eyes
Feel like a bird that's just learned to fly
From now until the end of time
I'm glad you came into my life
My gift sent from above
Unconditional love

You take me as I am
Not who I'm dressed up to be
Looking at you tells me
The best things in life are free
You're the blessing that I treasure
With a heart so true
No one ever touched me
The way that you do

With your innocence you opened up my heart
I knew that I would love you right from the very start
You turned my life around showed me a better way
Thoughts of you will always make me have a brighter day
When I'm by your side it helps to see me through
Can't express all the happiness when I'm with you
A gift from up above the one I'm dreaming of
I'll always cherish you my unconditional love

When I see the bright lights in your eyes
Feel like a bird that's just learned to fly
From now until the end of time
I'm glad you came into my life
