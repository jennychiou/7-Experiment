I can make you blush
I can make you sweat
Make you come over all possessive
Like I'm your angel to protect
Make your heart beat at 134 beats a minute
Think your life's empty without me in it
But what you don't know won't hurt you
So I keep it to myself that I'm crazy about you

"Treat them mean to keep them keen"
An expression a hard lesson that I had to learn
'Cause when I give my heart too easily
That's when I get burned

I know what buttons to push to turn a man on
Doesn't mean I'm gonna push 'em with you that would be wrong
Ganna strip away my make up what you get is what you see
No trix, no games just me

I can make you beg
Make you lose your breath
I can get you feelin' all embarrassed
Like you're standin' there undressed
When I turn it on I can be magnetic
Then make you think that you're not gonna get it
Pull your strings make you do anythin'
With you never knowing that I'm crazy about you


Behind the smoke and mirrors there's a girl you never see
No trix, no games, no illusions, no fantasy
An' I want you to know her 'cause she's the real me
No trix, no games that's the way it's got to be
