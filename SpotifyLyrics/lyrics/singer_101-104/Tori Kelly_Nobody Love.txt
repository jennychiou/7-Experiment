(Why, why)

Everybody's looking for that something
No one ever wants to pay the price
Everyone is scared of going nowhere
But we ain't going anywhere tonight

I should be more cynical and tell myself that's not okay
(To feel this good when I'm with you)
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Whoa, whoa, whoa 'cause

Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-ooh-ooh-ooh do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-ooh-ooh-ooh do

Everybody's talking 'bout the next thing
Feel like what they got ain't good enough
But all I wanna do is release the tension
Bring the conversation back to us
I should be more cynical and tell myself that's not okay
(To feel this good when I'm with you)
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Whoa, whoa, whoa 'cause

Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-ooh-ooh-ooh do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-ooh-ooh-ooh do

Can we stop all the yelling baby hear me out
I want you here and now
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Hey, hey, hey...
Yeah, all right, everybody's looking for that new thing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody love
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-ooh-ooh-ooh do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-ooh-ooh-ooh do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-ooh-ooh-ooh do
