What you think about this?
I been holding it in now I'm letting it flow
What you think about this?
I'm gonna do my own thing yeah I'm flying solo so
Don't tell me how it's gonna be
On my own
And the thing of it is
There's nothing round here that I'm gonna miss
'Cause you're holding me down
I just wanna fly
There comes a time when I gotta say goodbye
To the life that you see me in
Here's where I begin

And I promise myself
I ain't nobody's, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself
Even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain
Never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself
I'm the only one who will believe me

There's a voice in my head
Telling me come on, come on, move on
There's a voice in my head
Telling me I know my right from wrong
They say what doesn't kill you can
Make you strong
Now I know what it means
You can try to bend but you ain't breakin my dreams
I'll be making mistakes
Comin' up at a loss
I'll be tumbling down
But Like MC shake it off
I'll stay cool 'cause I know who's boss
Of me, myself, and I

And I promise myself
I ain't nobody's, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself
Even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain
Never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself
I'm the only one who will believe me

I'll keep movin even when the beat is gone (I will)
I'll keep doin' what I got to do to carry on (I will)
So don't hold me down 'cause I'm gonna fly
And the time has come and gotta say goodbye
To the life that you see me in
Here's where I begin

And I promise myself
I ain't nobody's, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself
Even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain
Never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself
I'm the only one who will believe me
