(Da da dada dada daada dada...)
It takes a girl to understand
Just how to win
She knows... She can
I think it's clear
Who wears the pants
What boy... could stand... a chance

(Vamp)
She makes it look easy
In control completely
She'll get the best of you... every single... time
Thought by now you'd realize you should

Never underestimate a girl
Gets anything she wants
She's never gonna stop
(You know it... we know it)
Never underestimate a girl
She's always gotta plan
The world is in her hands

She got the lipstick
Puts it together
Boys have it good
But girls have it better...(that's right)
Your secretary might
End up your boss
Whatever you... really like it... or not

(Vamp)
She makes it look easy
In control completely
She'll get the best of you... every single... time
That's right... no no no you should

Never underestimate a girl
Gets anything she wants
She's never gonna stop
(You know it... we know it)
Never underestimate a girl
She's always gotta plan
The world is in her hands

She might be president
Make all the rules
Don't try to win the game
You're only gonna lose
Now girls you know we got it
Got it goin' on
We've been tryin' to tell them all along
Listen up guys
Take a li'l sound advice
(Da da dada dada daada dada...)

Never underestimate a girl
Gets anything she wants
She's never gonna stop
(You know it... we know it)
Never underestimate a girl
She's always gotta plan
