Oh yeah
Yeah yeah

Phone rings at a quarter to nine
Some crazy girl is on the line
Talkin' bout how I better recognise
Found my phone number in his Calvin Klein's, and I'm like
What's that gotta do with me?
Your man is the one who needs questioning
'Cause there ain't nothing that you're gonna achieve
By calling me and giving me the third degree

And if he's your man then tell me
Why was he sweatin' me?
All up in the club last night
Telling me I'm the type of girl he likes
But you say you don't believe (don't believe)
He was acting that way
Girl I wish you could have seen
How your man was shakin' me

Girlfriend
Let me give you somethin'
I know that you love him
But you should have saw him last night
You ain't his girlfriend
Anymore than I am
I know you see him
But girl you really should have saw him last night

Oh no, no you didn't say
That I need to back away
I thought you heard when I told you that
It ain't my fault if he wants you back, no
All that's been said to me
It don't really mean a thing
You need to realise that I'm not the one
You should call with an attitude

And if he's your man then tell me (tell me)
Why was he freakin' with me? (freak with me)
All up on the floor last night
Saying things I know you wouldn't like
But you say you don't believe (can't believe)
He was acting that way
Girl I wish you could haveve seen
How your man was shakin' me
Ohooh

Girlfriend
Let me give you somethin' (oh oh oh)
I know that you love him
But you should have saw him last night (oh yeah, last night, girl)
You ain't his girlfriend
Anymore than I am (anymore)
I know you see him
But girl you really should have saw him last night

Oh oh

Did you really think your man was down for you?
Did you really think that his love was true?
If you had been loving your man right
He wouldn't have been puttin' it on me all night
You weren't his girl last night
Girlfriend, girfriend
Baby

Girlfriend
Let me give you somethin' (let me give you)
I know that you love him (I know that you love him yeah)
But you should have saw him last night
You ain't his girlfriend (girlfriend yeah)
Anymore than I am
I know you see him (oh oh)
But girl you really should have saw him last night


Girl I really wish you saw him

Girlfriend
I know that you love him
But but you should've saw him last
Saw him last night-ght-ght
Anymore than I...
Girlfriend-friend
I know you see him
Girlfriend saw him (saw him)
Saw him last
Saw him last night-ight girlfriend

(Laughter)

(Giiiirl... friend)
Girlfriend
Let me give you somethin'
I know that you love him (I know that you love him)
But you should have saw him last night (saw your guy last night)
You ain't his girlfriend (last night)
Anymore than I am
I know you see him
But girl you really should have saw him last night
