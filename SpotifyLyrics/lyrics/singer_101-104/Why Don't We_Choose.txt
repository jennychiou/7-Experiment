We're supposed to be together, you ain't thinkin' straight
I gotta place that we can go and ease your stress away
A couple times I came around and you was M.I.A
It's kinda hard to be in love when we're in different states

Feel some type of way
I ain't tryna play
You got options, I got options
But you're here with me
Spend some time away
Now I'm here to stay
Life ain't stoppin', girl, what's poppin'?
What's it gonna be?

Choose, I'm just sayin', what you wanna do?
Choose, I just dropped down in your city to
Choose, let me put you onto something new
Choose, ain't no tellin' what we get into

I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose (choose)
I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose

So what, you stayin' or comin'?
It shouldn't be a discussion
All of these girls, we runnin' around
And I still be craving your love
Center stage, no bluffin'
Interstate we buzzin'
Touchdown, now takin' off
So what, you all or nothing?

Feel some type of way
I ain't tryna play
You got options, I got options
But you're here with me
Spend some time away
Now I'm here to stay
Life ain't stoppin', girl, what's poppin'?
What's it gonna be?

Choose, I'm just sayin', what you wanna do?
Choose, I just dropped down in your city to
Choose, let me put you onto something new
Choose, ain't no tellin' what we get into

I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose
I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose

'Cause you got it, I want it, no time to waste
I got what you want so come here to me
'Cause you got it, I want it, no time to waste
I got what you want so come here to me

Choose, I'm just sayin', what you wanna do?
Choose, I just dropped down in your city to
Choose, let me put you onto something new
Choose, ain't no tellin' what we get into

I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose
I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose

I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose
I'm ju-, I'm ju-, I'm just sayin', choose
Choose, choose, choose, choose
Choose, choose, choose, choose
