He sends a friend to ask me if I'm interested
I see you coming my way with a smile
You say, "He's the guy, you caught his eye
But he's afraid to come over, he's a little shy
So why don't you come talk for a while?"

But I see your smile, baby
The messenger may take the prize
And you see the look in my eyes

I'd rather be with you, baby
You know what you're doing to me
Yeah, you're the one, the only one
That sets it all on fire

Yeah, you, baby
And I can see you wanna be with me
And now you know what I'm saying is true
I'd rather be with you

It's you and me but then you call him over
And your buddy makes three
I know you're just trying to do right
A glance, a touch
Try and not to stare just a little too much
Baby, it's impossible to fight

Best of intentions
Do you really wanna give me away?
I'll take this moment to say

I'd rather be with you, baby
You know what you're doing to me
Yeah, you're the one, the only one
That sets it all on fire

Yeah, you, baby
And I can see you wanna be with me
And now you know what I'm saying is true
I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you

It's only time, I'll make you mine
You know you can't deny me
Come a little closer, baby and tell your friend
That I'm not really interested
There is nothing more that you can do

I'd rather be with you, baby
You know what you're doing to me
Yeah, you're the one, the only one
That sets it all on fire

Yeah, you, baby
And I can see you wanna be with me
And yeah, you know what I'm saying is true
Yeah, you know what I'm saying is true
Yeah, you know what I'm saying is true
I'd rather be with you

Yeah, yeah, oh, I'd rather be, rather be
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, I'd rather be with you
And now you know what I'm saying is true
I'd rather be with you
