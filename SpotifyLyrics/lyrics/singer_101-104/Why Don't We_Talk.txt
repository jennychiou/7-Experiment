It's not just me, no, you feel it too
You know and I know, we lost the lotto
It's like our love cut the line in two
We're on different sides though, lost in the echo

Our lips are moving, they're makin' words
Words turn to riddles, we make it worse
'Cause I'm not listening, and you're not listening, no
We try to fix it, it never works

We go, breaking up like cell phones
When I speak, 'cause you don't listen when I talk
Dial tone, nothing but that high note
When you speak, 'cause I don't listen when you talk

Ooh, yeah, don't think we'll ever get better, better
Gets worse with every letter, letter
Dial tone, nothing but that high note
On repeat, 'cause we don't listen when we talk

If we could speak like we're trying to
Share conversation, communication
I'm hearing me and you're hearing you
We're on different islands, just sounds of silence

Our lips are moving, they're makin' words (oh)
Words turn to riddles, don't make it worse
'Cause I'm not listening, (I'm not listening)
And you're not listening, (and you're not listening) no
We try to fix it, it never works, (hey!)

We go, breaking up like cell phones
When I speak, 'cause you don't listen when I talk
Dial tone, nothing but that high note
When you speak, 'cause I don't listen when you talk

Ooh, yeah, don't think we'll ever get better, better (hey)
Gets worse with every letter, letter
Dial tone, nothing but that high note
On repeat, 'cause we don't listen when we talk (listen when we talk, ay ay ay)

Our lips are moving, they're making words (don't make it worse)
Words turn to riddles, we make it worse
'Cause I'm not listening, (not listening)
And you're not listening (and you're not listening), no
We try to fix it, it never works (oh)

We go, breaking up like cell phones
When I speak, 'cause you don't listen when I talk
Dial tone, nothing but that high note
When you speak, 'cause I don't listen when you talk

Listen when we talk, oh yeah
Don't think we'll ever get better, better (don't think we'll ever get better, no)
Gets worse with every letter, letter (worse with every letter)
Dial tone, nothing but that high note (nothing but that high note)
On repeat, 'cause we don't listen when we talk (don't listen when we talk)

Talk
