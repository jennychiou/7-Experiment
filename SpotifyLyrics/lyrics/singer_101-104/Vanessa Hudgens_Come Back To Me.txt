Y'all need to get ready to hear
The unbelievable, indescribable
Vanessa Hudgens
Baby V

(Baby come back)

Everyday I try to play another game
But my heart can't take it
I try to find another boy
But all the while I can't face it

Why do I miss you so much?
I wanna stop this hurt inside
Oh baby please
Give us one more try

I see you out with all your friends
Laughing it up as you pretend
To have a good time
I know 'cause I'm living the same life

So one of us has got to say
We can't keep living this same way
So I'll be the one
Yeah I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again

Baby come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes

Baby come back to me
I should've never set you free
My baby
Come back

I wanna call, but then I stall
'Cause after all, I just couldn't take it
'Cause if your play was to push me away
You know the day, my heart, you'd break it

I know I made a mistake
Can't you stop your foolish pride?
And come back to me
Let's try, let's try, let's try, let's try it again

Baby come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes

Baby come back to me
I should've never set you free
My baby
Come back

You know you miss your Baby V
And I can see that you think about me
So why do you act like you don't care?
Like all this love between us isn't there?

I know that you're upset
I know I did you wrong
I know that you want me to pay for all the pain I've caused
But in the end it all comes down to just one thing
It's you and me
So I'll sing

(Baby come back)

Baby come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes

Baby come back to me
I should've never set you free
My baby
Come back

Baby come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes

Baby come back to me
I should've never set you free
My baby
Come back

(Baby come back)
