You never hear me singin' love songs
Wasn't big on poetry
Never cried in the movies
Didn't wanna feel so weak
I would never talk about it
Never let it get too deep
But something in me's changin'
Guess you did something to me

'Cause for the first time I get worried
When I'm lookin' in your eyes
That one day you might leave me
And it keeps me up at night
I guess that means I really love you
'Cause I'm afraid to make mistakes
If you ever left me that would be my first heartbreak
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
If you ever left me that would be my first heartbreak

Maybe I shouldn't be thinkin' so far ahead
Better just enjoy this moment
And be happy for what I get
But you know it's not that easy
To get out of my head
So I guess that it's a good thing
When you want something so bad

'Cause for the first time I get worried
When I'm lookin' in your eyes
That one day you might leave me
And it keeps me up at night
I guess that means I really love you
'Cause I'm afraid to make mistakes
If you ever left me that would be my first heartbreak

I wanna run I wanna stay
Hold every piece so it won't break
Wanna let go, wanna hold tight
Afraid that I might suffocate, you with my love
How much is enough?
How much is too safe?

'Cause for the first time I get worried
When I'm lookin' in your eyes
That one day you might leave me
And it keeps me up at night
I guess that means I really love you
'Cause I'm afraid to make mistakes
If you ever left me that would be my first heartbreak
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
If you ever left me that would be my first heartbreak
