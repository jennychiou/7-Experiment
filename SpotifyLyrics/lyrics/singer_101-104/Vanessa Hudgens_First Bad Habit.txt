Turn it off, turn it on let the vibrate on your phone
Call me up, wanna talk then you freeze me
There's a saying when you're gone
Keep me guessin' what you want
But my heart says it's you who can please me

I get pushed to extremes and I should know what it means
But I can't get let game to be over
When your mood's never change
Only got myself to blame 'cause I fall for it over and over

You're like my first bad habit I can't live without it
I can't give you up, give you up
And even though you're trouble I commit for double
I can't say enough is enough

I'm a part of you, you're a part of me
And I know it's wrong but I can't get free
You're like my first bad habit
How am I gonna give you up

You're the worst, you're the best
Something different from the rest
It's a fact seeing you is never easy
Love my style, hate my friends
Though the conflict never end
How much worse can it get when you tease me

Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know, wanna know
The way we go around
Can't put my first bad habit down

Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know, wanna know
The way we go around
I just can't give you up

You're like my first bad habit I can't live without it
I can't give you up, give you up
And even though you're trouble I commit for double
I can't say enough is enough

I'm a part of you, you're a part of me
And I know it's wrong but I can't get free
You're like my first bad habit
How am I gonna give you up

Turn it off, turn it on, off, off, on, on
Keep guessing what you want
Guessing, guessing what you want
Turn it off, turn it on, off, off, on, on
Keep guessing what you want
Guessing, guessing what you want

You're like my first bad habit I can't live without it
I can't give you up, give you up
And even though you're trouble I commit for double
I can't say enough is enough

I'm a part of you, you're a part of me
And I know it's wrong but I can't get free
You're like my first bad habit
How am I gonna give you up
