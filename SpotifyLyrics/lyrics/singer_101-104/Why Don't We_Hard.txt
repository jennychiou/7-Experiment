It's hard to act like I don't think about you sometimes
I should win an Oscar

It was my birthday, right at the end of the night
It was that first time, he hurt you bad and you cried
Right in my arms, fell to a million pieces
Held you together, girl, I know all your secrets

Do you know what is to, be the one to fix you?
And all you do is run back to the one who breaks your heart
You're makin' this too hard

I know I said I'll be your friend, but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard
I said I'll be there to the end but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard
You keep runnin' back to him, I know it's hard
Hard, it's just too hard
I know I said I'll be your friend, but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard

It's hard to sing along to songs
That people sing when they're happy
I should win a Grammy

You block his number, and then you call me instead
You give him distance, and then you sleep in my bed
You say you miss him, and you go crawlin' back
That's my mission, it's to be here when you're sad

Do you know what is to, be the one to fix you?
And all you do is run back to the one who breaks your heart
You're makin' this too hard

I know I said I'll be your friend, but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard
I said I'll be there to the end but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard
You keep runnin' back to him, I know it's hard
Hard, it's just too hard
I know I said I'll be your friend, but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard

All this daytime drama makes me feel so alive
So good at fakin', I should win an Emmy

I know I said I'll be your friend, but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard
I said I'll be there to the end but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard
You keep runnin' back to him, I know it's hard
Hard, it's just too hard
I know I said I'll be your friend, but it's too hard
Hard, it's just too hard

Hard, it's just too hard
Hard, it's just too hard
