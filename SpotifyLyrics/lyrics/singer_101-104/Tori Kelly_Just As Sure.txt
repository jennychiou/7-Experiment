Just as sure as the sun
Sets at the end of the day
Then the darkness fades
And the clouds, they roll away
Just as sure as the hands
On the clock keep ticking away the time
And trouble on my mind
Makes it hard for joy to find

Just as sure as winter fades
And then it turns to spring
I believe deliverance, will surely come for me
Just as sure as my heart
Will someday be made anew
I know you love me
Just as I do love You
Mmm, just as I do love You

Just as sure as the test
Is there to make me perfect in your eyes
It may hurt for a while
But by faith I shall survive
Just as sure as the rain
Falls on me only to make me grow
No matter how I feel
Now I live by what I know

Mmm, just as sure as trials come
To pull me close to You
In your presence now I see
A God I never knew (A God I never knew)
Just as sure as a touch
From your hand can turn grey skies to shades of blue
I know you love me
Just as I do love You
Just as I do love you (Ooh)

I love you and I trust You
'Cause you know what's best for me
And even though the crowd sometimes gets loud
And it's hard to hear you speak (Hear you speak)
Just as sure as your grace
Is faithful even when my faith I lose
I know you love me (I know you love me)
Just as I do love You

I love you and I trust You
'Cause you know what's best for me
Even though the crowd sometimes gets loud
And it's hard to hear you speak, ooh
Just as sure as your grace
Is faithful even when my faith I lose
I know you love me
Just as I do love You
Just as I do love You

I do love You, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love you ('Cause you first loved me)
(Jesus I love You)
The nights that I cried (you loved me)
When I should've died (you loved me)
And that's the reason why (I do love You)
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever
(I do love You)
Forever is a long time
I'm giving you all my life
Jesus, I love You
