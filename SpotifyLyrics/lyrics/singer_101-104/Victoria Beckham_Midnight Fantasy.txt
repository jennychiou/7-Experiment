Its half past twelve and I'm on my own
Putting on some music turn the lights down low
Temperature is rising and I'm in the mood
I'm feeling you what you make me do
I wonder baby do you ever think of me
Would you go for whatever comes naturally
I'm lying here I'm waiting all alone in my bed
Thinking of a way to get in to your head

I'm gonna take you places that you've never been before

I come in to your dreams make you beg for more
I'll hold on to your body I'll give you what you need
Go deeper with me baby I'm your midnight fantasy
I'm gonna take you places that you've never been before
I come in to your dreams make you beg for more
I'll hold on to your body I'll give you what you need
Go deeper with me baby I'm your midnight fantasy

Anything you wanna try I just might
I'll wake you from your sleep we'll go on all night
The things I wanna do when you look me in the eyes
You're taking me higher till the early light

Oh holding you close would be nice
But you can't be here tonight
So I'm gonna play with your mind
