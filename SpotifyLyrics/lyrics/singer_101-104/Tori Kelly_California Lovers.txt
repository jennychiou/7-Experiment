Dancing in the sand at the bonfire
We jamming out to Marley at night, uh
Staying up to watch every sunrise
Just living like we ain't gonna die, uh
Everybody said I was crazy
Yeah, everybody said you'd be gone, uh-uh
I know that I'm supposed to forget you
And boy, you know I moved on, but

Every time I'm driving with the top down, baby
I remember sneaking out in your car (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Jumped into the ocean while the sun kissed on me
Was a sucker for them boys with a wild heart

I'll be cool with it, done with it
You're never on my mind
Till I feel the heat of you and me; it hits me every summer
Remember when no one else could make me feel alive?
We were young and free, 17, just California lovers
Mmm, yeah

Teaching me to skate down the boardwalk
I'm crashing into you like a wave, uh
Even if it was only small talk
You always knew the right thing to say, uh
Maybe I was just being stupid
For thinking that my first love would last, uh-uh
Even though it ended in heartache
Sometimes I wanna go back

Every time I'm driving with the top down, baby
I remember sneaking out in your car (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Jumped into the ocean while the sun kissed on me
Was a sucker for them boys with wild hearts

I'll be cool with it, done with it
You're never on my mind
Till I feel the heat of you and me; it hits me every summer
Remember when no one else could make me feel alive? (yeah)
We were young and free (young and free), 17 (17), just California lovers

Reminiscin', what a vision
Lips kissing, seats christened
Bob Marley twisting, top down, Pacific Highway
Black Sinatra remix, I did it my way
Your legs deserve they own day of the week, Th-Th-Thighday
Mark your calendars, the love champ's back
I make your memories challenger, Venice in the gondola
You can have a sip of whatever you want, a bottle of
Life's a sportscar, baby, you gotta throttle 'er
We just trippin', cord flippin', for club pickin'
Clock tickin', we still kickin' it all weekend
I was your Legend, you was my Chrissy Teigen - glory!
You're the reason that summer's my favorite season

You're never on my mind
Till I feel the heat of you and me; it hits me every summer
Remember when (yeah) no one else (no one else) could make me feel alive?
We were young and free, 17 (17), just California lovers
Cool with it, done with it
You're never on my mind
Till I feel the heat of you and me; it hits me every summer
Remember when no one else could make me feel alive?
We were young and free, 17, just California lovers

(Lovers)
Yeah
(Make me feel alive, make me feel alive, make me feel alive)
California lovers
(California lovers)
