Ooh (you got-, you got-, you got-, you)

You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ay
Damn, I'm hooked (oh)

You were there when I was low, you held me high
And baby when you take control, we can go all night
Every single place we go, you start a fight
But then you kiss my neck and take a bite

Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me, me, me

You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ay
Damn, I'm hooked

Ooh, I'm hooked
Ooh, I'm hooked (brrr- ah, pa, pa)

Ooh, I know that I shouldn't touch but you twist my heart
'Cause I can never get enough once the feeling starts
Baby, I'm the gasoline and your kiss is the spark
But then you take the wheel and crash my car

Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me, me, me

You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ay
Damn, I'm hooked

Ooh, I'm hooked
Ooh, I'm hooked

You got me under your influence
I swear I'm never gonna give you up, up, up, up, up, up, up

You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good
You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ay
Damn, I'm hooked

Ooh, I'm hooked
Ooh, I'm hooked, oh
