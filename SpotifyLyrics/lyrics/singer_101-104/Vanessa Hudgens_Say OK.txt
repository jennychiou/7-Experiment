You are fine, you are sweet
Fine, I'm still a bit naive with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak and I feel sparks

But I don't wanna be into you
If you're not looking for true love
No, I don't wanna start seeing you
If I can't be your only one, so tell me

When it's not alright, when it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? Will you say okay?
Will you stick with me through whatever
Or run away?

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay

When you call I don't know
If I should pick up the phone every time
I'm not like all my friends
Who keep calling up the boys, I'm so shy

But I don't wanna be into you
If you don't treat me the right way
See, I can only start seeing you
If you can make my heart feel safe
Feel safe!

When it's not alright, when it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? Will you say okay?
Will you stick with me through whatever
Or run away?

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away, don't run away

Let me know if it's gon' be you
Boy, you got some things to prove
Let me know that you'll keep me safe
I don't want you to run away

So let me know that you'll call on time
Let me know that you'll help me shine
Will you wipe my tears away?
Will you hold me closer?

When it's not alright, when it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better
Will you say alright? Will you say okay?
Will you stick with me through whatever
Or run away?

Say that it's gon' be alright
That it's gon' be okay
Don't run away

Say that it's gon' be alright
That it's gon' be okay, don't run away
Will you say okay?

Say that it's gon' be alright
That it's gon' be okay, don't run away
Will you say okay?
