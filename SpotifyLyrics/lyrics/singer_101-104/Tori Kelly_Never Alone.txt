In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
And I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes

I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, he calls me his own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In your light I now understand
That everything I have and everything that I am
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine

I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, he calls me his own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

I may have took some time
But now I realise
My imperfections were a part of your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken world'll be beautiful

There's not a hole too deep
Where God's love is not deeper still
You've come too far to give up now
Let's go!

I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, he calls me his own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
