I was not waiting for your love before
It was out on this shore doubt laid
I never really get this feeling in my chest

It's a new day to discover
So many things to uncover
Even when the tide is high
Out here it's just you and I
Perfect how we fit together
Being around you is a pleasure
Like the way gold lasts forever
I feel like I found my treasure

When I first fell into those deep blues in your eyes
I thought I would be fine 'cause
I never really get this feeling in my chest

It's a new day to discover
So many things to uncover
Even when the tide is high
Out here it's just you and I
Perfect how we fit together
Being around you is a pleasure
Like the way gold lasts forever
I feel like I found my treasure

I wasn't even looking for you
My skies were already blue
Now you what I hold on to
These eyes are fixed on you
When did love come into play
I could never turn away now

It's a new day to discover
So many things to uncover
Even when the tide is high
Out here it's just you and I
Perfect how we fit together
Being around you is a pleasure
Like the way gold lasts forever
I feel like I found my treasure

Like the way gold lasts forever
I feel like I found my treasure

Like the way gold lasts forever
I feel like I found my treasure
