I know what you're tryin' to do
Know what you're tryin' to say
You're giving me the eye
Then pusin' me away

It's like you're playing games
Like you're the only one
We're both one and the same
So think about it

All you're friends are tellin' me
There's only one ambition on your mind
You keep on denyin' it
But all the proof I need is in your eyes

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

You keep askin' how I am
And watchin' what I do
You're waitin' for the chance
Come on and tell the truth

It's more than obvious
The way you cover up
So tell me why the fuss
Just come on over

All you're friends are tellin' me
There's only one ambition on your mind
You keep on denyin' it
But all the proof I need is in your eyes
It's in your eyes

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

I got a confession, I got
I got a confession, I got
I got a confession, I got
I got a confession, I got
I got a confession, I got
I got a confession, I got

I got, I got, I-I-I got a confession
I can see through what you're doin'
Had it right from the beginnin'
That you're identified

Come on over to me
Tell me now before you lose me
It's no secret you pursue me
That you're identified

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

I can put up a front
But I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart
