Close your eyes, baby count to three, and tell me now,
Did you think of him, like it used to be, it ain't no surprise,
'Cause he's out of love, and he's out of luck, getting lazy now,
With that attitude, I've had enough, and it won't be the first time,

Remember the lies you denied 'cause you said so, yeah what got into you?
Remember the love you discovered that he'd shown, Mmm what's he trying to prove?
Remember the pay every day that he let go, look what he's done to you,
And he still he wanted you to run around him girl.

No is shouldn't be like that, not fooling me,
Damn his lovin' damn his lies, they're buggin' me,
No it shouldn't be like that, he's trying to be,
Trippin' out like all the guys, why can't you see?

It's 3am, and he still ain't home, out with his friends,
Guess you could have thought, guess you should have known, that he ain't coming back,
Girl he's out of line, and he's out of time, 'cause I'm telling you,
Gotta take him on, and show your mind, and it won't be the last time.

So put away your money, she don't wanna know,
It's too late to say your sorry, she don't wanna know
She's leaving don't you worry, boy let it go,
Had your chance make no advance to take it, and I told you so.

Girl I'm saying, that his love and his lies, keep you waiting
Now he's paying, 'cause you're no longer his for the taking
