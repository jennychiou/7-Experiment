I saw you outside getting out your ride
A CLK430 you got style
As soon as I checked you out a ladies man no doubt
From head to toe your all style and I like it
How 'bout you buy me a rose 'cause I think
This is gonna get a little interesting
Lets see where this conversation goes I'm not sure that I want you to know

I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it

If you take me home get me all alone
Nothing could happen it's just too soon
I'm just being upfront telling you from the jump
Not tonight I'm not that type of girl I'm sorry
If I gave you the wrong impression I apologise from the bottom of my heart
If talking out my head probably misled you
I'm confused and I'm a little scared

I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it
I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it

My mind its playing tricks on me I'm just not thinking clearly
This has happened too quickly I've got to slow down
Tomorrow is another day this I'll promise if you say
That it doesn't matter everything is gonna be ok

I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it
I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it
I wish I could right now wish that I could show you how I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide how badly I want you tonight I've gotta fight it
