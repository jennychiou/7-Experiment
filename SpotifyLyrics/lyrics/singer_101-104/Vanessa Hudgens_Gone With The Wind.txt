I used to think being like you
Was the key to having everything
Every dream come true
I used to think following the crowd
Was the only thing that I could do
Until I found out

I'm ok (dig it)
Sometimes you gotta do your own thing (dig it)
Every winter turns to spring (get it)
And everybody's got their own wings

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standing my ground
And who I am and for that I'm proud
And the girl that you knew
Well she's gone with the wind
She's gone gone
Well she's gone gone
She's gone gone
Well she's gone with the wind

I'm speaking up
My conscience is clear
And I don't care what anybody thinks
I've released that fear
And I don't have to be
What you want me to be
'Cause every time I try to fit in
It feels like I'm in prison

I'm ok (dig it)
Sometimes you gotta do your own thing (dig it)
Every winter turns to spring (get it)
And everybody's got their own wings

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standing my ground
And who I am and for that I'm proud
And the girl that I was
Well she's gone with the wind
She's gone gone
Well she's gone gone
She's gone gone
Well she's gone with the wind

One look in my eyes
And you'll see I'm different
I am finding myself everyday
And along the way I have changed

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standing my ground
And who I am and for that I'm proud
And the girl that you knew
Well she's gone with the wind
She's gone gone
Well she's gone gone
She's gone gone
Well she's gone with the wind
