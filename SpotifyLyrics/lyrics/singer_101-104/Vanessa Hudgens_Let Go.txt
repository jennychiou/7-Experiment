Let go
All I wanna do tonight

The days are long, I just got home, and work is driving me crazy
I could do up, I could go out
But I'm feelin' too lazy
I wanna run, I wanna have fun
But I don't want to work it
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight

All I wanna do is let go tonight, feelin' right
Just want to forget about it
All I want to do is let go tonight, wind it up without my get-up
All I wanna do is get down tonight, move around tonight
Don't really care about it
All I want to do is let go tonight, I'm feelin' free tonight
It's just for me

I count on you you're comin' too
Yeah I'm hopin you're feelin' it
'Cause I'm at my best and at my worse
Yeah, you've already seen it
Let down your hair, the hell who cares
Gonna let it all out
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight

All I wanna do is let go tonight, feelin' right
Just want to forget about it
All I want to do is let go tonight, wind it up without my get-up
All I wanna do is get down tonight, move around tonight
Don't really care about it
All I want to do is let go tonight, I'm feelin' free tonight
It's just for me

(Breakdown)
High heels just feels
Like a business dance make it hard to dance
Tight shirt, short skirt
Just hurt, too much work
A fake up, the make up
Never handled the way 'cause I want to sweat
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight

All I wanna do is let go tonight, feelin' right
Just want to forget about it
All I want to do is let go tonight, wind it up without my get-up
All I wanna do is get down tonight, move around tonight
Don't really care about it
All I want to do is let go tonight, I'm feelin' free tonight
It's just for me

All I wanna do
All I wanna do
