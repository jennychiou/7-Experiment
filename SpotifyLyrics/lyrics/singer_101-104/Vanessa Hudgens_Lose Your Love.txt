If I should lose your love boy
Shame on me
I was just too stubborn
Too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love

I remember the moment I first looked in your eyes
And seen nothin' looking back at me
It was then I realized
That even though you were there
Your heart was long gone
An I knew right then how lost I'd be
Before you move on

Before its final, before you close the door
I am asking you, please can we try this once more
Just hold me tight, don't ever let go
And if never comes around I want you to know
I want you, I need you, can't lose you tonight
I won't do nothing to lose you
I won't lose this fight
I'm going to make it right
