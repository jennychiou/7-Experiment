Did it ever cross your mind boy?

Did it ever cross your mind boy?
Fears that I would face
Knowing that I would never see your face
I miss you baby every day and night
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind boy?
You would break my heart
Knowing that you would break this all apart
These tears of mine I cry so hard at night
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind
That I'd be left behind
Did you ever stop to think
You'd lose me in a blink
Did it ever cross your mind
I thought we said for life
Did it ever cross your mind
No, and that just ain't right

No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right

Miss you now you're gone
Beat down and tryin' so hard to move on
I'll face up now I'm lying to myself
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind boy?
I've had time to think
And all my friends are watching as I sink
Nothing no one can do to help
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind
That I'd be left behind
Did you ever stop to think
You'd lose me in a blink
Did it ever cross your mind
I thought we said for life
Did it ever cross your mind
No, and that just ain't right

No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right

Now you're gone
I'm tryin', tryin' to move on
Now you're gone
I'm tryin', tryin' to move on
Now you're gone
I'm tryin', tryin' to move on
Now you're gone
Did it ever cross your mind, baby

Did it ever cross your mind
That I'd be left behind
Did you ever stop to think
You'd lose me in a blink
Did it ever cross your mind
I thought we said for life
Did it ever cross your mind
No, and that just ain't right

No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right
