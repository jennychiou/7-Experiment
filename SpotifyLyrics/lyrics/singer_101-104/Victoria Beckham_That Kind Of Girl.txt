Boy when I first saw u - knew I could adore u
And it's my nature to be shy but not tonight

So let me make the first move - make it easy for you
Someone has to break the ice, oh Oh

Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
'Cause my affection ain't something you can buy
Got my suspicions by lookin' in your eyes
That you could be my kind of guy

Do you like watchin the sun come up
Sippin champagne in a paper cup
Laughing when you're makin' love (oh baby)
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
Dancin' to a sad love song
Even when the music's gone
Kisses that go on and on and on
'Cause I'm that kind of girl

Is this first star wishing or woman's intuition
Has my arrow found its mark? Oh! Baby
'Cause all I do is think of you in a fantasy for two
And I've just got to let you know
'Cause being real is in my heart and soul

Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
'Cause my affection ain't something you can buy
Got my suspicions by lookin' in your eyes
That you could be my kind of guy

I wanna be kissin' in the rain
Fallen in love over and over again
I want the pleasure and not the pain
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
