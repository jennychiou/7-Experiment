Let me tell ya baby
Don't need no diamonds on my body
Got no green in my eyes
(Can you feel me, yeah)
In a brand new Bentley
I'll tell you now it makes no difference
Just want all of your time

'Cause you kiss me like I'm dreamin'
Like I'm one in a million
And I think it's time your figured it out, ooh
'Cause I know I got that somethin'
And it won't cost you nothin'
I already feel expensive enough
Turn that gold into dust
That's what matters, matters
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Money don't buy love
Money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
Your money don't buy love

So call me crazy
No I'm not starin' at your pocket
I ain't diggin' for dimes
(Can you feel me, yeah)
The fact is baby
We've all been taught to chase that dollar
But that's not on my mind

'Cause you kiss me like I'm dreamin'
Like I'm one in a million
And I think it's time your figured it out, ooh
'Cause I know I got that somethin'
And it won't cost you nothin'
I already feel expensive enough
Turn that gold into dust
That's what matters, matters
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Money don't buy love
Money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love

Your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
Your money don't buy love

Heeeey yeah yeah
I feel expensive enough
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
No your money don't buy love
Your money don't buy love

'Cause you kiss me like I'm dreamin'
Like I'm one in a million
And I think it's time your figured it out, ooh
'Cause I know I got that somethin'
And it won't cost you nothin'
I already feel expensive enough
Turn that gold into dust
That's what matters, matters
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Money don't buy love
