I need your love, need your love

Taste in your tongue, the smoke in your lungs
And I need your love, and I need your love
The salt on your skin is pulling me in
And I need your love, and I need your love

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes
This time

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste tonight
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste tonight

The scratch in your voice leaves me no choice
And I won't give up, and I can't give up

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes
This time

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste tonight
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste tonight

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes

This time
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste tonight (I don't wanna waste tonight)
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it
Don't wanna waste tonight
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
