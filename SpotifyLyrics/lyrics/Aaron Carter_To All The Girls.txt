I remember sunny days
Chillin' on the beach
And catchin' rays
Shell toed shoes the girls would wear
Pink bikinis everywhere
Listenin' to CDs after dark
Outkast blastin' Rosa Parks
There's so much that we've been through
There's still so much more to do

Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you and it's like that

To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls you're where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me

To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls who've held it down for me
To all the girls who gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me

(Being good to me)
I wanna thank you for being good to me

Sometimes I sit and reminisce
Of all the hot girls that I miss
Tank tops with the low-cut jeans
All the guys know what I mean
Hip-hop style to retro rock
All the girls that's on my block
You've been down with me since one
And we've only just begun

Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you and it's like that

To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls you're where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me

To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls who've held it down for me
To all the girls who gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me

(Being good to me)
I wanna thank you for being good to me

Come on
Jump Jump (2x)

So let me hit you with one more
Baby I'll see you out on tour
And we can do it all again
Until then...(woo)

To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls who held it down for me
To all the girls who gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me (2x)
