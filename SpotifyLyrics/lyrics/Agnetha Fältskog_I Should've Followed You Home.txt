Can't believe it's really you
You still look the way you used to
All this time, what have you done?
Won't you tell me, what you've been through?

And maybe if you want to
Let's talk for a while

Dance floor dust
Never quite settles
Busy feet remember still
The way we moved so close in the darkness,
All the music, the magic, the thrill
I must have been so lost in the moment
I missed the chance to make you my own
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know

I should've followed you home
Yeah, should've followed you home

So familiar and so right
You never left me since that one night
Though we try to say goodbye
Some things stay with you your whole life
For your whole life

Dance floor dust
Never quite settles
Busy feet remember still
The way we moved so close in the darkness,
All the music, the magic, the thrill
I must have been so lost in the moment
I missed the chance to make you my own
Now I know
Now I know
I should've followed you home

Snow falls,
Street lights paint your face
Smile and say "take care"
I'll see you soon again

Maybe if you want to
I'll see you soon again

Dance floor dust
Never quite settles
Busy feet remember still
The way we moved so close in the darkness,
All the music, the magic, the thrill
I must have been so lost in the moment
I missed the chance to make you my own
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know

I should've followed you home
Yeah, should've followed you home
Oh, should've followed you home
Yeah
Yeah, should've followed you home
Yeah
Yeah
Ooh, followed you home.
