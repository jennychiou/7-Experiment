I need your love to light up this house
I wanna know what you're all about
I wanna feel you, feel you tonight
I wanna tell you that it's alright

I need your love to guide me back home
When I'm with you, I'm never alone
I need to feel you, feel you tonight
I need to tell you that it's alright

We'll never be as young as we are now
It's time to leave this old black and white town
Let's seize the day
Let's run away
Don't let the colors fade to grey
We'll never be as young as we are now
As young as we are now

I see myself here in your eyes
Stay awake till the sunrise
I want to hold you, hold you all night
I want to tell you that you're all mine

I feel our hands intertwine
Hear our hearts beating in time
I need to hold you, hold you all night
I need to tell you that you're all mine

We'll never be as young as we are now
It's time to leave this old black and white town
Let's seize the day
Let's run away
Don't let the colors fade to grey
We'll never be as young as we are now
As young as we are now

We won't wait
For tomorrow
It's too late
We don't follow

We won't wait
For tomorrow
It's too late
We don't follow

We'll never be as young as we are now
It's time to leave this old black and white town
Let's seize the day
Let's run away
Don't let the colors fade to grey
We'll never be as young as we are now
As young as we are now
As young as we are now
