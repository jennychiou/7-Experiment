Turn it up Pump it up
Turn it up
Just a little bit

Turn it up
Pump it up
Turn it up
Just a little bit

All the kids gonna bounce to this
All the kids gonna jump to this
All the kids gonna snap to this

Yeah, rock it rhyme

Little Aaron

How many people understand me that this is why
Ya growin' up to go to school, and that's a fact
Getting a job from the school, loan 'n' pay 'em back
Then you get a car to make it to the job and back
Can you tell me why things gotta be this way

I'd rather be at the pool catchin' sunrays
Guys in the deep end
Girls in the shallow
Kids in the middle shout "MARCO POLO!"
When a get a little older Imma change things

Makin' life go easy like ice cream
Become president and play on the dream team
Bring home the gold medal for the ladies
But I guess right now Imma sit back
While I watch Scooby-Doo eat a Scooby snack
Grab a pen and some paper from my knapsack
And do a little homework for my math class

So have fun - that's my point of view
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
And if you do, you'll never lose
The kid in you, the kid in you
Whoa!

I be the one that be dropping the hints
Lacing the beats
Into to the streets
Bringing the heat
Copping the chicks
I'll be your mix
Never forget what, what, what being a kid is

Even though I got a lot of dough
I keep it real
I still play my Sega Dreamcast
When I chill
Nickelodeon on when I'm eatin' meals
And I bought the big screen with the Zomba Deal
Listen up, to you kids all across the land
I still rock my Timberlands every time I can
Never miss an episode of the Batman
Still watching re-runs of the X-Men

And I still show love to my parents
Doing chores when I'm home running errands
Come to the crib, eat a ham sandwich
And when I'm around ya, you know what
I'm wearing, Timberlands

So have fun - that's my point of view
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
And if you do, you'll never lose
The kid in you, the kid in you
Whoa

Yo, everyone wanna be stuck in their old ways
Never wanna change when the get a certain age
Not me AC, gonna be this way
Stay this way, always say yo, yo

So have fun - that's my point of view
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
And if you do, you'll never lose
The kid in you

So have fun - that's my point of view
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
And if you do, you'll never lose
The kid in you, the kid in you
The kid in you
