Baby, baby
Baby, baby

Deep inside I need you with me baby
You maximise your love, it's drive me crazy
Gonna take my time
Gonna make this real

The way you're touching me it sets me free
Come on and liberate me girl
Your body heat it tastes so sweet

Heart, soul, let your lovin' show
Baby don't you know
When I need your love baby
Heart, soul, let your lovin' flow
Baby don't you know
Baby, baby, baby

When I need your love baby

Movin' down I feel your heat shake through me
Touch and feel your love, when we break free
Gonna make you mine
Gonna make this real

The way you're touching me it sets me free
Come on and liberate me girl
Your body heat it tastes so sweet

Heart, soul, let your lovin' show
Baby don't you know
When I need your love baby
Heart, soul, let your lovin' flow
Baby don't you know
Baby, baby, baby

Heart, soul, let your lovin' show
Baby don't you know
When I need your love baby
Heart, soul, let your lovin' flow
Baby don't you know
Baby, baby, baby
