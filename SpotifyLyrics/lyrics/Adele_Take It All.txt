Didn't I give it all, tried my best?
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me around
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here

But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily, I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is for you

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
