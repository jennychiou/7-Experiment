Backstreet 
Listen up 

This scene's so hypnotic 
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic 
Paper faces in gold 
There's solider boys, beauty queens 
Everyone's a mystery 
It's got me losing control 

Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes 
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 

Just like a perfect dream 
I don't ever wanna leave 
A thousand freaks in the show 
One's a tiger, one's a lynx 
One's a king that suffering 
Moving high, moving low 
Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes? 
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 

I gotta know the girl behind the mask 
Let me in, where you've been, don't pretend 
Dreamed that I had her alone 
Show your face to me, we could be everything 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay 

A masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade
