I've been staring at the ceiling
Watching the fans flow around, round and round
'Cause I can't hear my breathing
The words we said are still so loud, loud, loud

And we been drifting off so far
And I don't even know where we are
Before we jump, before we leave
And all is lost for you and me, yeah

If we're not stupid
We'll both hold on for dear love
Find our way through this
It's not worth just giving up
'Cause I've got some fire left in me
And I don't see us ending this way
If we're not stupid
We'll both hold on for dear love, love

I've been weighed down by the silence
All these words that don't come out, out
Been tempted just to write it
And say I'm sorry without a sound, sound, sound

'Cause we been drifting off so far
That I don't even know where we are
But we can try and we can speak
Before we're lost indefinitely

If we're not stupid
We'll both hold on for dear love
Find our way through this
It's not worth just giving up
'Cause I've got some fire left in me
And I don't see us ending this way
If we're not stupid
We'll both hold on for dear love, love

I been terribly human
Using you like a punching bag
And you been terribly angry
Taking out all your worst words on me
And I see what we were
And I know that we've hurt
But I know that it's worth it to fight
For all our love tonight

If we're not stupid
We'll both hold on for dear love
Find our way through this
It's not worth just giving up
'Cause I've got some fire left in me
And I don't see us ending this way
If we're not stupid
We'll both hold on for dear love, love
Love, love, love
