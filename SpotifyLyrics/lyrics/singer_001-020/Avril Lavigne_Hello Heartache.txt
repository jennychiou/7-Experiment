You were perfect
I was unpredictable
It was more than worth it, but not too sensible

Young and foolish
Seemed to be the way
I was stupid to think that I could stay
Oh oh
To think that I could stay

Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It's not the end
It's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way
You will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache

La la la la la la la la 
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la 

I was champagne
You were Jameson
Every bad thing we did was so much fun

I've seen your best side
You got to see my worst
It's not the first time, but this one really hurts
Oh oh
Yeah this one's going to, it hurts

Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It's not the end
It's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but you will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache

La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 

La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 

Do you know
Do you get
It's just goodbye 
It's not the end
Do you know
Do you get
It's just goodbye 
It's not the end

Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It's not the end
It's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but you will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache

La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 

Hello heartache
(Hello heartache)
Wish it didn't have to be this way
But you will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
