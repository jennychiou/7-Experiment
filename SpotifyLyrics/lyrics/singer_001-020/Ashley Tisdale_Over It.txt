(Telephone ringing)
(Boy) Hello?
(Ashley) Hey you know what?
I don't need this.
I can not believe you
Over her?!
And why you gotta lie about it?!
That's it, I'm over it

Every time I saw you, I tried to pretend
Now I think you're caught in a spin
Said that I could trust you be my everything
Fallin' from the shadows, now I see

All those times were wasted
And you tried to hide it from me

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So why is it so hard to see
All the lies you're tellin' me
I'm gettin' out, I'm movin' on
I'm over it

I'm over it
I'm over it

Tried to walk away
But my heart was saying no
Can't believe it took so
Long to go
Now the past is fading
I hardly know your name
Don't know what you're doing
You lost the game

All those times were wasted
And you tried to hide it from me

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So why is it so hard to see
All the lies you're tellin' me
I'm gettin' out, I'm movin' on
I'm over it

I don't care (I'm over it)
Whatever (I'm over it)
So why is it? (I'm over it)
Getting... (I'm over it)

All those times were wasted
And you tried to hide it from me

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So why is it so hard to see
All the lies you're tellin' me
I'm gettin' out, I'm movin' on
I'm over it

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So why is it so hard to see
All the lies you're tellin' me
I'm gettin' out, I'm movin' on
I'm over it

I'm over it
I'm over it (uh huh)
I'm over it
I'm over it
I'm over it (over you baby)
I'm over it

(Laughing)
