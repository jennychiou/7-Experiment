Let me tell you about this girl I know
First glance and damn she stole my heart
She amazes me

The way she moves, just the way she moves
Hold me back just the way she moves
Take me to the Disco
Make me dance

Oh Honey spinnin round' like a Queen
And the way you do your thing
Oh you're mesmerizing me
Oh Imma tell you how I feel
And the feeling is so real
Baby
It's so simple

You've got to call me
And Imma call you back
Kiss me
Imma kiss you back
Love me
And baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me, trust me

Hold me, whenever you're alone
Baby, even when your crazy
Love me, Baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me

Our love, you and me
Underneath the willow tree
Kissing, loving, making sweet sexy baby
The grass is greener on the other side
There's no other side when it's you and I
Tonight, Lets count the stars

Yeah, oh Time will always be Our enemy
For tonight baby, Come lie here next to me
I can never get enough of your blue eyes
Just another butterfly sigh

You've got to call me
And Imma call you back
Kiss me
Imma kiss you back
Love me
And baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me, trust me

Hold me, Whenever you're alone
Baby, even when your crazy
Love me, Baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me

Oh lets believe that well find out
How it feels with something so right
Don't you think it's time
To let your guard down

You've got to call me
And Imma call you back
Kiss me
Imma kiss you back
Love me
And baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me, trust me

Hold me, Whenever you're alone
Baby, even when your crazy
Love me, Baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me

You've got to call me
And Imma call you back
Kiss me
Imma kiss you back
Love me
And baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me, trust me

Hold me, Whenever you're alone
Baby, even when your crazy
Love me, Baby Imma love you back
You've got to trust me
