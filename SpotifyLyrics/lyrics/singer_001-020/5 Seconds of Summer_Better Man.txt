Find me at a quarter to three, cigarette in hand
I'd be at every party, I wouldn't miss a chance
New friends again and again, gone when the morning comes
Demons I try to defend, but I couldn't get enough

Fading away, fading away
Wake up to someone with nothing to say
I'd never change, thought I'd never change
Then you come and change it all

With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darling, all of my wrongs, they lead me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for you
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man

Thought I'd found the highest of highs
You came and topped them all
You shine in the dead of the night
And I was the first to fall

Fading away, fading away
Wake up to someone with nothing to say
I'd never change, thought I'd never change
Then you come and change it all

With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darling, all of my wrongs, they lead me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for you
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man

You're the only one, who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love, that can make this bad man better
You're the only one, who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love, that can make this bad man better

With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darling, all of my wrongs, they lead me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for you
Your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darling, all of my wrongs, they lead me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for you
Your love, your love, I'm a better, better man

Your love, your love, your love
I'm a better, better man
Your love, your love, love, love
I'm a better, better man
