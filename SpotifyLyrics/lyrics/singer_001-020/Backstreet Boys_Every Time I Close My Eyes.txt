Everytime
I
Close my eyes
Everytime
I
Close my eyes

Listen girl
I don't know where to start
But every word I say
Comes straight from the heart
I've been so wrong
I never meant to hurt you
Oh girl
I'm sorry
Of what I put you through

Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
(One more chance)
'Cause I want you back again
(Want you back again)

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now that I've realized
I want you girl
And no other
Everytime I close my eyes
You're all that I see

You and I shared it all together
Each other was all we'd ever need
(All we ever need)
I thought that you would stay
With me forever
But I took for granted
The love you gave to me
I keep on trying
(Keep on trying)
Until the end
(Until the end)
Baby I need you back with me
Again

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now that I've realized
I want you girl
And no other
Everytime I close my eyes
You're all that I see

Girl, I'm going out of my mind
I miss you so much
I don't know what to do
(What to do)
Please say it's just a matter of time
Until I feel your touch
Until you let me come back to you

Think about you girl
Every day and night and day
I'm in love
And it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you
Or cause you pain
I was just caught up
In that lying game
But now those days are over
I've changed my ways
And now I'm counting the minutes
I'm counting the days
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start
To find a new way
To get back into your heart

Girl, I'd do anything for one more chance
(One more chance)
'Cause I want you
I want you back again
(Want you back)

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now that I've realized
I want you girl
And no other
Everytime I close my eyes
You're all that I see

(All I can see is you lovin' me
You're all that I need
Baby yeah
Oh
Now I realize
That every time I close my eyes
I see me holdin' and kissin' you
Baby yeah
I see your face
And I wonder
I wonder
Yeah
Oh, yeah)
