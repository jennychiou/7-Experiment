All...that I did was walk over
Start off by shaking your hands
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face 
And I sat up straight

Oh, yeah yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away

(I'm so unwanted)
No
I just don't understand why                      
You won't talk to me
It hurts
That I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me

I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away

I tried to belong
It didn't seem wrong
My head aches
It's been so long
I'll write this song
If that's what it takes 
Yeah

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You'd just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You'd just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away
Make me go away
