I saw a picture of you
Hanging in an empty hallway
I heard a voice that I knew
And I couldn't walk away

It took me back to the end
Of everything
I tasted all, I tasted all the tears
Again

Outside the rain is pouring down
There's not a drop that hits me
Scream at the sky but no sound
Is leaving my lips

It's like I can't even feel
After the way you touched me
I'm not asleep, I'm not awake
After the way you loved me

I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls
That I can't break down

I said
I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut
Because of you
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker

Let me out of this dream

Everywhere that I go
I see another memory
And all the places we used to know
They're always there to haunt me

I walk around and I feel
So lost and lonely
You're everything that I want
But you don't want me

I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls
That I can't break down

I said
I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut
Because of you
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker

Let me out of this dream
Let me out of this dream

I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls
That I can't break down

I said
I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut
Because of you
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker
I'm a sleepwalker, walker, walker

Let me out of this dream
