When you're gone
When you're gone, it's like I'm in one second in time
I'm frozen
When you're gone
When you're gone, it's like I lost one half of my mind
Stolen

'Cause nobody feels you like I do
Nobody kills me like you do
Nothing I take can ever cut through
I'm in trouble
I look at myself and I don't know
How I'm stuck to you like Velcro
Can't rip you off and go solo
I'm in trouble

I'm hooked on how you made
Me hooked, I'm gonna say it straight
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked; I can't cut you off
In my blood; I'm gonna say it now
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground

I'm hooked on how you made
Me hooked, I'm gonna say it straight
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked; I can't cut you off
In my blood; I'm gonna say it now
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground

When you go
When you go, it's like I put my life on the line
It's over
When you go
When you go, I'm tripping but I'm pretending I'm fine
So dumb

'Cause nobody feels you like I do
Nobody kills me like you do
Nothing I take can ever cut through
I'm in trouble
I look at myself and I don't know
How I'm stuck to you like Velcro
Can't rip you off and go solo
I'm in trouble

I'm hooked on how you made
Me hooked, I'm gonna say it straight
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked; I can't cut you off
In my blood; I'm gonna say it now
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground

I'm hooked on how you made
Me hooked, I'm gonna say it straight
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked; I can't cut you off
In my blood; I'm gonna say it now
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground

You got me hooked on you
Now I'm in trouble
Trouble, trouble, yeah

I'm hooked on how you made
Me hooked, I'm gonna say it straight
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked; I can't cut you off
In my blood; I'm gonna say it now
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground

I'm hooked on how you made
Me hooked, I'm gonna say it straight
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked; I can't cut you off
In my blood; I'm gonna say it now
I want you, I need you
I want you to take me underground
