Try to tell me what I shouldn't do
You should know by now, I won't listen to you
Walk around with my hands up in the air
'Cause I don't care

'Cause I'm all right I'm fine

Just freak out let it go
I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide I won't compromise 'cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out let it go
Just freak out let it go

You don't always have to do everything right
Stand up for yourself
And put up a fight
Walk around with your hands up in the air like you don't care

'Cause I'm all right I'm fine

Just freak out let it go
I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide I won't compromise 'cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out let it go

On my own
Let it go
Yeah yeah yeah

Just let me live my life
I can't ever run and hide I won't compromise 'cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out let it go

Gonna freak out let it go
Gonna freak out let it go
