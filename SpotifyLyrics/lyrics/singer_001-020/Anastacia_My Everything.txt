You're the air that breathes in me
You're the wind beneath my wings
You make me rise above
We're building castles of love

My god, my god my god, my god
You're my, you're my, you're my, you're my
You're my everything

You're the rush inside my veins
Filled with love I can't contain
With all that we've been through
I'll paint stars with you

My god, my god my god, my god
You're my, you're my, you're my, you're my
You're my everything

You make me hold my head up high
I swear I touch the sky
I'm melting to the ground
'Cause in your eyes I found I surrender all of me
I'm yours eternally
I'm yours eternally

My god, my god my god, my god
You're my, you're my, you're my, you're my
You're my everything
