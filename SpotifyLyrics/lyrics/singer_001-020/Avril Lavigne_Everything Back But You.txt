Today was the worst day, I went through hell
I wish I could remove it from my mind
Two months away from you but I couldn't tell
I thought that everything was gonna be just fine

The postcard that you wrote with the stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
Smelled like cheap perfume and it didn't smell like you
There is no way you can get around it
Because you wrote

I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Bitch, slut, psycho babe
I hate you--why are guys so lame?
Everything I gave you I want everything back but you

My friends tried to tell me all along
That you weren't the right one for me
My friends tried to tell me to be strong
I bet you didn't think that I would see

The postcard that you wrote with the stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
I wanna see you cry like I did a thousand times
Yeah you're losing me, you're losing me now
Because you wrote

I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Bitch, slut, psycho babe
I hate you--why are guys so lame?
Everything I gave you I want everything back but you

The postcard that you wrote with the stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
Smelled like cheap perfume and it didn't smell like you
There is no way you can get around it
Because you wrote

I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Bitch, slut, psycho babe
I hate you--why are guys so lame?
Everything I gave you I want everything back but you

I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
Everything back but you
I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
Everything back but you
