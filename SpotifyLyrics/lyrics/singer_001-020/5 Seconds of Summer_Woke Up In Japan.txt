I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty
I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty

It was more than just a neon weekend
Light slipping through the third floor curtain
Spreading love like the morning news from the day before

Falling fast, breathing slow
Time is up, the end is just a dream
Just a dream

I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty

It's enough to let the night let go of me
A few steps into the open doorway
Heart pounding, there's a noise complaint from room 304

Falling fast, breathing slow
Time is up, the end is just a dream
Just a dream

I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty
I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty
I woke up in Japan, woah
I woke up in Japan, woah
