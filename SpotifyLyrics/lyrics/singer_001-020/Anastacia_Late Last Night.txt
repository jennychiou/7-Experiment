Saw you in the restaurant
Late last night
You were looking in her eyes
Holding her hand tight
Said that you were working late
Well I guess that's true
You were working on somebody new
Ah

So you were in a restaurant with someone else
Why you were busy fooling me
Well I guess I fooled myself
But I won't be the fool again
And I tell you now
I won't stay around
While you play around
So
So baby pack your lies and walk right out this door
No no
I don't want your tight excuses anymore
No no
I don't wanna hear the same old lies (by the same old price)
'Cause I'm through... wasting my time on loving you

Did you give your to her late last night
Did you say those things you said
When we turned out the light
When she went to touch your hand
Did you hide the ring? Haha
Did you forget to tell her about me?
Yes you did

I saw you leave the restaurant
And get in her car
I don't know where you went
But this time you went to far
Stumbling in the door at four in the morning
Just won't do
I won't stay around no
While you play around with my heart

So baby pack your lies and walk right out this door
Oh No no no no
I don't want your tight excuses anymore
No no
I don't wanna hear the same old lies (by the same old price)
('Cause I'm through) I'm so through baby, wasting my time on loving you

Didn't I give you the best of my love? (of my love)
Was it Worse or in bad
Didn't I care enough (I care enough oh)
How could you go and just hurt me that way (hurt me that way)
Well I'm not gonna take it no more
Nononono

(So baby pack your lies and walk right out this door)
No walk right out the door baby (oh no)
I don't want your tight excuses anymore
Nono (nono)
I don't wanna hear the same old lies again (by the same old price)
('Cause I'm through)
I'm so through baby - wasting my time - I'm wasting my time
(Wasting my time on loving you)

(So baby pack your lies and walk right out this door)
I don't wanna waste it baby (oh no)
(I don't want your tight excuses anymore)
I don't want your tight excuses
I don't wanna hear the same old lies again (by the same old price)
('Cause I'm through)
I'm so through baby - wasting my time - I'm wasting my time
(Wasting my time on loving you)
