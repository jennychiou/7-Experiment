Oh, oh, oh I, I was a city boy
Riding to danger's where I'd always run
A boy who had his fun
But I wouldn't of done
All the things that I have done
If I knew, one day you'd come

Now baby "(now baby)"
Now baby "(now baby)"

Oh, oh, oh I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you wanna love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't of done
All the things that I've done
If I knew, one day you'd come

Now baby "(now baby)"
Now baby "(now baby)"

Oh baby please
Let's leave the past behind us, behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, we'll find us

I know once girls would leave me
But I know that you'll believe me

Baby I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't of done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd come
