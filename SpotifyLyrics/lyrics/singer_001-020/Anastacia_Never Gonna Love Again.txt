Last night I woke up in a daze. 
Dreamt I had lost you for always. 
If it came to be a reality, 
It'd be the end of a show. 
I would find a rest cause the emptiness, 
Would never let me go. 

I know there'll never be, 
Another you and me. 
My heart beats only for you. 
I'll never love again. 
(Never gonna, Never gonna love again) 
I'll never love again. 
(Never gonna, Never gonna love again) 
I'll never love again. 

Looking in your eyes, I'm not alone. 
Can't believe how much our love can take, 
And still grow. 
And we both have seen all the wedding rings, 
Just cast out in the rain. 
It's so clear to me with my history, 
I can't go back there again. 

I know there'll never be, 
Another you and me. 
My heart beats only for you. 
I'll never love again. 
(Never gonna, Never gonna love a, Never gonna love again) 
I'll never love again. 
(Never gonna, Never gonna love a, Never gonna love again) 
I'll never love again. 

I know there'll never be, 
Another you and me. 
My heart beats only for you. 
I'll never love again. 
I'll never love again. 
I'll never love again.
