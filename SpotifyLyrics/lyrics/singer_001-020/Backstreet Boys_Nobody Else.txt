Just memorizing lines upon your face
I made a map, every photo and the details on the frames
And just last night we spilled red wine, how it stained the floor
And though I know that nothing ever really stays the same, no

Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
Even though it's selfish

I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

Torn by the way your voice is changing on the phone
All this space in between us makes it hard to feel close to you (Close to you)
And just last night I had some red wine and it brought me back
No matter what I'll remember you forever like that, you know (Like that, you know)

Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
And never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
That even though it's selfish, oh

I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

Nobody, nobody, nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody, nobody, nobody else (No, no)
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else? (Nobody, nobody, nobody)
I said people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else? (I know it's selfish)

I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else (Nobody else)
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else (Can't compare you)
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else? (Nobody else)
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else
