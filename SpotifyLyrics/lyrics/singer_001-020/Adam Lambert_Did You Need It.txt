So one of us
Has to go. We know
One of us,
Yeah,
Come on, it's time to go.
And was the spotlight
Up above you
Shining so bright?
A searchlight,
Signaling.
Ah yeah.

And as the storm
Rolls in, yeah,
Leaving all we've been.
I guess there's a first time for everything

And was the spotlight
Up above you
Shining so bright?
A searchlight,
Signaling.
Ah yeah.

And where the hell
Did you
Go?
And was the road
Too long?

And was the spotlight
Up above you
Shining so bright?
A searchlight
Signaling
To bring you home
Always wanting.
You found oh the limelight.

Did you need it?
Did you want it?
Did you find it?
Did you need it?

And where the hell
Did you
Go?
And was the road
Too long?
