You baptize my soul
Want the world to know
Yes you do
You baptize my soul
Gotta let it show
Take me to the river and deliver me
Ooh ooh

I just wanna celebrate another day with you
We were meant to be together, don't you know it's true?
From the very start, you captured my heart
Sometimes I wonder what I did before we came along
Until you came around and sang me such a pretty song
Like a butterfly, opened up and changed my life
Giving in to you is something that I can't deny
Ooh

You (you) baptize my soul
I want the world to know
You manifest the 'D' in destiny (Yes you do)
I said you (you) baptize my soul
Gotta let it show
Take me to the river and deliver me
Just take this empty heart, make it whole
You baptize my soul

Just the sound of your voice brings out the romance in me
The slightest touch of your hand plays me like a symphony
Love'll take us far, like a shooting star
We don't pay no mind to all the things that people say
The only thing that matters is the love we've got today
It's a miracle, we're invinsible
I just wanna spend my whole life living in your world
Ooh

You (you) baptize my soul
I want the world to know
You manifest the 'D' in destiny (Yes you do)
I said you (you) baptize my soul
Gotta let it show
Take me to the river and deliver me
Take this empty heart, make it whole
You baptize my soul

You (you) baptize my soul
I want the world to know
You manifest the 'D' in destiny (Yes you do)
I said you (you) baptize my soul
Gotta let it show
Take me to the river and deliver me
And take this empty heart, make it whole
You baptize my soul

I don't care what people say
What we got is here to stay
Doesn't matter what we do
As long as I am here with you
If you wonder what I mean
It's more simple than it seems
Together we were meant to be
Forever it is you and me

Like a butterfly
Opened up my life
Giving in to you is something
That I can't deny

You (you) baptize my soul
I want the world to know
You manifest the 'D' in destiny (Yes you do)
I said you (you) baptize my soul
Gotta let it show
Take me to the river and deliver me
And take this empty heart, make it whole
You baptize my soul

You baptize my soul
I want the world to know
