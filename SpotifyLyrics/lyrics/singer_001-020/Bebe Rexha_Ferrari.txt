Every day's a blur
Sometimes I can't tell what day it is
Don't know what day it is
Can you tell me what day it is?
Life's passing by
'Cause I'm out chasing empty highs
Every hello just means goodbye
But I'm looking for more this time

Can we start to slow it down?
Can we learn to live right now?
I just want to feel it all
Oh-ooh-ooh!

I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari and after the party is done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kind of lonely (yeah)

Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Living in the fast lane's getting kind of lonely
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Living in the fast lane's getting kind of lonely

Got a heavy heart
'Cause it's still beating on its own
Might be going out in the crowd
But I'm still coming home alone
Not trying to say I'm not grateful for everything
I'm just going too fast to see
All the good things in front of me

I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari and after the party is done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kind of lonely

Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Living in the fast lane's getting kind of lonely
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari and after the party is done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kind of lonely
