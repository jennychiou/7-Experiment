How you gonna tell me that you love me when you know
You're too afraid to call it love, let go
How you gonna lie and say you call, but girl you don't
'Cause I'm here going through my phone, oh no

You're stuck in your ways
I'm stuck in this place
My hands are stuck on your waist, but you know that
I'm running your chase
You're way out of place
We're losing this race together

Almost there
Tell me that you're almost there
I can see you're almost there
I know that you're almost there
Almost there
Tell me that you're almost there
I can see you're almost there
I know that you're almost there

I can see you're almost there
Almost there
I can see you're almost there

How you gonna try and keep a secret when you know
Everyone already knows, they know
Why you wanna have your heart in pieces on the floor
I'm just tryna keep it whole

You're stuck in your ways
I'm stuck in this place
My hands are stuck on your waist, but you know that
I'm running your chase
You're way out of place
We're losing this race, together

Almost there
Tell me that you're almost there
I can see you're almost there
I know that you're almost there

Tell me that you're almost there
I can see you're
I can see you're almost there
Almost there

Almost there
Tell me that you're almost there
I can see you're almost there
I know that you're almost there

Tell me that you're almost there
I can see you're
I can see you're almost there
