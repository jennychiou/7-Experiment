Arrived after sunset
Left before midnight
Don't let me lose you now
'Cause my heart is racin'
You're crossin' my lines
I got to get home somehow

How could I let you get behind the wheel
When you drive so close to the edge
Makin' me wanna crash here again and again and again

So why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love
Why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love

My blood's rushin' baby
I love where you take me
But something so right can't last
I thought you could save me
Our future is fading
'Cause we're movin' way too fast

How could I let you get behind the wheel
When you drive so close to the edge
Makin' me wanna crash here again and again and again

So why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love
Why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love

Said gone too long can't afford to stop
Relax my pretty baby I don't you feel the shock
You push too hard till you're hittin' the floor
I keep reachin' right around you to unlock the door
Again and again and again

So why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love
Why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love

You get too reckless with my love

You get too reckless with my love

So why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love
Why don't you hold on
Drive home
You get too reckless with my love
