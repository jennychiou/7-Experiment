Wings of an angel
Replaced by beautiful scars
Well hidden in the dark
Time seems to stand still
The world is falling apart
So heavy on my heart
And it's raining
And it all comes crashing down
Anyone would give up
But not me not now

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found a strength I never knew I had in me
With these broken wings

Turning the pages
Cuts like a knife once again
Where does the end begins?
Through all the stages
A silent fighter remains
You got to lose to win
Through the fire
And the smoke starts to clear
Anyone would give up
But not now not here

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found a strength I never knew I had in me
With these broken wings

I said I never doubt it
Wrapped my hands around you
Changed my everything

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found a strength I never knew I had in me
With these broken wings
