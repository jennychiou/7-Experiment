Somebody told me you were not coming home,
The words suspended in time, and the air suddenly went cold,
The sun is still shining, but everything feels like rain
And if I had one wish, it would be to see you again

Nothings fair, when we lose
Without a moment to say good bye

How come the world won't stop spinning now that you're gone?
I know every end has beginnings
But this ones so wrong, so wrong

Caught in the middle,
Wrong place wrong time,
And I'm hopelessly missing you,
And I can't stop the night

Nothings fair, anymore,
And I know there's a better place,
And I'll never stop dreaming of you

How come the world won't stop spinning
Now that you're gone?
I know every end has beginnings
But this ones so wrong, so wrong
How can the seasons keep changing
Since you disappeared?
Tell me how come the world won't stop,
How come the world wont stop.

Sweet tears are shared,
This pain we lay to rest,
It's hard letting go,
But I keep movin on,
In a place I don't belong.

How come the world wont stop spinning
Now that you're gone?
I know every end has beginnings
But this ones so wrong
How can the seasons keep changing
Since you disappeared.

Tell me how come the world won't stop,
How come the world won't stop

How come the world won't stop spinning
Now that you're gone?
I know every end has beginnings but this one's so wrong,
So wrong.
