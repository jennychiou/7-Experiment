Do you ever sit? In silence all alone?
Drowned out by your thoughts?
Tryna get a grip, but just keep on spiralling down
Voices getting loud
Feeling something now
Only you know where to will
Do you ever sleep? With troubles in your head?
Wrapped up in regrets?
Reaching for the help you gotta find inside yourself
You're stuck inside a spell
Don't need nobody else, -body else

So don't you mind
I'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

Maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)
Yeah, maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)

I need to get away from inside my brain
I feel some type of way
I'm dancing all alone, surrounded by everyone else
I do it to myself
Not asking for your help, for your help

So don't you mind
I'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

Maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)
Yeah, maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)

So don't you mind
I'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

Maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)
Yeah, maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)
