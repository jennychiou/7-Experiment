It's the first time I've ever felt this lonely 
I wish someone could cure this pain
It's funny when you think it's gonna work out
'Til ya chose weed over me, you're so lame

I thought you were cool until the point
Up until the point 
You didn't call me
When you said you would
Finally figured out you're all the same
Always coming up with some kind of story

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh,
You can't
You're too tough
You think you're loveless
Is that too much that I'm asking for?

Thought you'd come around when I ignored you
Sorta thought you'd have the decency to change
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning
'Cause I'm not about, to look at your face again

Can't you see that you lie to yourself?
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

But every time I try to make you smile
You always go on feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You stand like a stone
Alone in your zone
Is that too much that I'm askin' for?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't find where I am
Lying here
Alone in fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim
Alone again

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't you see that you lie to yourself?
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

But every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't
You're too tough
You think you're loveless
It was too much that I asked him for
