Oh...

I open my eyes, I see your face
I cannot hide, I can't erase
The way you make me feel inside
You complete me girl, that's why
Something about you makes me feel

I'm down on my knees, I'm askin' you
Say these three words I wanna hear from you

Yes I will
Take your hand and walk with you

This is no ordinary love
And I can never have enough
Of all the things you've given to me
You're my heart, my soul, my everything
Every night, I thank you Lord
For giving me the strength to love her
More and more each day
I promise her as long as I hear those three words

"Till death do us part, I promise to you"
