I heard rumors
You've been quick to hide me
Truth hurts consumes you
Bet you thought you got me

I hoped that you'd come home
So I thought I'd leave the light on

Had to find out, find out like this
Each time the lies fall off our lips
Had to find out 'cause you let it slip
And I feel the same way

I feel the same way

If you don't wanna stay
You ain't gotta stay
Make you wanna run away
I don't wanna chase no more
You won't even say my name
Say my name, say my name
You should feel so ashamed
I feel the same way

I heard you know
I was quick to hide things
Lovers, truth hurts
Guess I'll let you find me

I hoped that you'd come home
So I thought I'd leave the light on

Had to find out, find out like this
Each time the lies fall off our lips
Had to find out 'cause you let it slip
And I feel the same ways

I feel the same way

If you don't wanna stay
You ain't gotta stay
Make you wanna run away
I don't wanna chase no more
You won't even say my name
Say my name, say my name
You should feel so ashamed
I feel the same way

I feel the same way

I feel the same way
