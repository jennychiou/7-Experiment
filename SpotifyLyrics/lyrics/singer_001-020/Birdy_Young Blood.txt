We're only young and naive still
We require certain skills
The mood, it changes like the wind
Hard to control when it begins

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-between
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate

We lie beneath the stars at night
Our hands gripping each other tight
You keep my secrets, hope to die
Promises, swear them to the sky

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-between
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah

As it withers
Brittle, it shakes
Can you whisper
As it crumbles and breaks?

As you shiver
Count up all your mistakes
Pair of forgivers
Let go before it's too late

Can you whisper?
Can you whisper?

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-between
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-between
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah
