So I got my boots on, got the right amount of leather
And I'm doing me up with a black color liner
And I'm working my strut, but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

There's a thin line between the dark side
And the light side, baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble
Tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you, y-y-you, y-y-you, y-y-you
If I had you

From New York to LA, getting high, rock and rolling
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rolling in Maseratis
What they need in this world is some love

There's a thin line between the wild time
And a flat-line, baby tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble
Tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you, y-y-you, y-y-you, y-y-you
If I had

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
But I got you stuck on my mind, yeah

The flashing and the stage
It might get me alright
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you, y-y-you, y-y-you, y-y-you

If I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you, y-y-you, y-y-you, y-y-you
If I had you
