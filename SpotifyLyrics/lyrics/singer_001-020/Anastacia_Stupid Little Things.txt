Stuck on the wrong side of heaven
But I did it to myself, I did it to myself
Traded in my forever
But I did it to myself, I did it to myself

When I get too close to my someday
Every time I blow it away
Praying I will come to my senses
Won't be my own worst enemy
And I put my heart back together
Yeah, I put my heart back together

Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt
Till I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you

Treated love like a bad religion
Yeah, I did it to myself, I did it to myself
But I won't stay here unforgiven
When I did it to myself, I did it to myself

When I get too close to my someday
Every time I blow it away
Praying I will come to my senses
Won't be my own worst enemy
And I put my heart back together
I said I put my heart back together

Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt
Till I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you
Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt
Till I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you

Living in a world of fantasy
There is nothing left of me
Now I gotta face reality
Hold on trying to believe
I don't want to give up on you

Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt
Till I give up on these stupid little things
(Till I give up on these stupid things)
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you
That keep me from you
Now I know what love is worth (keep me from you)
In a broken world (keep me from you)
But I can't get past the hurt
Till I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you
Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt (that keep me from you)
Till I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
