I feel oh so glamorous, looking super fabulous
Sometimes I'm insecure, something I can't ignore
All the flashy cameras, try my best to handle it
I'm just the girl next door, I can hear the rumors take off

All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they want to be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, not that girl
And it's not, not, no it's not my world

So many girls be checkin' my style
Checkin' my style, checkin' my style
So many girls be checkin' my style
But I don't even care, no

I move in mysterious, ways that got them curious
They're looking at what I'm wearing, standing on the sidelines staring
Taking every chance I get, to find who I'm going with
I just wish they'd see, what I'm like in real life

All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they want to be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, not that girl
And it's not, not, no it's not my world

So many girls be checkin' my style
Checkin' my style, checkin' my style
So many girls be checkin' my style
But I don't even care, no

What's good I'm weak no longer
In life it's making me stronger
What I like I'ma get that
Like a quick cat, no I won't quit that, you heard me
You'll find that I'm just like you
And I do the same things you do
The type of chick that hits spots, in my flip-flops
Listening to Hip-Hop, you feel me

All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they want to be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, not that girl
And it's not, not, no it's not my world

All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they want to be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, not that girl
And it's not, not, no it's not my world
