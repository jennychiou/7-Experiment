Lala, lalalala, lala, lalala

I like your smile
I like your vibe
I like your style
But that's not why I love you
And I, I like the way
You're such a star
But that's not why I love you
Hey, do you feel, do you feel me
Do you feel what I feel too
Do you need, do you need me
Do you need me

You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you,
Is you being you, just you
Yeah the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you

Lala, lalalala, lala, lalala

I like the way you misbehave
When we get wasted
But that's not why I love you
And how you keep your cool when I am complicated
But that's not why I love you

Hey, do you feel, do you feel me
Do you feel what I feel too
Do you need, do you need me
Do you need me

You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
And I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you,
Is you being you, just you
Yeah the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you

Even though we didn't make it through
I am always here for you... you

You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you,
Is you being you, just you
Yeah the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you

Lala, lalalala
(Oh oh)
Lala, lalalala
(That's why I love you)
Lala, lalalala
(Oh oh)
Lala, lalalala
(That's why I love you)
