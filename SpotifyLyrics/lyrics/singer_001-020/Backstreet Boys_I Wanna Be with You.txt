I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
I wanna be with you

I'd like to know your policy
When it comes to me
I'd like to know what's in your mind
It's not easy to see
I know now what I feel
And what to do
I wanna be with you

And I'll be waiting
Until you face the truth
When the light is fading
You know what I wanna do

I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
(You know it's true)
And everything I do
(Is for you baby)
I wanna be with you
(Oh with you)
Everybody say hey!
Yeah
See you once again
Yeah
Everybody swing
Yeah
Everybody
Yeah
Everybody swing

Wish you'd come and set me free
So that I can see
All the things I've left behind
What's missing in me
I'm looking for a sign
In the things you do
I wanna be with you

And I'll be waiting
Until you face the truth
When the light is fading
You know what I wanna do

I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
(You know it's true)
And everything I do
(Is for you baby)
I wanna be with you
(Oh with you)
Everybody say hey!
Yeah
See you once again
Yeah
Everybody swing
Yeah
Everybody
Yeah
Everybody swing

I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
(Oh, oh, oh)
I wanna be with you

I wanna be with you
(Yeah)
It's crazy but it's true
(Yeah)
And everything I do
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
It's crazy but it's true
(It's crazy but it's true)
And everything I do
(And everything I do)
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
Hey
And everything I do
I wanna be with you
