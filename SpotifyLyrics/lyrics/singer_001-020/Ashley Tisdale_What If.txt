Don't speak, I can't believe this is here happening
Our situation isn't right
Get real, who you playing with
I never thought he'd be like this
You were supposed to be there by my side

When you say that you want me
I just don't believe it
You're always ready to give up
And never turn around

But what if I need you baby
Would you even try to save me
Or would you find some lame excuse to never be true
What if I said I loved you
Would you be the one to run to
Or would you watch me walk away without a fight

I'm so sick of worrying that ya
Gonna quit over anything
I could trip and you'd let go like that
And everything that we ever were
Seems to fade but not the hurt
'Cause you don't know the good things from the bad

When I say that I want you
You know that I mean it
And in my hour of weakness
There's still time to try

But what if I need you baby
Would you even try to save me
Or would you find some lame excuse to never be true
What if I said I loved you
Would you be the one to run to
Or would you watch me walk away without a fight

Every time I speak you try and stop me
'Cause every little thing I say is wrong
You say you're noticing but you never see
This is who I really am that you can believe
Makes me wanna know right now
Is it me you'll live without
Or would you change your mind

But what if I need you
But what if I need you baby
Would you even try to save me
Or would you find some lame excuse to never be true
What if I said I loved you
Would you be the one to run to
Or would you watch me walk away without a fight
Oh baby, what if I need you
What if I need you
What if I need you
