Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na

Yeah, you could show up at my front door
On a white horse, I'll be ready
We can jump out of an airplane
We can fall like we're confetti
Just like kites, unafraid of those heights
We could sail across the ocean
Winter, summer, any season
You can kiss me on the mountain top
Don't ask me for a reason
Just like kites, unafraid of those heights

No, 'cause sooner or later

I just want a bigger wow
I'm not complaining
If you throw me up, I won't come down
Just say you waiting for me
I'll meet you in the clouds
I just want a bigger wow

Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger (wow)
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger (wow)
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger
Wow

Quit denying, stop pretending
Just admit it that you love it
We can light up all of Vegas
And we never will unplug it
Tonight, unafraid of those heights

No, 'cause sooner or later

I just want a bigger wow
I'm not complaining
If you throw me up, I won't come down
Just say you waiting for me
I'll meet you in the clouds
I just want a bigger wow

Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger (wow)
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger (wow)
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger
Wow

You can tell me all the reasons
Why we shouldn't be together
And spin me til I fall down
Say that this will last forever
Come on, now

I just want a bigger wow
I'm not complaining
If you throw me up, I won't come down
Just say you waiting for me (bigger wow, bigger wow)
I'll meet you in the clouds
I just want a bigger wow

Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger wow
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger)
A bigger wow
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na)
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na)
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na)
Bi-bi-bi-bi-bigger
Wow
