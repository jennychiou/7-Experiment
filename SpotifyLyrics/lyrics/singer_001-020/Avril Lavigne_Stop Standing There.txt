All this talking to you
I don't know what I'm to do
I don't know where you stand
What's inside of your head

All this thinking of you
Is that what you're doing too
You're always on my mind
I talk about you all of the time

Don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
So open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I could show you who I am

You're just standing by
You're just wasting time
Why don't you just tell me the truth
About me and you
And as the time goes by
I hope you realize
If you ask me to
I just might be with you

So don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I could show you who I am

Stop Standing there... standing there
And stop acting like you don't care
And stop being scared... being scared
Stop acting like you don't care

So, don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
So open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I could show you who I am

So, don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I could show you who I am

Who I am, who I am, who I am
