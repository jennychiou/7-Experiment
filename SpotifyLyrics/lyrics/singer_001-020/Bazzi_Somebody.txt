Yeah
Oh, wait

Abusing all my authority
Shutting down these sororities
Music is the priority
All the other shit is a minority
Superman, they can't stop me now
Bad vibes, I just block them out
Michigan where I was poppin' out
Now I'm in the Hills and I'm poppin' now
I can't take my eyes
Take them off this life
Oh, yeah
My paradigm is to feel alive

If you ever turn your back on me
I'ma turn this thing into a tragedy
And I don't want to end this shit tragically
But I know things ain't what they tend to be
And I want to feel your energy
I don't want to turn you to an enemy, but

We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real
We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real

I got somethin' to focus on
They see diamonds, they focus gone
20 years and I'm more than strong
I'm in this thing 'til my pulse is done
Feelin' after like novacane
I feel the sun, I don't see the rain
Found myself and the game was changed
No more sleep and I'm wide awake

If you ever turn your back on me
I'ma turn this thing into a tragedy
And I don't want to end this shit tragically
But I know things ain't what they tend to be
And I want to feel your energy
I don't want to turn you to an enemy, but

We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real
We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real

We all want to be, we all want to be
Somebody
We all want to be, we all want to be
Somebody
