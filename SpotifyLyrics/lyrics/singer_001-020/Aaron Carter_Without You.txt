I've been around on this journey
And I'm learnin' as the world keeps turnin'
You gotta face the fight just to live the dream
Who could have believed
That what I've achieved
Tourin' the globe and all those fine memories
Who would have ever guessed it
Would be like that
(Come on)

But through it all
Who's been there for me
To care with me
Even shed a tear for me
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)

Looking back where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hear me out now)

No matter where this
Road may lead me
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(No me, come on)

It's a dream that
I've come so far
The ups and downs were there
But I worked so hard
Many people don't know the life I live
Always on the road
Always plannin' a show
Gettin' down to business
In the studio
I can face the day
'Cause the love you give
Through it all
When the day is done
And the nights begun
You're still my number one

You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)

Looking back where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hear me out now)

No matter where this
Road may lead me
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(No me, come on)

One shout to my family
'Cause when things get hard
They understand me

Two shouts to my boys at home
Although I'm not there
You know you're not alone

Three shouts to my label
'Cause without them I would not be able
To make the fourth shoutout
The ones I think about
The masterpeice to the masterplan
That's you the fans

Looking back where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hear me out now)

No matter where this
Road may lead me
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me

Looking back

Looking back where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be
Where would I be today

No matter where the
Strong may lead me
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
Plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me

Be no me
