Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

You pick up all of the pieces and put 'em back again
You stitch and sew my heart up all by hand, yeah
I know a good thing when I see one, yeah
And you know I didn't see this coming

So, baby, let's go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
From the minute that you asked me what's my name
I know it's a dangerous game
But love me insane

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane

Taking all my clothes off and jumping in, yeah
This time I'm going all out, sink or swim, oh
I know an angel when I see one
I've been stuck with way too many demons, oh

So, baby, let's go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
From the minute that you asked me what's my name
I know it's a dangerous game
But love me insane

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane

And if I fall now, will you catch me?
And if I fall now, will you catch me?
'Cause I can't do this on my own

So, baby, let's go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
(Lo-lo-love me insane)
So, baby, let's go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
(Lo-lo-love me insane)
