I woke up and saw the sun today
You came by without a warning
You put a smile on my face
I want that for every morning

What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing,
Then I already know

I'm fallin' fast
I hope this lasts
I'm fallin' hard for you
I say, let's take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm fallin' fast
I'm fallin' fast

Doesn't matter what we do
You make everything seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs a sea of lighters

What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing,
Then I already know

I'm fallin' fast 
God, I hope this lasts 
'Cause I'm fallin' hard for you
I say, let's take a chance
Take it while we can
'Cause I know you feel it too
I'm fallin' fast
I'm fallin' fast

I hope you know I hope it lasts
I'm fallin' hard, I'm fallin' fast
We can go, no holdin' back

I hope you know, I hope it lasts
I'm fallin' hard, I'm fallin' fast
For you
We can go, no holding back

I'm fallin' fast
I hope this lasts
I'm fallin' hard for you
I say, let's take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm fallin' fast
I'm fallin' fast
