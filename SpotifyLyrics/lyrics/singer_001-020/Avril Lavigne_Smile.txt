You know that I'm a crazy bitch, I do what I want, when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control, but you don't really give a shit
You go with it, go with it, go with it
'Cause you're fuckin' crazy rock 'n roll

You said "hey, what's your name?"
It took one look and now we're not the same
Yeah, you said hey, and since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame, yeah

And that's why I smile, it's been a while
Since every day and everything has felt this right
And now you turned it all around
And suddenly you're all I need the reason why I smile

Last night I blacked out, I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember making out and then, I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name is on me and my name is on you I would do it all over again

You said "hey, what's your name?"
It took one look and now we're not the same
Yeah, you said hey, and since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame, yeah

And that's why I smile, it's been a while
Since every day and everything has felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need the reason why I smile

You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want
When I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want
When I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

And that's why I smile, it's been a while
Since every day and everything has felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need the reason why I smile
