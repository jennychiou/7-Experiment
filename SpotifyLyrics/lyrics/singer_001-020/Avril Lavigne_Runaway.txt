Got up on the wrong side of life today, yeah
Crashed the car and I'm gonna be really late
My phone doesn't work 'cause it's out of range
Looks like it's just one of those kind of days

You can't kick me down, I'm already on the ground
No you can't, but you couldn't catch me anyhow
Blue skies, but the sun isn't coming out, no
Today it's like I'm under a heavy cloud

And I feel so alive
I can't help myself
Don't you realize

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and run away, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and run away, yeah

So-so's how I'm doing, if you're wondering
I'm in a fight with the world but I'm winning
Stay there, come closer, it's at your own risk
Yeah, you know how it is, life can be a bitch

And I feel so alive
I can't help myself
Don't you realize

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and run away, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and run away, yeah

Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run run away

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and run away, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and run away, yeah

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and run away, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and run away, yeah
