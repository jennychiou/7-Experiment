String of lights, lonely street
A cold rain under my feet
It's all a blur like me and you
Everywhere I look a reflection of blue

I feel my strength is slipping away
Impatience is laying me waste
But today
My only chance is digging in deep
I don't want to be too weak
To stay

I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer
I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer

One goodbye is not enough
To kill the heart of a real love
Giving up and breaking down
Would only prove who's the coward now

I feel my strength is slipping away
Impatience is laying me waste
But today

I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer
I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer

Every muscle in my body ache
I don't hear a single word I say
And I'm starting to break, starting to break, no wonder
And if I don't let it wear me down
We might find a way to work this out
If my love hangs around a little longer

I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer
I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer
I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer
I need the stamina to hold on
Gotta be stronger a little longer
