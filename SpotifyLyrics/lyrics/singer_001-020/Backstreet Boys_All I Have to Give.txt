I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Oh, to you

Hey girl "(Hey girl)"
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Ohh, all the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I love you, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Ohh, everything I have is for you
You got what I need (You, you, you, you...)
What I need
My love is all that I have to give
All that I have is for you
My love is all...

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live "(I don't think that I can live)"
I wish I could give the world to you "(I wanna give the world to you)"
But love is all I have to give "(It's all that I have)"

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
To you

Ohh...
All I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you, lady
But love is all I have to give "(That's all I got to give)"

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live "(I don't think that I can live)"
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
