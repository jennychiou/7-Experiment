Hey

Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay) 
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na

He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
(But I can't without you)
I'm doin' forever in a minute
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh na-na

Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn

Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam (jam)

Get to diggin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
