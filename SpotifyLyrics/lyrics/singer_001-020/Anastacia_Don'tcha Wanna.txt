If you had the chance, I know you surely would
At any time I want it, baby, I could
Said, you'd never saw it coming, did you, dear?
But you can run from everything you fear

Hey, don't you wanna fall in love?

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love with me?
(Baby, you and I)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love?
(Why don't you push your precious pride aside?)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love with me?
(Oh yeah, don't you wanna?)
('Cause you can't let your whole life pass you by)

Sure that you ain't had nothing like this before
You can be the same if I give anymore
I don't wanna waste none of your precious time
But you won't have no choice but to be mine

Baby, don't you wanna live on a line?

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love with me?
(Don't you wanna?)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love?
(Yeah oh, don't you wanna fall in love, yeah?)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love with me?
(Yeah, 'cause you can't let your whole life pass you by, oh)

You can't put nothing before your pride
Oh, I said nothing, nothing
But baby, what I give you can lay your pride aside

Baby, don't you wanna fall in love with me?
'Cause you could take it all night
And I make you see
(Fall in love with me)
Baby, let me know, don't you wanna fall?
Don't you wanna fall?

Baby, don't you wanna fall in love with me?
'Cause you could take it all night
(Yeah, yeah)
And I make you see
Baby, let me know, don't you wanna fall?
(Don't you wanna fall in love?)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love with me?
(I said, "Fall in love with me")

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love?
(Don't you wanna, don't you wanna?)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love with me?
(Fall in love with me, I wanna fall, I wanna fall)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love with me?
(Oh)
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love?
(Yeah, yeah)

Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love?
