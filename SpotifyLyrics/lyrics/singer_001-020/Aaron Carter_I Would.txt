See you walking down the street
Every single day
Girl you never seem to have a smile on your face
What you need is someone who would treat you right
From the morn' till the noon, the noon till the night
Ain't no doubt about what I would do
I'd make a long list
I think you'd approve
You gotta think big
If you wanna succeed

I've got plans girl
It's you and me
Yo, ever since we met
Way back in the day
I'm thinking how to put it
Girl, what can I say
To make you understand how far I'd go
For your heart girl, I just want you to know

That I'd do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
To the max, to the ends of the Earth
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
Givin' all I could
You know that I would

Like Evil Kenevil
Jumps a cannon like an eagle I'll be your super hero
Protect you from evil
Like batman, spiderman, superman
I can be a man
Be my Jane, I'll be Tarzan
Romeo for Juliet
She'll never have another
Scully and Mulder
They were made for each other

Babe Ruth and his bat
Tiger Woods and Nike hat
Can't you see, girl
That we go together like that
One thing I'd like to mention
I'd give ya every second
Of my full attention
I'd give all of this
Ya know that I could
So gimme one chance
To say - I would

I'll do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
To the max, to the ends of the Earth
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
Givin' all I could
You know that I would

Ya see, I wanna create
This kind of magical kingdom
With you as Queen
And your friends - you can bring em
The law of the land
Is ya always gotta party
So hop on my dirtbike
And let's get started
To a fairy tale land
A fairy tale castle
You be my Baywatch Girl
I'll be your David Hassel-off
Nah, we'll always keep it on
It's a double A
R-O-N singing you this song

I'll do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
To the max, to the ends of the Earth
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
Givin' all I could
You know that I would
