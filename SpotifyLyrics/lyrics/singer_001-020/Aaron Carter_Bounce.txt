Welcome to the party

Don't know if you can take it
So now we're gonna shake
And if you can't
Getcha under house arrest

It's like this
We've got a crazy notion
The DJ's treating us with jumpin' potion
So come on everybody
Throw your hands in the air
We'll give it uno dos tres, oh yeah

You gotta get up
To get it down
(Come on, come on)
When the beat kicks
In and you feel the swing
You just won't stand around

Get ready to jump
Gonna funk around
(Come on, come on)
When you feel the swing
Let the fun begin
Don't stop now 'cause I wanna see ya bounce

Livin' it up 'cause we're here to party
With a bouncy bouncy gonna make you happy
Playin' the disco bongo with me
And a bouncy bouncy
Come and dance with me
(Everybody bounce)

Stop the tracks
Can't you see it's not enough
Gotta find the blister and he's comin' on tough
They say turn it down
What'd ya say? No way
The sounds are pumpin'
From the jigga DJ

Crank it up
'Cause we're going super sonic
Generation of millennium
We're gonna rock it
So come everybody
Throw your hands in the air
We'll give it uno dos tres, oh yeah
