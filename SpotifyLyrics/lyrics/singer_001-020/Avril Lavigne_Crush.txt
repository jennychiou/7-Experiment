<You make me lose control, your fingers on my bones
I'm slippin' through the floor, so baby, don't crush me
'Cause there's no exit here, nowhere to disappear
There's not a single tear, so baby, don't crush me

It's just the way you are, the way that you walk
The way that you talk, the way that you read me, baby
And honey, don't hide that look in your eyes
Darlin', it drives me crazy
Don't crush, don't crush me, no, say you'll remain

I'll let you take the wheel, my heart is yours to steal
I know this is real, so baby, don't crush me
The pedal's to the floor and now we're heading north
I've been down this road before, so baby, don't crush me

It's just the way you are, the way that you walk
The way that you talk, the way that you, you read me, baby
And honey, don't hide that look in your eyes
Darlin', it, it drives me crazy
Don't crush (Don't crush)
Don't crush me, no (Don't crush me, no)
Say you'll remain my love

And now that I finally found ya (I just can't live without ya)
You're making me so all about ya (I just can't live without ya)
I don't know what I gotta do if I ain't got you

It's just the way you are, the way that you walk
The way that you talk, the way that you, you read me, baby
And honey, don't hide that look in your eyes
Darlin', it, it drives me crazy
Say you'll remain my love
Don't let my heart break and crush
Don't crush, don't crush me, no
(The way that you walk, the way that you talk
The way that you, you read me baby)
'Cause I've crushed, I've crushed, oh
(And honey, don't hide that look in your eyes
Darlin' it, it drives me crazy)

Don't crush, 'cause I've crushed
Ooh, ooh, ah
