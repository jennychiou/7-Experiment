I'm on air in a turning motion
And I don't wanna take it slow
Take me there use your potion
Tell me how you want this to go

Opportunities knockin' baby come get it, get it, get it
Tell me how you wanna play 'cause I'm wit it, wit it, wit it
Tell me what your plan is put is put me in it, in it, in it
Don't stop the record let it keep spinnin, spinnin, spinnin, spinnin, spinnin

Work my body like a record keep it moving in heavy rotation
Once I get hot, no I don't stop
Watch me like a video press rewind and let it keep playing
And playin' in heavy rotation

Tell the DJ bring it back bring it back
Can you bring it back back back
Tell the DJ bring it back bring it back
Can you bring it back back back

Watch me twist like its contortion
I'm about to get too hot to hold
Boy don't miss come get your portion
Tune me in like your radio

Opportunities knockin' baby come get it, get it, get it
Tell me how you wanna play 'cause I'm wit it, wit it, wit it
Tell me what your plan is put is put me in it, in it, in it
Don't stop the record let it keep spinnin, spinnin, spinnin, spinnin, spinnin

Work my body like a record keep it moving in heavy rotation
Once I get hot, no I don't stop
Watch me like a video press rewind and let it keep playing
And playin' in heavy rotation

Tell the DJ bring it back bring it back
Can you bring it back back back
Tell the DJ bring it back bring it back
Can you bring it back back back

You like to see me move
I know you feel that heat
Don't stop my body
Let it keep Spinnin, spinnin, spinnin, spinnin oh

Work my body like a record keep it moving in heavy rotation
Once I get hot, no I don't stop
Watch me like a video press rewind and let it keep playing
And playin' in heavy rotation

Work my body like a record keep it moving in heavy rotation
Once I get hot, no I don't stop
Watch me like a video press rewind and let it keep playing
And playin' in heavy rotation

Tell the DJ bring it back bring it back
