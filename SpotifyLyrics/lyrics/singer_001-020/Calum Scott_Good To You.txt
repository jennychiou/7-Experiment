If I could go back
To when you were lonely
I'd be there to hold your hand, yeah
Go into our past
'Cause we are the only
People who can understand, yeah

The road that you travelled on, gravel and stone
Has paved every path that I've known

I will be good to you
I know 'cause I've been there before
I will be good to you
I know that it's hard
I will be good to you
Because of my struggle, I swore
That I'd always be good to you
I will be good to you
I know 'cause I've been there before
I will be good to you
Through all of your scars
I will be good to you
Because of my struggle, I swore
That I'd always be good to you

The places you've been
Those places are haunted
But soon you'll be on your way, yeah
You'll never give in
You'll find out what you wanted
I'll be with you night and day, yeah

The road that you travelled on, gravel and stone
Has paved every path that I've known

I will be good to you
I know 'cause I've been there before
I will be good to you
I know that it's hard
I will be good to you
Because of my struggle, I swore
That I'd always be good to you
I will be good to you
I know 'cause I've been there before
I will be good to you
Through all of your scars
I will be good to you
Because of my struggle, I swore
That I'd always be good to you

(Be good to you) Oh, yeah
(Be good to you) Oh, yeah
(I promise to be good to you) Oh I'll be good to you, yeah
(Be good to you) Oh, yeah
(Be good to you) Oh, yeah
(I promise to be good to you) I'll be good to you, yeah
If I could go back
To when you were lonely
I'd be there to hold your hand

I will be good to you
I know 'cause I've been there before
I will be good to you
I know that it's hard
I will be good to you
Because of my struggle, I swore
That I'd always be good to you
I will be good to you
I know 'cause I've been there before
I will be good to you
Through all of your scars
I will be good to you
Because of my struggle, I swore
That I'd always be good to you

Be good to you
I promise to be good to you
Be good to you
I promise to be good to you
Be good to you
