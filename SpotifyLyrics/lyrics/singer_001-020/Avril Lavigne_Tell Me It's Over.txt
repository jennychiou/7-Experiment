I ain't playing no games
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so tired of circular motions
They leave me dizzy and confused
My heart, oh no, is not your revolving door
I get stuck spinning and spinning and spinning
Oh, 'til I collapse on the floor

But every time that you touch me
I forget what we're fighting about
Oh, you come and you leave
Shame on me for believing every word out of your mouth

Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause it don't feel like it's over
Whenever you're closing the door, no
So tell me it's over

Darling, you
Oh, you taste so bittersweet
Can't get you off of my lips
You're dangerous when you take me like a thief

Oh, and I
I should let this go
I try and I try, I try
But why, why won't you leave me alone?

Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause it don't feel like it's over
Whenever you're closing the door, no
So tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause every time you come over
It doesn't feel over no more
So tell me it's over

I keep on leaving the light on
Hoping to find something else, oh
I've played the fool for the last time
I just can't do this myself

Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause it don't feel like it's over
Whenever you're closing the door, no
Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause every time you come over
It doesn't feel over no more
So tell me it's over
