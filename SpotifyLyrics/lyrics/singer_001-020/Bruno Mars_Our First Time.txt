Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby

Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby

Girl here we are,
In this big old empty room
Starin' at each other
Who's gonna make the first move?

Been doin' our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go, is all the way

Is that all right?
Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you, all, night
Don't you worry about a thing, no, no, no

Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Clothes are not required,
For what we got planned
Oh girl, you're my desire
Your wish is my command

Treat you like a princess,
Ooh girl, you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day
Gonna eat you before you melt away

Is that all right?
Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you, all, night
Don't you worry about a thing, no, no, no

Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby

Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby

Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
