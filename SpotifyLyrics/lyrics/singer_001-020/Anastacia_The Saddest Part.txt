My life is always pretending
It's endlessly ending with you
I gave up your shadow
And that is the coldest true
And the secrets we once shared
They turned into "I don't care"
And I know that I will always dream of you


And I already gave you my heart
I said now I, I already gave you my heart
Ooh but you're still so empty
And that is the saddest part

You had me lookin' for something
When there was nothing to find
Ah
And I was so willing
And willing has left me behind
I'm above it all on display
And my scars they been my shame
I love you the best that I could

I already gave you my heart
(Already gave you my heart)
I said now I, I already gave you my heart
Oh you're still so empty
And that is the coldest part

And you know I placed you so far above me
Ooh I placed you too far above me yeah

And I (already gave you)
I already gave you my heart yeah
I said now I, I already gave you my heart
Oh babe
Ooh I, I already gave you my heart
Your love is so damn empty
And that is my saddest part

My life is always pretending
It's endlessly ending with you
