I'm sorry if this hurts you
But I tried to keep what we had once
I was wrong it wasn't keeping me awake
You didn't listen, you didn't listen
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear me
When I said I want more, I got no more
You weren't stealing me away

It's not enough, it's not enough to give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow
Owww
All the memories that were losing
All the time that I spent with you every day
I think is running down the drain
I'm feeling that were fading
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be
It's a lot easier than it seems yeah

It's not enough, it's not enough to give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

And I can feel were falling down slowly, slowly
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now
I can see were burning out
So show me, show me
How you gonna turn it around, because

It's not enough, it's not enough to give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me everything I need
It's not enough, it's not enough to give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up
It's not enough, it's not enough to give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me everything I need
It's not enough, it's not enough to give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me everything I need
Owww hmmm
Owww hmmm
