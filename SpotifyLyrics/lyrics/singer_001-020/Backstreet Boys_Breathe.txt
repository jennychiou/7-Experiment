We're not over

Roses you left me slowly fading to grey
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried

And I never knew alone, wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine
And, no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me,
No, I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe

Ooh, I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings
And someone said hey, we're locking the door, no time to play

And I never knew alone, wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine
And, no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me,
No, I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe

We're not over
We're not over

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't...
You know I can't Breathe

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine
And no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe
(We're not, We're not over)
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe
(Don't say it's over, don't say it's over)
No
