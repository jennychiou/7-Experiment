When everything I know seems to lose me
And people look at me as a child,
I try to find a thought that will save me
For my mind seems to leave me and run wild.
And I run away with my dreams
Yes I run away till the light my eyes can see
Disappears behind the visions of my mind.

When nothing seems to make my life worth living
And every breath I take just means more pain
I think about the times that I've been planning
To bring my thoughts together and explain
I just run away with my dreams
I just run away till the light my eyes can see
Disappears behind the visions of my mind.

In books the men will tell you all their feelings
They'll try to make you feel another life
But when you realize that your feelings
Just make those books a tragic waste of time
You'll just run away with your dreams.
You'll just run away till the light your eyes can see
Disappears behind the visions of your mind.

With your dreams you'll just run away
Till the light your eyes can see
Disappears behind the visions of your mind.
With your dreams, you'll just run away.
