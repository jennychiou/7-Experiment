Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye my love

I can't hide
Can't hide
Can't hide what has come
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go
And leave you alone

But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
Oh

Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye sunshine
Take care of yourself

I have to go, I have to go, I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
Oh
I love you so
Oh

La lullaby, distract me with your eyes
La lullaby, la lullaby, help me sleep tonight
La lullaby
La lullaby
La lullaby
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone

But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
I love you so

Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye my love
