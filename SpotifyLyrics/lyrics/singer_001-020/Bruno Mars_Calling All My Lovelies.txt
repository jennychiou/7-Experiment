I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone

I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be

I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
Oh, look what you're making me do

Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby
Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?
Oh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games
I don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back

I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be

I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
Oh, look what you're making me do

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home
Oh no, look at what you started, baby
Now I'm left here broken hearted, baby
There's a pain in my chest I cannot explain
I told myself I wasn't gon' cry
But somebody's gotta come dry these eyes 'cause

Hi, you've reached Halle Berry
Sorry I can't get to the phone right now
But if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you

Damn

I'm calling calling calling calling all my lovelies
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Oh, since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me, baby)
Look what you're making me do

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home, oh
