Could you keep your head up when you're losing ground?
Could you keep your head up, ooh ooh ooh
Everything you once loved like your own blood comes crumbling down
Could you keep your head up, ooh ooh ooh

Sometimes the tears we cry
Are more than any heart can take
We hurt, just keep it inside
Small wonder that it starts to break

Many moons will light up the way
As sure as night will follow day
And everything you once loved
Remains unbroken, unbroken

Could you find a daydream in the dead of night?
Could you find a daydream, ooh ooh ooh
Keep the quiet victory to a whisper in an uphill fight
Could you keep your head up, ooh ooh ooh

Sometimes the tears we cry
Are more than any heart can take
We hurt, just keep it inside
Small wonder that it starts to break

Many moons will light up the way
As sure as night will follow day
And everything you once loved
Remains unbroken, unbroken

Everything you once loved lies unbroken
Many moons will light us
Many moons will guide us
Everything you once loved lies unbroken
Leave the past behind us
Leave the past behind us

Many moons will light up the way
As sure as night will follow day
And everything you once loved
Remains unbroken, unbroken
