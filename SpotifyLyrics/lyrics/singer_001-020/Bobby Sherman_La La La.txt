La, la, la, la, la, la
There ain't nothing in this world I couldn't do. 
La, la, la, la, la, la
My dreams would all come true if I had you.

I'm just a lonely boy in a great big lonely world
Someone like you could make my dreams come true
Then all the mountains I could climb
If you'd just put your hand in mine
There ain't nothing in the world I couldn't do.

La, la, la, la, la, la
There ain't nothing in this world I couldn't do. 
La, la, la, la, la, la
My dreams would all come true if I had you.

You can make a rainy day sunny in my mind
You make the world seem like a friend to me
Yeah, there ain't nothing I couldn't do 
If you were there to see me through
And I loved you and knew that you loved me
La, la, la, la, la, la
There ain't nothing in this world I couldn't do. 
La, la, la, la, la, la
My dreams would all come true if I had you.

I would feel ten feet tall if you were at my side
Three ain't nothing in this world I couldn't do 
Kings would give up thrones to be
In love for just one hour like me
And that's the way I'd feel if I had you 

La, la, la, la, la, la
There ain't nothing in this world I couldn't do. 
La, la, la, la, la, la
My dreams would all come true if I had you.
