Yeah yeah yeah yeah

There are people who say what you wanna hear
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear
When you really really love someone am I right
When I say that you want them near
And if you care you even tell them things
That they wanna hear

Always for ever
One thing she said
Never say never
The simple lies that she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said she said yeah

There are people
Who say what they really mean
She said she'd always be there
She said she'd always care
But just when you think that you can trust that someone you love
Tell me why do I know that stars can fall from above

Always forever
One thing she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said
Ooh ooh oho yeah
That's what she said
She told me we'd be togethter
That's what she said she said

Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep (ooh)
But you're not hurting yourself
You're only hurting me
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean
Oh how can I make you see just what you did to me

Ooh you said how much you really care
Just when I thought I was in love
Girl how could you care
If I were you I could not lie even once to the face of the one
That I love so much

Always forever
One thing she said
Never say never
Those simple lies she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had.
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we're see forever
That's what she said
Ooh ooh yeah
That's what she said
She told me we'd be together.
Oh that's what she said.
