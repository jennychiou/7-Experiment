Oh, oh, yeah

Oh, get naughty
Get, get, get naughty, ah
Oh, get naughty
Get, get, get

I been working overtime
Chasing papers on the grind
The weekend's here and I am ready to play
(Ready to play)

Hair and makeup, nails done
Slip my freaking dress on
Get overtaking when I step in the place

Let my inhibitions go
When I walk out on the floor
You better act like you know

Don't care what the people say
I'ma do it my way
When I be shaking my thing, ah

Wow

I feel the need to get naughty
Hands all over my body
I don't wanna behave, no

Oh, get naughty
Get, get, get naughty, ah
Oh, get naughty
Get, get, get

I'm a little naughty girl
In this mixed up naughty world
Read you like a book
If you're going judge my cover
(Judge my cover)

Just because I'm having fun
Don't be thinking you're the one
My name ain't Prince
Don't want to be your lover

Let my inhibitions go
When I walk out on the floor
You better act like you know, ah
Don't care what the people say
I'ma do it my way
Shaking my thing

I feel the need to get naughty
Hands all over my body
I don't wanna behave, no, no, no, ah

Oh, get naughty
Get, get, get naughty, ah
Oh, get naughty
Get, get, get

Everybody needs a little time to play
Do what you feel
Don't worry about what people might say

Let yourself go
And lose all control
Give in and let the naughty side of you show
Whoa, oh

Yey, let my inhibitions go, ah
Don't care what the people say, yey
I'm gonna do it my way, my way, my way

(I feel the need to)
Get naughty
Hands all over my body
(I don't want to behave)
No, no

(I feel the need to get)
Naughty
(Hands all over)

My body
(I don't want to behave)
No, no, no

(Oh, get naughty)
Yeah, yey
Get, get, get naughty, ah

Oh, get naughty
Get, get, get
Yey, yey, yey
(Aham, whoo-ow)

(Oh, get naughty)
Come on
(Get, get, get naughty, ah)
Get naughty

(Oh, get naughty)
(Get, get, get)
Whoa, oh, yeah
