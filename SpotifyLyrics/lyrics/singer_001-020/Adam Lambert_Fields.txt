I don't know the reason
Lets just make a choice
Lets throw out the caution
Just one her voice

So walk me through
Back through the fields
When I walked down
That road I find
I already know
On with the show
If there's a god
Then god only knows
Walk me back through
Fields I knew

So when
Like when we believed
A moment in time
When we shined
So walk me through

Back through the fields
Oh take me home
Back to the fields
Erase the dream
Rewrite the scene
If there's a god,
Then god only knows
What we should know
On with the show
