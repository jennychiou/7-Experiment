All you get back
Coming to the stage is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name "Where Yo Stacks At?"
This pretty little thing, I swear won't let you down
Watch her drop it like....hey
Hey

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Yeah, yeah (give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
Money, money, money, make her smile
Yeah, yeah (give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
Money, money, money, make her smile

She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church when dollars fall
Watch her drop it like....hey
Hey

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Yeah, yeah (give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
Money, money, money, make her smile
Yeah, yeah (give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
Money, money, money, make her smile

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Watch her

(Give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
(Got, got, got)
(Give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
(Got, got, got)

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Yeah, yeah (give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
Money, money, money, make her smile
Yeah, yeah (give 'em what you got, give 'em, give 'em what you got)
Money, money, money, make her smile
