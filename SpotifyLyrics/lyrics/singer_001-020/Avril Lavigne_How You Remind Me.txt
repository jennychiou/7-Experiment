Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick inside without a sense of feeling

This is how you remind me
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head scream
"Are we having fun yet?"
"Are we having fun yet?"

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
This is how you remind me (You remind me)
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you, to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head scream
"Are we having fun yet?"

This is how you remind me (You remind me)
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you, to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head scream
"Are we having fun yet?"
"Are we having fun yet?"
