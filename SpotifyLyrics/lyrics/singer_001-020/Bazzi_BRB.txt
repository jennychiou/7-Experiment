Reveal the secrets of your body
You feel perfect when you on me now
I don't want to leave you now
Morning, we saw the night turn into morning
Guess I gotta go right now
Ten more minutes turn into an hour
Yeah

Wish I could stop the hands of time
And lay right here for life

Tell the truth
They can't love you like I do
And we both know that
So wait until I'm back
Yeah
Overtime
I've been working overtime
And when I'm done with that
I'ma be right back
Back, back, back

Moment, I don't wanna waste this moment
Lose myself when I'm inside of you
I might wife you, I might make that move
When we laying here
Tight up in these sheets
Look me in the eyes
Say it's everything you need
Girl, it's true
We can, we can rendezvous
Sex up on the beach in Malibu

Wish I could stop the hands of time
And lay right here for life

Tell the truth
They can't love you like I do
And we both know that
So wait until I'm back
Yeah
Overtime
I've been working overtime
And when I'm done with that
I'ma be right back
Back, back, back

Tell the truth
They can't fuck you like I do
And we both know that
So I'ma be right back
Back, back, back
