And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this

Hit it, Aaron's in the house
Come on get up get up
I wanna make it bounce
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
Aaron's in the house

Yo guys, check it out
Guess what happened to me
Another crazy story, come on AC
I was hanging at the court
Just playing some ball

Working on my game
Yeah, we heard it all
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me

But then I saw a shadow
It was 12 foot 3
It was Shaquile O'Neal
(What? What did he say?)

(How 'bout some one-on-one)
(Do you wanna play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad try not to cry

Please Aaron, are you for real?
One-on-one with Shaquile O'Neal?
Yeah, 34 Center from the L.A. Lakers
You must've been nervous I knew I could take him

Stared' at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes

It's like boom, I put it in the hoop, like slam
I heard the crowd screaming, out jam
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

Boom, I put it in the hoop, like slam
I heard the crowd screaming, out jam
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
So check it out

I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks
Was he hitting those shots?
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop

I had a plan, that I could change the pace
I said, "Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace"
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all

A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess your getting nervous
'Cause you already lost

It's like boom, I put it in the hoop, like slam
I heard the crowd screaming, out jam
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

Boom, I put it in the hoop, like slam
I heard the crowd screaming, out jam
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man

Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man

Announcers were shocked, couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up I put him in shame

I must admit that it sounds real crazy
But the ball went in then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too and we can still be friends

The fans went nuts they put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's
(Get up for school, you're gonna be late)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing a game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)

Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with the name O'neal?

Boom, I put it in the hoop, like slam
I heard the crowd screaming, out jam
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

Boom, I put it in the hoop, like slam
I heard the crowd screaming, out jam
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
