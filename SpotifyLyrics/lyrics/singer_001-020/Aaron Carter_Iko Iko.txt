My Grandma and your Grandma
Sittin' by the fire
My Grandma said to your Grandma
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire"

Talkin' 'bout...
Hey now! Hey now!
"Iko, Iko, unday
Jockamo feeno ai nan'
Jockamo fee nan"'

Look at my king all dressed in red
"Iko, Iko, unday"
Betcha five dollars or he'll kill you dead
"Jockamo fee nan"'


My flag boy and your flag boy
Sittin' by the fire
My flag boy said to your flag boy
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire"


"Jockamo fee nan'
Iko!"


See that guy all dressed in green
"Iko, Iko, unday"
He's not a man, he's a lovin' machine
"Jockamo fee nan"'
