Hey, I think you got my number
When I was out with my brother
You said 'hi' and I think I liked you
Oh we talked about maybe getting together
A raincheck on the weather
Cloudy skies and I had to get home
Oh those eyes
I thought you were a really nice guy
I thought you were just my type
But I forgot your name

I'm a blonde so excuse me
I'm a blonde I get crazy
And everybody knows
We're a little more than fun
I like to play it up like I'm dumb
D-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
'Cause I'm a blonde

Hey I'm not a college grad yet
There are some books I haven't read yet
But I could quote
A little bit of shakespeare in my sleep
But there have been those times
When I've clearly forgotten
How to spell words like R-E-E-D-I-N-G
Me, me and myself
And I try really hard to get by
With simple little things

I'm a blonde so excuse me
I'm a blonde I get crazy
And everybody knows
We're a little more than fun
I like to play it up like I'm dumb
D-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
'Cause I'm a blonde

Oh oh ooh (I-I'm a blonde)
Oh oh ooh (I-I'm a blonde)
Oh oh ooh 'cause I'm a blonde
Maybe if I cared enough to dye my hair
Then you'd take me serious
Maybe I could try to change up their minds
So they take me serious
Ooh so they know
Everybody knows that I'm not dumb
D-dumb, dumb, dumb

I'm a blonde so excuse me
I'm a blonde I get crazy
And everybody knows
We're a little more than fun
I like to play it up like I'm dumb
D-dumb, dumb, dumb
D-dumb, dumb, dumb
D-dumb, dumb, dumb
'Cause I'm a blonde

Oh oh ooh (I-I'm a blonde)
Oh oh ooh (I-I'm a blonde)
Oh oh ooh (I-I'm a blonde)
