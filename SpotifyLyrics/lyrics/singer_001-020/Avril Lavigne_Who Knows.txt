Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Why do you look so familiar? 
I could swear that I have seen your face before 
I think I like that you seem sincere 
I think I'd like to get to know you a little bit more 

I think there's something more 
Life's worth living for 

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughing 
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day 
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day 

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

How do you always have an opinion?
And how do you always find the best way to compromise?
We don't need to have a reason 
We don't need anything, we're just wasting time 

I think there's something more 
Life's worth living for 

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughing 
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughing 
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Find yourself, 'cause I can't find you 
Be yourself, who are you? 
Find yourself, 'cause I can't find you 
Be yourself, who are you? 

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughing 
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day

So you go and make it happen 
Do your best, just keep on laughing 
I'm telling you, there's always a brand new day 

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughing 
One thing's true: there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day
