When you're out I don't know what to do
I do not think that I can wait
To go over and to talk to you
I do not know what I should say

And I walk out in silence
That's when I start to realize
What you bring to my life
Damn, this guy can make me cry

It's so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high all the time

They all say that you're no good for me
But I'm too close to turn around
I'll show them, they don't know anything
I think I got you figured out so

And I walk out in silence
That's when I start to realize
What you bring to my life
Damn, this guy can make me smile

It's so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high

I'll give you everything
I'll treat you right
If you just give me a chance
I can prove I'm right

It's so contagious (Hey, hey!)
I cannot get it out of my mind (Out of my mind!)
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high

It's so contagious (Hey, hey!)
I cannot get it out of my mind (Out of my mind!)
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high all the time
