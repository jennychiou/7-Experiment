You walked in the room
And time was standin' still
Knew you were my destiny
By the way you made me feel
Only you in my life
Forever and today
You're everything I ever imagined
My love could be
You for me

Like the stars need the sky
And the river needs its rain
Like an eagle needs its wings
And the fire needs its flames
Like the sun needs the day
And the night needs the moon
Like the air that I breathe
That's how I...
Dreamed of you
I dreamed you

It's hard to explain
But when you know, you know
I was so amazed by you
You had me at "Hello"
I need you in my heart
My body, mind and soul
It only took a moment to take my breath away
Will you stay?

Like the stars need the sky
And the river needs its rain
Like an eagle needs its wings
And the fire needs its flames
Like the sun needs the day
And the night needs the moon
Like the air that I breathe
That's how I...
I dreamed of you (and I)

Our love can't be denied, no no
There's nothing I can do, nothing I can say
My heart always knew
That's how I dreamed of you

Stars needs sky
River needs rain
Like an eagle needs its wings
And the fire needs its flames
Like the sun needs the day, yeah
And the night needs the moon
Like the air that I breathe
That's how I need you

Like the stars, sky
River and rain
Like an eagle needs its wings
And the fire needs its flames
Like the sun it needs the day
And the night needs the moon
Like the air that I breathe
That's how I need you
Like the air that I breathe
That's how I... 
Dreamed of you
I dreamed of you
Yeah
Yes I did
Oh baby
