Ooh, oh, oh 
She wakes up with the sun
(The sun)
She throws on her clothes
(Her clothes)
Hoping her car will start 
The second time around 
The day has begun
(Begun)
The lines out the door
(The door)
Serving up fraps 
Until she can't take anymore

I see it in her broken smile
Oh, I wish I could tell her 

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

No, she never looks my way 
She never, never, ever looks my way 
She ties up her hair
(Her hair)
Her makeup is smeared 
(Is smeared)
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain 
I hear every word
Why don't you know? 
How beautiful you are 

Just see it in my broken smile
Oh, I wish I could tell her

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

If I could be the light
To guide you through 
The darkness baby
If I could be the one 
To change the ending to your story 

I'd be one in a million, yeah
I'd be one in a million 
Someday I will tell her
You're gonna work it out someday

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way
