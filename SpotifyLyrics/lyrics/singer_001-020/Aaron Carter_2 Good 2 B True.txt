Gonna make a connection
'Cause I know I got take 'em up high
And I'll show you how to whip up a kicker
If that's all right
Got the way you're
Ridin' the half pipe
There's something 'bout
The look in your eyes
Hey girl I know you can show
Me a trick or two
And let it fly

Gonna twist down
Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along
Gonna get it along fine
I got the skills
If you got the style
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
Take people home
To a hip hop beat
Knock me down
Knock me off my feet
Whip one up
Let's get on the with the show
Ooh, yeah the way to go

It's to good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's to good to be true


Okay, it's not like
I'm short of a girlfriend
(Yeah right)

But I'm playing with
My plan of attack
'Cause I know that once she's
Checked out my lip-slide I
Ain't lookin' back

Gonna twist down
Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along
Gonna get it along fine
I got the skills
If you got the style
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
Take people home
To a hip hop beat
Knock me down
Knock me off my feet
Whip one up
Let's get on the with the show
Ooh, yeah the way to go

It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's 2 good to be true

I ride all day
Even in the sun, boilin' hot
But I still have fun
Everybody's watchin'
Keepin' an eye on
How I skate, how I fly
Ridin' the rails
Hittin' the ramps
I'll skate all day
Gonna have to camp
Although I get tired
It doesn't stop me
Hey, you better watch me

Gonna twist down
Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along
Gonna get it along fine
I got the skills
If you got the style
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
Take people home
To a hip hop beat
Knock me down
Knock me off my feet
Whip one up and
Get on the with the show
Ooh, yeah the wat to go

It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true

It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true



And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
