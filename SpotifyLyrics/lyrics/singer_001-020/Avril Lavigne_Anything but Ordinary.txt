Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep
It's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast
Just to feel the danger
I want to scream
It makes me feel alive

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please

To walk within the lines
Would make my life so boring
I want to know that 
I have been to the extreme
So knock me off my feet
Come on, now, give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please

Let down your defenses
Use no common sense
If you look you will see that this world is 
A beautiful, accident, turbulent
Succulent, opulent, permanent, no way
I want to taste it 
I don't want to waste it away

Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep
It's my lullaby

Is it enough? Is it enough?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please

Is it enough?
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
