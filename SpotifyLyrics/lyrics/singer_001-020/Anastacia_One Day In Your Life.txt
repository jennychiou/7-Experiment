I know 
That's just the way it goes
And you ain't right 
For sure 
You turned your back on love
For the last time 
It won't take much longer now
Time makes me stronger
Well, there's nothing more to say 

One day in your life
Said, love will remind you
How could you leave it all behind?
One day in your life 
It's gonna find you 
With the tears you let me cry
And, baby, I'm stronger than before 
You've gotta lay it on the line 
Maybe one day in your life 

My love
Did you think I'd break down
And cry?
This thing we had
It meant the world to me
Guess I was blind
It won't take much longer now
See, time makes me stronger, well
And I know you'll be coming 'round some day

One day in your life
Said love will remind you
How could you leave it all behind?
One day in your life (yeah)
It's gonna find you 
With the tears you let me cry
And, baby, I'm stronger than before 
You gotta lay it on the line 
Maybe one day in your life 

You call me in the midnight hour
With your velvet lines 
So many sleepless nights
I wonder, is it time to say goodbye? 
Ooh, yeah 

One day in your life 
Said love will remind you
Baby, how could you leave it all behind?
Could you leave it all behind? 
Yeah 
One day in your life
It's gonna find you 
With the tears you let me cry
And, baby, I'm stronger than before 
You gotta lay it on the line
Maybe one day in your life 

One day 
One day in your life
Said, love will remind you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
How could you leave it all behind?
Oh oh oh yeah 
One day in your life
It's gonna find you
With the tears you let me cry
And, baby, I'm stronger than before 
You gotta lay it on the line 
Maybe one day in your life
