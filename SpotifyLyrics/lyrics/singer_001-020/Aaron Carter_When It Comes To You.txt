Oh yeah, oh yeah

6:30, Momma get ya outa bed
Ya email what ya gonna Wear to your girlfriend
You skip your breakfast
Forget your backpack
When you're halfway, and you run back
Your daddy's angel
With a halo
Everybody's lookin' at ya more like J-Lo
But there is so much more to you

So put me to the test
I don't have to guess
What you wanna know, now baby (baby)

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through, no
When it comes to you

Now your middle name is August
But I remember
You were born in November
You lived in Jersey
But your from Ontario
The twin sisters like
To talk in stereo
We've got so much in common
Like jammin' beat with lots of bottom
But there's more we could do

So put me to the test
I don't even have to sweat
What you wanna know now baby hey, hey

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through, no
When it comes to you

Yeah, when it comes to you

I want you to know, baby I've been studyin'
Pullin' all nighters
When I could have been partyin'
I can't fail, it's in the details
Understanding all that which is female
Some guys, they never see what they're missin'
Talkin' about themselves
When they should be listening
I pay attention, things you say to me
When it comes to you
It's in my memory

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through, no

When it comes to you, hey
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What chaa ppputting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through, no
When it comes to you

When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
