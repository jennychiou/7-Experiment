Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own
Why do you have to leave me
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
Hold on, onto me
Now I see
Now I see

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La di da di da
It's okay

It feels like nothing really matters anymore
When you're gone
I can't breathe
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
This can't be happening
Now I see
(Now I see)
Now I see

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La da la da la
It's okay
La la la la la

So many questions so much on my mind
So many answers I can't find
I wish I could turn back the time
I wonder why

Everybody hurts some days
(Some days)
Everybody hurts some days
(Some days)
Everybody hurts some days
(Some days)
It's okay to be afraid
(I'm Afraid)
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La da la da la
It's okay
La la la la la
It's okay

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts some days
(Yeah we all feel pain)
Everybody feels this way but it'll be okay
Can someone take me away to a better place
Everybody feels this way
It's okay

La di da di da
It's okay
La la la la la
It's okay
La di da di da
It's okay
La la la la la
It's okay
