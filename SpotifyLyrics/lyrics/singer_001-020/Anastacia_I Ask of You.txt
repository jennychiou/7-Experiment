Whooo
Your love is like a gentle breeze upon a brand-new day
Your touch and what it does to me, like a flower needs its rain
We are like one of a kind, true love is hard to find
I can't go on another day
Just hear me when I say

I ask of you, would you love me, if nothing else went right?
And I ask of you, would you hold me, forever in your life?
And don't let me fall, 'cause I can only give my all
Here I am
I ask of you

I found the place where I belong, it's right here next to you
And nothing else matters now, with all we've been through
I can't go on, tryin' to deny just what I feel inside
But now before I let go, you gotta let me know

I ask of you, would you love me, if nothing else went right?
I ask of you, would you hold me, forever in your life?
Don't let me fall, 'cause I can only give my all
Here I am
I ask of you
Yes I do
I ask of you
Ooh oh

I never really thought
(I never really thought)
That you'd be all to me
(Tthat you'd be all that really matters to me)
I'd give everything and all I am to you
Oh baby, baby, I know you feel this way too

I ask of you, would you love me, if nothing else went right?
And I ask of you, would you hold me, forever in your life?
And don't let me fall, 'cause I can only give my all
I can't pretend
I ask of you
I ask of you
I ask of you
