You told me
There's no need
To talk it out
'Cause it's too late
To proceed
And slowly
I took your words
And walked away

No looking back
I won't regret, no
I will find my way
I'm broken
But still I have to say

It's all right, OK
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
All right, OK
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return
Our bridge has burnt down
I'm stronger now
All right, OK
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

You played me
Betrayed me
Your love was nothing but a game
Portrait a role
You took control, I
I couldn't help but fall
So deep
But now I see things clearer

It's all right, OK
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
All right, OK
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return
Our bridge has burnt down
I'm stronger now
All right, OK
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

Don't waste you fiction tears on me
Just save them for someone in need
It's way to late
I'm closing the door

It's all right, OK
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
All right, OK
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return
Our bridge has burnt down
I'm stronger now
All right, OK
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

It's all right, OK
All right, OK
We know you
No matter what you say

It's all right, OK
All right, OK
Without you
I won't be sorry
