Oh... Oh...

Life doesn't promise a bed of roses
Or white knights
Fields of emotions I'm trapped in darkness
Why me
Save me
To win this twisted war inside me
Won't justify the pain
Life doesn't promise a bed of roses

Lightening strikes the pages keep on turning
Help me to be strong
I'm floating in a sea of strange believers
Where do I belong?

Oh... Oh...

They paint you a picture of perfect nowhere blue skies
Within every lie there's a web of comfort
For them
Not me
To win this twisted war inside me
Won't justify the pain
They paint you a picture of perfect nowhere

I said now
Lightening strikes the pages keep on turning
Help me to be strong
I'm floating in a sea of strange believers
Where do I belong?

Where do we go from here?
I wish I would disappear
I'm a lonely soul
So far from home

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Lightening strikes the pages keep on turning
Help me, help me
I'm floating in a sea of strange believers
Where do I... I said
Lightening strikes, I said lightening strikes
Floating in a sea of strange believers
Where do I belong?
