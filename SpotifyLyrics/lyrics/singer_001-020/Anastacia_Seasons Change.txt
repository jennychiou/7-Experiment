Cradle the weight of your life
You can survive
What lies before you
It's only a matter of time
Before the night
Turns into day
Oh, it should feel incredible, whoa...
To know you're not alone, uh
Just look in my eyes (just look in my eyes)
Whoa... just look in my eyes

I said now...
Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
Nothing stays the same
It just never ends
And here we go again
One thing
Still remains, uh
Seasons seasons change

C'mon yeah seasons change
C'mon yeah seasons change
C'mon yeah seasons change

Are you scared of today?
Running away
I can see through you
Whoaoah...
It feels like an eternal haze
But it's only a faze
It's all in your mind
Oh, when you feel invisible, uh
Just know you're not alone
(C'mon, c'mon)
Just look in my eyes
(Look in my eyes, huh, look in my eyes)
Just look in my eyes

Happy turns to sad
And sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
I said...
Nothing stays the same
It just never ends
And here we go again
One thing
Still remains, uh
But the seasons seasons change

You can feel the air start to change
When you're walkin' out in the rain
And the colors inside your brain start fading
Till the winter is washed away
And nothing really feels the same
When sunlight's in your eyes
You feel alive

What I really want...
What I really want...
What I really want...
What I really want...
I said, yeah, yeah!
Yeah!

Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
And nothing stays the same
It just never ends
And here we go again
One thing
Still remains
The seasons seasons change

Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
Nothing stays the same
It just never ends
And here we go again
One thing
Still remains
The seasons seasons change

C'mon, c'mon yeah seasons change
C'mon yeah seasons change
C'mon yeah seasons change
The seasons seasons change
Huh seasons change
Yeah seasons change
Whoa

Happy turns to sad
Sometimes life gets bad
Things get rearranged
Nothing stays the same
I said seasons seasons change
It just never ends
Here we go again
One thing
Still remains
Seasons seasons change

(Yeah, c'mon)
Woo!
