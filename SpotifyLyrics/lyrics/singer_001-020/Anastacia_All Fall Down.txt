No one's born in this world without a soul
Some will follow every single road trying to find a home
But when you're sheltered by the ones you love
You can stand protected from harm

In your life don't ever let me fall
'Cause sometimes I think I'm falling, like a burning satellite
You Sacrifice, it doesn't matter who you are
We all fall down

We were moving slowly pass the point of no return
Silence is a deadly poison when you have no words
And we can but the pieces back together
Find a way to make things right (yeah yeah)

In your life don't ever let me fall
'Cause sometimes I think I'm falling, like a burning satellite
You Sacrifice, it doesn't matter who you are
We all fall down

Don't stop believing in what you're feeling
We all fall down

But when you're sheltered by the ones you love
You can stand protected from harm

In your life don't ever let me fall
'Cause sometimes I think I'm falling, like a burning satellite
In my eyes you'll always be the shining star
Through the trials and tribulations, I will know that you're the one

In your life don't ever let me fall
