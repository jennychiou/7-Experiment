I'm not alone
Even when we're apart, I feel you in the air, yeah
I'm not afraid
I know what you're thinking, I can hear you everywhere

Some people say it'll never happen
And we're just wasting time
But good things come when you least expect them
So I don't really mind

We'll be together
Come whatever
Not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else can tell us who we are
We'll be together
So don't ever stop
Listening to your heart
'Cause I can't turn mine off, whoa

La la la la la la
Oh

I can't pretend
This is a rehearsal for the real thing
Because it's not
And I know we're young
But I can't help feeling what I'm feeling
And I won't stop

Some things were meant to be and will be there
When the time is right
Even though I know that
I swear I wish it was tonight

We'll be together
Come whatever
Not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else can tell us who we are
We'll be together
So don't ever stop
Listening to your heart
'Cause I can't turn mine off

Ooh yeah
I like what's happening to me
Ooh yeah
Nothing else to say, oh
Ooh yeah
Somebody finally got to me
And carried me away

We'll be together
Come whatever
Not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else can tell us who we are

We'll be together
So don't ever stop
Listening to your heart
'Cause I can't turn mine off, whoa oh

Oh
Yeah

We'll be together
Come whatever
Whatever
Whatever
Whatever
Oh oh

I'm not alone
Even when we're apart, I feel you
