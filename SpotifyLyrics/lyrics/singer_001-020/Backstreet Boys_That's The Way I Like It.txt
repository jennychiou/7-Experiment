Hey
(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind?
You keep on doing all the things I like
You got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl, you make me wanna move
It's a price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way I do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
(I like it)
Everybody now
(That's the way I like it)
Everybody come on
(I like it)
Everybody come on
(That's the way I like it)

Oh mystery lady you've got something I like
Tell me you're here to stay
You're dangerous so baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play
Cause that's the way I like it

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way I do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
(I like it)
Everybody now
(That's the way I like it)
Everybody come on
(I like it)
Everybody come on
(That's the way I like it)

Everybody come on
(I like it)
Everybody come on

Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
The way I do it
(Hey)

That's the way that I like it
That is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it
That is the way I like it

That's the way that I like it
(Everybody now)
That is the way I like it
(Everybody now)
That's the way that I like it
(Everybody come on)
That's the way I like it
(Everybody come on)
(That's the way I like it)
(That's the way I like it)
