If you got the time, I'll take it
If you got the vibe, we'll make it
I'll do that, I'll do that

If you wanna dance, let's move it
If you wanna play, let's play it
I'll do that, I'll do that

And I get on up, and I get on down
And I play the fool when I act the clown
You know that I'd do anything for you

If you want the world, you got it
If you want the girl, you got it
I'll do that baby, I'll do that
So much for you
If you want it all, you got it
Can you hear me call? You got it
I'll do that baby, I'll do that
So much for you, so much for you, so much for you

If you got the game, let's win it
If you got the mood, let's bring it
I'll do that, I'll do that

If you got the song, just sing it
If you sing it wrong, just wing it
I'll do that, I'll do that

And you get on up, and you get on down
You make me smile when I wanna frown
You know that I'd do anything for you

If you want the world, you got it
If you want the girl, you got it
I'll do that baby, I'll do that
So much for you
If you want it all, you got it
Can you hear me call? You got it
I'll do that baby, I'll do that
So much for you, so much for you, so much for you

'Cause if you want it
You've gotta have it, own it, feel it and believe it
Go achieve it
And if you know it
You've gotta shout it, scream it, yell it
Won't you show it, don't you blow it

If you want the world, you got it
If you want the girl, you got it
I'll do that baby, I'll do that
So much for you
If you want it all, you got it
Can you hear me call? You got it
I'll do that baby, I'll do that
So much for you, so much for you, so much for you

Oh, so much for you
So much for you

So much for you
Oh, so much for you
So much for you

So much for you (so much for you)
So much for you (so much for you)
So much for you (so much for you)
