Been seeing too much of you lately
And you're starting to get on my nerves
This is exactly what happened last time
And it's not what we deserve
It's a, a waste of my time lately
And I'm running out of words
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to say

That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love, love, love, love

It's really great to be with you
This is how I could spend my life 
But I'm capable of taking care of myself
So if you fuck this up then go take a hike
It's a waste of my time shaking,
I'm not going out to search
If it's really meant to be,
Then you could find a way to say

That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love 
Baby, this is love 

You and me
We can both start over
Just the two of us
We can get a little closer
So follow me
Honestly
And you will see

That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love, love, love, love
