Ooh
Ooh
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

You've got something
So incredible in my eyes
My heart starts pumpin
Whenever you're around
My whole world's upside down
Baby

But I try to get closer
And you always push me away
You tell me it's much too soon
But I just can't help it
I always gotta make a play

Ooh
Ooh
Boys will be boys
(Hey)
Ooh
Ooh
Baby
Boys will be boys

All my senses
Go right into overdrive

Ooh my defenses
Are never gonna hold
Always gotta lose control

An I hear you sayin'
That you think we should wait
And I can't hold on anymore
My body's callin for you
So please don't hesitate

Ooh
Ooh
Boys will be boys
You outta know by now baby
Ooh
Ooh
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

I gotta do what I gotta do baby
Naaa, na na na now
Naaa, na na na now
(Go!)

And I hear you sayin'
That you think we should wait
And I can't hold on anymore
My body's callin for you
So please don't hesitate

Ooh
Ooh
Boys will be boys (boys will be boys)
Ooh
Ooh
Boys will be boys (you outta know by now baby)
Ooh

Boys will be boys (you know I gotta do what I gotta do baby)
