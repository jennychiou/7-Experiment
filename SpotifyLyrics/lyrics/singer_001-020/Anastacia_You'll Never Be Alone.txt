The world is changing
And time is spinning fast
It's so amazing how you came into my life.

I know it seems all hope is gone
I know you feel you can't be strong
And once again the story ends with you and I.

And anytime you feel like you just can't go on
Just hold on to my love
And you'll never be alone.

Hold on
We can make it through the fire
And my love
I'm forever by your side
And you know
If you should ever call my name
I'll be right there
You'll never be alone.

Hopeless to describe
The way I feel for you
No matter how I try
Words would never do.

I looked into your eyes to find
As long as love is alive
There ain't nothing we can't make it through.

Anytime, or if only for a while
Don't worry
Make a wish
I'll be there to see you smile.

Hold on
We can make it through the fire
And my love
I'm forever by your side
And you know
If you should ever call my name
I'll be right there
You'll never be alone.

Through the fire, by your side
I will be there for you so I'm, don't you worry
(And you know, I'll be there)
You'll never be a... alone
Heya heyeaaaah

Hold on
We can make it through the fire
And my love
I'm forever by your side
And you know
If you should ever call my name
I'll be right there.

Oh baby, hold on
Hold on
(We can make it through the fire)
We can make it baby
And my love
Said I'm forever by your side, yeah
(And you know)
If you should ever call my name
Said I'll be, I'll be right there
Oh, oh, ooh
Hold on
Yeah yeah
(We can make it through the fire)
Yeah yeah
Oh no
(My love)
I know, and you know (I'm forever by your side)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(And you know)
(If you should ever call my name)
(I'll be right there)
