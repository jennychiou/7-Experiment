The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby, you were a star
From that point in time
It was always you and I shining
So beautiful
Later out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible

(I can't let it go)
That was unforgettable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situation's unlivable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go
(I can't let it go)

Tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

Oh, you got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can just disrespect
How would you feel if you were in my shoes
Feelin' used with your heart bruised

(I can't let it go)
The situation's critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
'Cause you're so hypocritical

Tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me

You know
It's wrong to treat me cold
I have no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be
Cause girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
And treat me right

So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

Just treat me right
Just treat me right

Say that you want me
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right
