You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

Going through these bottles
Fucking with these models
All the way in Cali
Foot up on the throttle
Focused on the vision
Trying to pay tuition
For the ones I'm missing
Family is a mission
Oh, yeah
Put you on to things you thought were impossible
On and on, me and you, we're unstoppable

You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

Oh, in the dark, who you are is a star
I know your worth
What you believe is what you see
And that's what you deserve
Lift your frequencies
Baby you could be out a magazine
Just believe
Open up your mind
Realize you divine
If you know you shine
The world will see

You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

Yeah, yeah
Fantasy
Yeah
Fantasy
