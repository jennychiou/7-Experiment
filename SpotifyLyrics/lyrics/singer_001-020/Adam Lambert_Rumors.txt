I guess we're in deep, I guess we got higher
You'll never believe what I heard on the wire
I know it ain't right, it's getting so tired
If we put up a fight, we'll be fueling the fire

Oh, cause now all the things that we said and done
Twisted around, turned 'em wrong
Feels like all the love is gone
We lost it
We get stuck up inside our heads
Talk shit till we're walking dead
Talk shit till we're walking dead (dead dead)

Why do we care about the rumors, baby?
Yeah, why do we care about the rumors, baby?
Oh, 'cause I don't need to lie to you
You'll never break my heart
Yeah, you'll find the truth right here in my arms
So can you tell me why do we care about the rumors, baby?

The envy runs deep, the jealousy down low
It's easy to see, but it's harder to let go
We ain't gonna hide (we ain't gonna hide)
We know what they don't know
A hell of a ride, I swear I'll hold you close

Oh, cause now all the things that we said and done
Twisted around, turned 'em wrong
Feels like all the love is gone
We lost it
We get stuck up inside our heads
Talk shit till we're walking dead
Talk shit till we're walking dead (dead dead)

Why do we care about the rumors, baby?
Yeah, why do we care about the rumors, baby?
Oh, 'cause I don't need to lie to you
You'll never break my heart
Yeah, you'll find the truth right here in my arms
So can you tell me why do we care about the rumors, baby?

Try to keep an open heart, try to just let down your guard
Don't, don't care about the rumors, babe

Get out of the gossip game, get out of the haterade
Don't, don't care about, don't care about, don't care about the rumors
(Don't care about, don't care about)
Rumors
Rumors, don't care about the rumors

Why do we care about the rumors, baby?
Yeah, why do we care about the rumors, baby?
Oh, 'cause I don't need to lie to you
You'll never break my heart
Yeah, you'll find the truth right here in my arms
So can you tell me why do we care about the rumors, baby?
