Woke up to the music of your heart
Saying I, I
Caught up in the wishing that it lasts
Saying I, I

Only you ever make me scared
'Cause only you can take me there

So wherever you go, I'm your shadow
Desert to ice flow, I will follow
Wherever you go, I'm your shadow
I'm your shadow

There beneath your body when it wakes
Saying I, I
Hiding under every step you take
Saying I, I

Only you ever make me care
'Cause only you ever made me dare

So wherever you go, I'm your shadow
Desert to ice flow, I will follow
Wherever you go, I'm your shadow
I'm your shadow
I'm your shadow

I know, I know
I know everywhere you move
You stay, you go
You change, I'm bound to you

So wherever you go, I'm your shadow
Desert to ice flow, I will follow
Wherever you go, I'm your shadow

So wherever you go, I'm your shadow
Desert to ice flow, I will follow
Wherever you go, I'm your shadow
I'm your shadow
