Even the lovers makes a mistake sometimes
Like any other
Fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again?

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me
Maybe your faith is gone, but is it?
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again, oh yeah

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand
And open your heart once again

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah it's true
Without you I would fall apart

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah it' true
Without you I would fall apart

Oh...
Oh yeah...
It's true...
