You say that I'm messing with your head
All 'cause I was making out with your friend
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop 'cause I'm having too much fun

You're on your knees
Begging please
Stay with me
But honestly I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good but now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good but now
Whoa, what the hell?

What
What
What
What the hell?

So what if I go out on a million dates?
You never call or listen to me anyway
I rather rage than sit around and wait all day
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play

You're on your knees
Begging please
Stay with me
But honestly I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good but now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good but now
Whoa, what the hell?

You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed

All my life I've been good but now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

All my life I've been good but now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good but now
Whoa, what the hell?
