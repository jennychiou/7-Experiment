How come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered but I don't care
And the people walkin' by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow (oh yeah)
How decidedly my life has changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go.

And I miss your face

Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

No, Oh Baby
This sweet relief
Unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning

I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes (Like the afternoon)
And now I'm running blind (running blind)
And I can't explain (can't explain)
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon
