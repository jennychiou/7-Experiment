I feel the knife at my throat
And it cuts and it burns
Have you no mercy
You laugh as I twist and I turn
Crushing the air in my chest
Till there is no air to breathe
Pray there's a way to escape
But the joke is on me

Show me some hope
Show me some light
'Cause I got nothing left in my tonight
If I don't go
If I say no
Is it the end?
Somebody tell me
Have I just wasted a life time?
Show me some hope
God it's so cold
Throw me a lifeline
It's so cold
It's so cold
Throw me a lifeline

All too familiar
So why are we back here again?
Tell me you know how it feels to be killing a friend
Screaming in silence
There's no way of saving myself
If there's no redemption
I see you in hell

Show me some hope
Show me some light
'Cause I got nothing left in my tonight
If I don't go
If I say no
Is it the end?
Somebody tell me
Have I just wasted a life time?
Show me some hope
God it's so cold
Throw me a lifeline
It's so cold
It's so cold
Throw me a lifeline

Throw me a lifeline
Now you gone and done

If I don't go
If I say no
Is it the end?
Somebody tell me
Have I just wasted a life time?
Show me some hope
God it's so cold
Throw me a lifeline
It's so cold
It's so cold
Throw me a lifeline
A lifeline
A lifeline
A lifeline
