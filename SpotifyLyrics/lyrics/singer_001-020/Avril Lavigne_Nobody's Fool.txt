Step up, step up (Step up)
Step up, step up (Step up)
Step up, step up
Step up

Fall back, take a look at me and you'll see
I'm for real, I feel what only I can feel
And if that don't appeal to you
Let me know and I'll go 'cause I flow
Better when my colors show

And that's the way it has to be.
Honestly, 'cause creativity could never bloom in my room
I'd throw it all away before I'd lie,
So don't call me with the compromise
Hang up the phone I got a backbone stronger than yours.

(Step up) La la...
(Step up) La la...
(Step up) La la...
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see, I'm not down with that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Go ahead and try.

Don't know you think you know me like yourself,
But I fear that you're only telling me what I wanna hear
But do you give a damn?
Understand that I can't not be what I am.

I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon.
It's not a simple here we go not so soon.
I might have fallen for that when I was fourteen
And a little more green,
But it's amazing what a couple of years could mean.

(Step up) La la...
(Step up) La la...
(Step up) La la...
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(I'm not nobodys fool) I'm not nobody's fool.

If you wanna bring me down
Then go ahead and try
Go ahead and try.

Oh...
Go ahead and try
Try to look me in the eye, but you'll never see inside
Until you realize (Realize)

Things are tryin' to settle down
Just try to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it's with or without you I don't need you doubtin' me

If you're tryin' to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryin' to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
(I'm not nobody's fool) I'm not nobody's fool

If you wanna bring me down
Then go ahead and try, try

(Go ahead and try) La la...
(Go ahead and try) La la...
Yeah... Go ahead and try
La la
La la
You'll be laughing out loud
La la
If I'm playin' to my own crowd
La la
La la
Try...
