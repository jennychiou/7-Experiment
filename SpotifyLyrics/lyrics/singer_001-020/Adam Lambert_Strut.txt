I wanna start a revolution
A type of personal solution
We all have got our own pollution
It's all about the execution

You got something to say
Your hands are tied
Open your mouth
Open it wide
Let the freedom begin
Get on the floor
Just let it drop
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel hot
Feel the fire within
I wanna see you strut
Strut strut
Come on walk for me
Strut, strut strut
How you wanna be

Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo
Don't want to be so low, solo, solo
Don't wanna be so low

We're a complicated nation
And now we're in a situation
Let's take a make-believe vacation
And get yourself some validation

You have something to say
Your hands are tied
Open your mouth
Open it wide
Let the freedom begin
Get on the floor
Just let it drop
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel hot
Feel the fire within

I wanna see you strut
Strut strut
Come on walk for me
Strut, strut strut
How you wanna be

Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo
Don't wanna be so low, solo, solo
Don't wanna be so low

I'll be your mirror
Darlin' let your hair down
Show me what you're workin' with
And let me see you strut
Strut strut, strut strut
How you wanna be

Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo
Don't wanna be so low, solo, solo
Don't wanna be so low

Strut for me and show me what you're workin' with
Strut for me and show me what you're workin' with.
