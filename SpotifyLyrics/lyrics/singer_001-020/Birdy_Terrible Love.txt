It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

It's quiet company
It's quiet company

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

It's quiet company
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

And I can't fall asleep without a little help
It takes awhile to settle down
My shivered bones
Wait 'til the panic's out

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

Company
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

But I won't follow you into the rabbit hole
I said I would, but then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
