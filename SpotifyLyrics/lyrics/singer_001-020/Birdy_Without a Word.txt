Hey, you can tell the world
That you're leaving
And you can pack your bags
And spread your wings
And you can tell them all
That it's over
But while you wave goodbye
Oh, I'll be getting closer

Stand there and look into my eyes
And tell me that all we had were lies
Show me that to you it don't count
And I'll stay here if you prefer
Yes, I'll leave you without a word
Without a word

And you can tell the world
That you're tired
But your excuses, they won't work
'Cause I'll know that you're lying
Every time that I see your face
I notice all the suffering
Just turn to my embrace
I won't let you come to nothing

Stand there and look into my eyes
And tell me that all we had were lies
Show me that to you it don't count
And I'll stay here if you prefer
Yes, I'll leave you without a word

Without a word
Without a word
Without a word
Without a word
Without a word
