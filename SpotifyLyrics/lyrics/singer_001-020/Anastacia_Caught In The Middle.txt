We've been rolling like thunder
Ain't been no other
Got my back the way you do babe
And every day it gets stronger
The way that I want you
I can't push it away

And every day I'm trying to find the words, the words to say
But I'm trying not to complicate the games we play
And I don't know how, what way, but things got to change
Now my heart sings out so loud
Boy I need you now
I need you now

Ooh you, you got me caught in the middle
You got me caught in the middle
Between my heart and my head oh
I don't need that
You don't need that
We don't need that

But I'm caught in the middle
Oh yeah I'm caught in the middle
Don't wanna fall out of rhythm
I don't need that
You don't need that
We don't need that

You got the eye of the tiger
An unending fire
And it's calling me home
And every day I'm trying to find the words, the words to say
But I'm trying not to complicate the games we play
And I don't know how, what way, but things got to change
Now my heart sings out so loud
Boy I need you now

Ooh you, you got me caught in the middle
You got me caught in the middle
Between my heart and my head oh
I don't need that
You don't need that
We don't need that

But I'm caught in the middle
Oh yeah I'm caught in the middle
Don't wanna fall out of rhythm
I don't need that
You don't need that
We don't need that

I don't wanna escape
Got me trapped in the love we make
Now I gotta be straight
Ooh
So before it's too late
It's a risk that I wanna take
Tell me do you feel it too

Ooh you, you got me caught in the middle
You got me caught in the middle
Between my heart and my head oh
I don't need that
You don't need that
We don't need that

But I'm caught in the middle
Oh yeah I'm caught in the middle
Don't wanna fall out of rhythm
I don't need that
You don't need that
We don't need that
