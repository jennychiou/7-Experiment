Counting all different ideas driftin' away
Past and present, they don't matter, not if you just sort it out
Watch her moving in elliptical pattern
Think it's not what you say, what you say is way too complicated
For a minute though I couldn't tell how to fall out

It's twenty seconds till the last call
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
And lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it all summer long

And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
It's not a miracle we needed
No, I wouldn't let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Girlfriend, oh, your girlfriend's drifting away
Past and present, 1855,1901
Watch them build up a material tower
Think it's not gonna stay, anyway, I think it's overrated
For a minute though I couldn't tell how to fall out

It's twenty seconds till the last call
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it all summer long

And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
It's not a miracle we needed
No, I wouldn't let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
