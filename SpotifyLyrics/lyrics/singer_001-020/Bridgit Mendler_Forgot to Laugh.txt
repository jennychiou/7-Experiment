When I read your face
It's like a screen door
I can see right through.
Your heart's a window.
Why you gotta treat me like the bimbo
That sticks there out
When you don't care anymore?

You make it so easy
You're sweet like a Reese's Pieces
But I promise, if you leave me
You'll be crawling on your knees
So if you go, it's a joke

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
I forgot to laugh

You don't like it when I check your iPhone (check your iPhone)
I don't even get my own ring tone (ring tone)
When you're heading out with all your best bros (best bros)
You don't wanna tell me where you guys go (guys go)

You say that I'm needed
Like a kid needs Reese's Pieces
But I promise if you leave me
You'll be running back to me
At my door, what a joke

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
I forgot to laugh

So if you're saying, "Peace back,"
You're so over me
Try to sting like a bee
Then I gotta laugh
You're more like a jockey
Or a cute little bunny
Think that you're funny
I forgot to laugh
Laugh

Like a diamond in a mountain of coal
I'm the girl the guys can't find anymore

(Hey, yeah!)

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's good-bye today (good-bye)
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
I forgot to laugh

If you drive away (If you drive away)
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's good-bye today (good-bye)
Know you're leaving here empty-handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, (go-o-o) you're a joke (you're a jo-o-oke)
I forgot to laugh

I forgot to laugh.
