Too young to see tomorrow
Too young to know it hurts
Found love in empty bottles
I guess we'll never learn
So just lay with me, lay with me, late 'til morning
'Cause I'm high and you're high, together we're soarin'

And if I go too hard, pray the Lord my soul to take
I've been up all night, tell tomorrow it can wait
I think we went too far, the ones they couldn't say
Inside you I found faith

I apologize if I say
Anything I do mean
'Cause I've been drinking too much
Faded off the gasoline
I'm just trying to live life
Put on for my family
That's on everything
Girl we can do anything
'Cause baby, we are

Too young to see tomorrow
Too young to know it hurts
Found love in empty bottles
I guess we'll never learn
So just lay with me, lay with me, late 'til morning
'Cause I'm high and you're high, together we're soarin'

And if I go too hard, pray the Lord my soul to take
You're here, I'm here, tell me this isn't fate
You should know you could go anywhere you wanna be
Take my hand to find your fantasy

I apologize if I say
Anything I do mean
'Cause I've been drinking too much
Faded off the gasoline
I'm just trying to live life
Put on for my family
That's on everything
Girl we can do anything
'Cause baby, we are

'Cause baby, we are
Lay with me 'til the morning
'Cause I'm high and you're high, together we're soarin'
