I'll pick my battles 'cause I know I'm gonna win the war (win the war)
I'm not route out 'cause I'd shouted all of this before (this before)
Steadier than steel 'cause I'm ready with my shield and sword (shield and sword)
Back on a subtle 'cause I gotta get on my strength for more

And I won't bow, I won't break
No, I'm not afraid of you whatever it takes
I'll never bow, I'll never break

Cause I'm a warrior
I fight for my life like a soldier
All through the night
And I won't give up, I will survive
I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive
I will conquer, time after time
I'll never falter, I will survive
I'm a warrior

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm a warrior

Like a viking I'll be fighting through the day and night (day and night)
I'll be marching through the darkness to the morning light (morning light)
Even when it's harder like the armor you will see me shine (see me shine)
I won't stop and I won't drop 'till the victory's mine

And I won't bow, I won't break
No, I'm not afraid of you whatever it takes
I'll never bow, I'll never break

Cause I'm a warrior
I fight for my life like a soldier
All through the night
And I won't give up, I will survive
I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive
I will conquer, time after time
I'll never falter, I will survive
I'm a warrior, oh

Oh, you can't shoot me down
You can't stop me now
I got a whole damn army
Oh, they tried to break me down
They tried to take me out
You can't cut a scar on me

I'm a warrior
I fight for my life like a soldier
All through the night
And I won't give up, I will survive
I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive (I am stronger)
I will conquer, time after time (I will conquer)
I'll never falter, I will survive (I'll never falter)
I'm a warrior (I'm a warrior)

Oh, oh, oh
I am a warrior
Oh, oh, oh
I am a warrior
