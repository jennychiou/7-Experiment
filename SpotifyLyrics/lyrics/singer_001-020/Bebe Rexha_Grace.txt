I knew from the moment that I met you, this wasn't right
But I couldn't leave you 'cause you treated me so damn right
There was nothing wrong with you
The truth is you're a damn good guy
But I knew from the moment that I met you, this wasn't right

And you had money and cars, look like a star
You loved me so good, I could cry
Bought me roses and rings, such beautiful things
But I was taught never to lie

I hate to see the look on your face
I wish I could make myself stay
But our hearts don't live in the same space
So tell me how to break yours with grace
(So tell me how to break yours with grace)

I knew from the moment that I left you, you'd be alright
You're gonna find another lover, one who doesn't waste your time
But every time you look at me, my body says, "One last night"
I swear I wouldn't leave with you
But I just came to say goodbye

And you had money and cars, look like a star
You loved me so good, I could cry
Bought me roses and rings, such beautiful things
But I was taught never to lie

I hate to see the look on your face
I wish I could make myself stay
But our hearts don't live in the same space
So tell me how to break yours with grace

I hate to see the look on your face
I wish I could make myself stay
But our hearts don't live in the same space
So tell me how to break yours with grace
(So tell me how to break yours with grace)
