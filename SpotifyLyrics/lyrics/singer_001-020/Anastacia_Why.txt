Count your blessings now
We don't have much time
Here I went and thought that we were doing this together
So don't go silent now

Tell me what you're feeling
Say what's on your mind

Why you
Why me
No one's saved or left behind
When things go bad we can't rewind
We're confused and we can't see
Let's turn the page and start again
Why ask why

Both feet on the ground
And you'll be safe and sound
Seems to me we're living yeah
We're living in a revolution
But we don't need weapons now

'Cause we're already bleeding
Let's take away the pain

Why you
Why me
No one's saved or left behind
When things go bad we can't rewind
We're confused and we can't see
Let's turn the page and start again
Why ask why

I said I said

Why you
Why me
No one's saved or left behind
When things go bad we can't rewind
We're confused and we can't see
Let's turn the page and start again
Why ask why

Why ask why
Oh say why, why
Say why ask why
Oh no no no
We got both feet on the ground
Solid ground, yeah
Why you, why me, why
I wanna live in the world
Yeah
Why you, why me, yeah
Both feet on the ground
And we're safe and sound
It seems the revolution, yeah
We're living in a revolution, yeah
'Cause we're already bleeding
Let's take away the pain
