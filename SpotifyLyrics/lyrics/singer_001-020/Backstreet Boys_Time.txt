I know that I, I can't believe
Just what the past has brought me
To the man I wanna be
And I know that we have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
'Cause we have so far to go
I know we have changed but,
Change can be so good
So let's not forget why it's understood that

Time
Look where we are
And what we've been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams (sharin' little, little life with you)
Time (goes on) goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may

I remember when mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days, that we would sing at
The drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered
Oh, I know we've changed but,
Change can be so good
Oh, so let's not forget why it's understood that

Time
Look where we are
And what we've been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams (sharin' little, little life with you)
Time (goes on) goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may

So here we are
And we'll always stay together
And through it all you know
We owe it all to you, you, you and you
(Time goes on, never stops, it keeps on)

Time
Look where we are
And what we've been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams (sharin' little, little life with you)
Time (goes on) goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may

Time
Look where we are
And what we've been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams (sharin' little, little life with you)
Time (goes on) goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may

Time goes on and on everyday
Time is what it is
Come what may
Come what may...
