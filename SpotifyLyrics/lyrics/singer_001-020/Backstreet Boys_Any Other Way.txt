There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you.
I tell my heart but
I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you.

Now you're carved out a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That its time to accept it's the way things are
I wish I could but...

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.

Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel
It's like I'm living in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real...

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.

Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears, they never hit the ground
Like your still here, your still here

Since you drained all the color out of the sky

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.
