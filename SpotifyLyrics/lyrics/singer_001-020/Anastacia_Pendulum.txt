When a love's so rare
That it strips you bare
And when it leaves, it leaves you undone
So I'll bow my heart
Underneath my scars
Until back swung the pendulum

You and I, were never really you and I
But baby don't apologize, it's alright
You and I, such a damn pretty lie
It's okay to dream a while sometimes

But all I thought about us
It's not about us this time
You and I, were never really you and I
Never really you and I no no

Someone turn the lights out
Turn the lights out on love
But oh love, will survive it
Oh it turns on it's the swing of the pendulum, pendulum
Pendulum, pendulum, pendulum, pendulum...

Different paths, we're just taking different paths
I know that's why it didn't last for us
Symmetry, I still believe that symmetry
Will find a love for you and me, I trust

But all I thought about us
It's not about us this time
You and I, maybe there's a you and I
In a different place, different time, next time

Did someone turn the lights out
Turn the lights out on love
But oh love, will survive it
Oh it turns now it's the swing of the pendulum, pendulum
Pendulum, pendulum, pendulum, pendulum...
