Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada dadadadada
(On memory's bliss of you)
Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada (oh) dadadadada

The candle plays the hour glass days go
And all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile, even all the reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my mind

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny in everything
Reality has replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life
I bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there
Just give me time
To fix my life
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes
After all the time I spent wishing

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind fights carelessly imagine
You are happy with your life right now, oh...
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone
So now I must place you with all the things
That I could never have

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss
Send me, you send me
Come on now
I know this love is true
I know this love is true
