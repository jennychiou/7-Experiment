Darlin', you're hiding in the closet once again
Start smiling
I know you're trying real hard not to turn your head away
Pretty darlin'
Face tomorrow, tomorrow's not yesterday...

Pretty please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Darlin', I was there, once a while ago
I know that it's hard to be stuck with people that you love
When nobody trusts

Pretty please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
That I can
Ooh

And you're not the only one who's been through
I've been there alone and now so are you
I just want you to know, want you to know
It's not your fault, it's not your fault

Your fault, your fault
It's not your fault, your fault, your fault, your fault

Pretty please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can...

Pretty please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
That I can
