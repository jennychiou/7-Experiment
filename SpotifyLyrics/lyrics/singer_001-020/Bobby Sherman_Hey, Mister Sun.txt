When I got up this morning
I said good morning Mr. Sun
I've been looking through the raindrops much too long
I need someone
I can tell you where my mind is at
If you will take the time to listen
'Cause it's such a lovely morning
Won't you walk with me
And talk with me Mr. Sun
I've been running all my life now
In search of something I can't find
I've been chasing rainbows
And they're just visions in my mind
There are a lot of lonely people just like me that need someone
To walk with and talk with sometimes Mr. Sun
Hey Mr. Sun
You can change the night to day
You can chase away the rainbows they're just illusion anyway
When I'm standing in the rain
You can come and be my friend
You can make the storm clouds break
And let the sun shine through again
And tomorrow when I'm dreaming
Of some mountain I will climb
You can tap me on the shoulder
And whisper to me from behind
Please remind me of the yesterdays
I tried it all alone
You can tell me that's it's time again
To walk again
And talk again with you
Mr. Sun
