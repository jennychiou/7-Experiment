What's on your mind?
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout last night
What's the time?
Feels like I've sat here all my life

Your ship rolls in, I'm here waiting
I don't know why, I'm paralysed
Oh, what I'd do to be with you
Oh, what I'd give

To hear you say that 'I love you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that 'I miss you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room

Couldn't work out, why you gave me all those signs
So tell me now, before I lose my mind

Your ship sails in, I am waiting
You stand close by, and watch me cry
Oh, what I'd do to be with you
Oh, what I'd give

To hear you say that 'I love you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that 'I miss you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room

Hold out your hand
Give me a light in the dark
You know that I'm broken
Don't leave me here broken

(Chorus/Outro)
To hear you say that 'I love you'
But hear it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that 'I miss you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
Oh, give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room
