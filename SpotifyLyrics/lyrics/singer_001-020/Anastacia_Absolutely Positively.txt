I've been thinking about it
Give some serious thought
And I made up my mind
And I have decided that I need a little more time to decide

We used to be happy
Loving being in love
But lately I came to find
That everyday there's something new about you that I just don't like
So now I'm

Absolutely positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you yeah anymore

Absolutely positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you yeah anymore

Now I can't deny
There some feelings for you inside of me
That's why I'm having the hardest time
Trying to just up and leave
But every time that you smile in my face
While lying to me
Packin' my things and getting outta here
Suddenly seems so easy
So now I'm

Absolutely positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you anymore

Absolutely positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you yeah anymore

I been racking my brain over you
Trying to figure out just what to do
Don't think I love you anymore

Absolutely positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you anymore

Absolutely positively 
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you yeah anymore
