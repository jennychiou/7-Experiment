God knows what is hiding
In those weak and drunken hearts
I guess he kissed the girls and made them cry
Those hard-faced queens of misadventure

God knows what is hiding
In those weak and sunken eyes
A fiery throngs of muted angels
Giving love but getting nothing back

Oh, people help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

People help the people
And nothing will drag you down

Oh, and if I had a brain
Oh, and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

God knows what is hiding
In this world of little consequence
Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets

God knows what is hiding
In those weak and drunken hearts
I guess the loneliness came knocking
No one needs to be alone, oh, save me

People help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

People help the people
And nothing will drag you down

Oh, and if I had a brain
Oh, and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

People help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it

People help the people
And nothing will drag you down

Oh, and if I had a brain
Oh, and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away
