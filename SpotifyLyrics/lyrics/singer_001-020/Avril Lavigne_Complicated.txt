Uh huh
Life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is

Chill out, what you yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me

Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else 
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break 
And you take what you get and you turn it into 
Honesty, promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You're making me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not foolin' anyone 
When you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me

Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else 
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break 
And you take what you get and you turn it into 
Honesty, promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no...

Chill out, what you yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
