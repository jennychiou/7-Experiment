I'm the type of person to get carried away
Been this way since I came out of the womb
A bit obsessive, got that all for me, yeah
Yeah, and God knows I do not like to lose

And I want your love, I want your love
I'ma do whatever it takes
And I want your love, I want your love
I know I come on hard, there's no need to be alarmed
It's just I'm...

Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all

I never listen to the voice in my head
You know, it's like I got no brakes in my car (I never listen to it)
I'm on a mission, gonna sleep when I'm dead
And it's impossible to stop when I start

And I want your love (I want your love), I want your love
I'ma do whatever it takes (Oh, oh, oh)
And I want your love (I want your love), I want your love
I know I come on hard, there's no need to be alarmed
It's just I'm...

Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all (Oh)
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all

Oh, I'm so passionate

All I want is everything
Too much adrenaline
And all I'll do is anything
But like a gentleman
Singin', all I want is everything
Too much adrenaline
And all I'll do is anything
But like a gentleman

Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it (Oh, oh, oh)
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all (Ooh)

Yeah
No, no
No, no, no, I'm so passionate, oh
To the beat now, to the beat now

Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
(La la la la la la la)
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
(I'm so passionate, yeah)
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
(Come on, yeah, yeah yeah)
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
(I'm so passionate)
