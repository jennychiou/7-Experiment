No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fines"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try? Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

Oh, oh
Oh, ah

I stay up, talkin' to the moon
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in just doesn't feel like home

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

Lookin' for some new friends
Oh, oh
Oh, ah

I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

Oh, oh
Oh, ah
