You say you want the truth, but you can't take it
So I give you lies
I give you lies
You say you want the best, but you destroy it
So I keep it inside
I keep it inside

I tell you something
It's a double-edged sword you're giving
And I can't see the truth in living
When we hide with a wall of fear
And you don't see it
It's a twisted dream you believe in
And what's the use in pretending?
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear

So there I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown-ass man
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadows
So there I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown-ass man
And I don't understand
Why I should be living in the shadows
So there I said it

You wanna hear my voice, my mind, my demons
But not too much
Or you'll give up

I tell you something
It's a double-edged sword you're giving
And I can't see the truth in living
When we hide with a wall of fear
And you don't see it
It's a twisted dream you believe in
And what's the use in pretending?
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear

So there I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown-ass man
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadows
So there I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown-ass man
And I don't understand
Why I should be living in the shadows
So there I said it
