Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say, say what you want, just don't say that you're leaving
I hope this summer breeze will last more than a season
Will you ride to me in time will see
Maybe spent your whole life with me
And we've packed our suitcases, we've shut up all the windows
Hold tight, soon you and I flow anywhere the wind blows
So make life to me, hold tight to me
Stay away the whole night with me

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Could I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Could I meet you here when time is clear?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could runaway, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here

I taste the salt in the air and in your sweater that you're sleeping
I dream about us riding bikes in sunset by the oceans
Those were cutie days, lazy days
Sipping rosé time to waste (sipping rosé time to waste)

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Could I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Could I meet you here when time is clear?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could runaway, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Souve-souvenir
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I leave here you'll coming with me
If you leave here I'm going with you

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Could I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Could I meet you here when time is clear?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could runaway, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here
