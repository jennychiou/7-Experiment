Shot guns and roses
Make a deadly potion
Heartbreak explosions
In reckless motion
Teddy bears and "I'm sorry" letters
Don't seem to make things better
Don't bury me alive
Sweet talk and lullaby

But I can't stop the rush
And I can't give you up
No I, no you're no good for me
You're no good for me

I fell in love with the devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the devil
I'm underneath his spell (Ah)
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the devil
Please, save me from this hell (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Got me playing with fire (playing with fire)
Baby, hand me the lighter (hand me the lighter)
Taste just like danger (taste just like danger)
Chaotic anger (chaotic anger)

But I can't stop the rush
And I can't give you up
No I, no you're no good for me
You're no good for me

I fell in love with the devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the devil
I'm underneath his spell (Ah)
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the devil
Please, save me from this hell (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Angels and devils always fight over me (fight over me)
Take me to heaven, wake me up from this dream
Even in sunlight are crashed out over me
It's now or never, wake me up from this dream

I fell in love with the devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the devil
I'm underneath his spell
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the devil
Please, save me from this hell (this hell)

Take deep, sink, sink, fear (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Take deep, It's killing me
I fell in love with the devil (take deep) (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
And now I'm in trouble (sink, sink, fear) (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I fell in love with the devil (take deep) (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
It's killing me
