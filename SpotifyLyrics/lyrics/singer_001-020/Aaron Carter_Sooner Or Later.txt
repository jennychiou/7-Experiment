These past days and past nights
Walks under streetlights
Something don't feel right

Sooner or later she'll be
Trips to Chicago
Don't call me crazy, this time tomorrow
Could lead me, I'll follow
I've got the tables, I've bought the bottles

Sooner or later she'll
Be walking away, I've got something to say to her
Sooner or later she'll
See what's inside, I've put something away for her
Man, I'd do anything for her
Sooner or later she'll be

She'll be
She'll be
She'll be
Sooner or later she'll be
She'll be
She'll be
She'll be
Sooner or later she'll be

I ain't calling you back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad
Cause sooner or later she'll be
Coming right back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad

Sooner or later, yeah
Sooner or later, yeah

Don't tell me I'm not sure
Don't tell me I'm not yours
Is time moving backwards?
And sooner or later we'll be
Just over oceans
I need your body on me like lotion
Girl's a commotion
Worship your body, call that devotion

Sooner or later she'll
Call me and tell me she's feeling alone tonight
Sooner or later she'll
Text me and tell me that she's leaving on the light
'Cause I'm not going home tonight
Sooner or later she'll be

She'll be
She'll be
She'll be
Sooner or later she'll be
She'll be
She'll be
She'll be
Sooner or later she'll be

I ain't calling you back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad
Cause sooner or later she'll be
Coming right back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad

Sooner or later, yeah
Sooner or later, yeah
