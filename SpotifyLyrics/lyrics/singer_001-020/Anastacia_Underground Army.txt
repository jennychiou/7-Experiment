I'll be a soldier for you,
Protect you and the city surrounding too,
Your underground army will be swarming,
If you just say you want me too,
I'll be a soldier for you

Lost in your still, rolling down hill,
But you cannot see why,
Nothing makes sense when every minute spent,
Is fighting the down slide,
But think of this phase, as running out of days,
And we'll get throught the mean time,
The road is long, forces strong,
But it will be all right

And ill feel better when you feel better and...

I'll be a soldier for you,
Protect you and the city surrounding too,
Your underground army will be swarming,
If you just say you want me too,

I'll be a soldier for you,
Go first in all that you do,
Your underground army will be swarming,
If you just say you want me... too

Can't trust the view, that lense is fooling you,
You see half when there's whole,
So I'll stick around and help you figure out,
These situations come and go,
We've come to an end but there's much to defend,
Just think of what we have known

And ill feel better when you feel better...

I'll be a soldier for you,
Protect you and the city surrounding too,
Your underground army will be swarming,
If you just say you want me too,

I'll be a soldier for you,
Go first in all that you do,
Your underground army will be swarming,
If you just say you want me to

And ill feel better when you feel better too,
I will...

I sed i...
I'll be a soldier for you,
Protect you and the city surrounding too,
Your underground army will be swarming,
If you just say you want me too,

I'll be a soldier for you,
Just say you want me too,
I sed I'll be your soldier,
Your underground army will be swarming,
If you just say you want me...
Too, whoa wo whoa

I said and ill feel better when you feel better... too
