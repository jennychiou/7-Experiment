I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river that could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love that leaves you bodied and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah

I'm not that kind of person who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do

Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I got

Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say and now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pick up all your things and drive away like it's stolen?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open, no no no no, yeah yeah yeah

I'm not that kind of person who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do (what love's supposed to do)
I'm not that kind of person who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do

Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I got
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I got

I've been broken, I've been bruised
But now I'm all in 'cause of you
So if you're gonna love me, love me right, yeah
But if you're gonna be someone that hurts somebody just for fun
Then do it to a heart that isn't mine

Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I got
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I got
It's the only one, it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I got
Baby don't go...
