Everyday, girl I wake up and pray
That you'll come back home and don't take too long
'Cause since you've been gone, everything's gone horribly wrong
I wish you were here, holding me near
You know I'd go out of my mind if you ever left my heart behind
So I'm begging you please bring your sweet love back to me
(Please come back to me)

If I don't have you (don't have you)
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I can't go on in this world alone
Baby its true (baby its true, if I don't have you)
If you said goodbye (u said goodbye)
Girl I would die (girl I would die)
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
If I don't have you

Late at night I reach to hold you tight
But you're not there (you're just not there baby)
I know you still care (I know you still care)
And oh how I miss your soft, tender, lovely kiss
You give to me so tenderly
We used to feel that time would stand still
And when I see you baby it will
So hurry honey
You know your man needs you so

If I don't have you (don't have you)
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I can't go on in this world alone
Baby its true (baby its true, if I don't have you)
If you said goodbye (u said goodbye)
Girl I would die (girl I would die)
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
If I don't have you

If I don't have you (don't have you)
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I can't go on in this world alone
Baby its true (baby its true, if I don't have you)
If you said goodbye (u said goodbye)
Girl I would die (girl I would die)
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
If I don't have you
You know I'll go crazy without you
If I don't have you (don't have you)
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I can't go on in this world alone
Baby its true (baby its true, if I don't have you)
If you said goodbye (u said goodbye)
Girl I would die (girl I would die)
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
If I don't have you
