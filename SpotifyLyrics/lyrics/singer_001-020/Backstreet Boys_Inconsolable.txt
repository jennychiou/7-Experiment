I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight
Without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling, oh
If you were here right now, I swear
I'd tell you this

Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge but I can't take the fall, no
I memorized the number
So why can't I make the call?
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility, oh

Baby I don't want to waste another day (another day)
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

No no no
I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
Everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Oh, I can't let go, yeah

'Cause baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever want (oh yeah)
It comes right down to you (to you), to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable, no, no

Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh
I'm inconsolable, whoa yeah
I'm inconsolable, yeah
