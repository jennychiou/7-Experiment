If I could right the wrongs that made you cry
Girl would you promise not to say good-bye
'Cause I'm holding on
With A Love so strong
And I can't take the day without you by my side

Girl If I could change
If I could change your mind
Maybe you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes

Girl Don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
That there's a broken heart that lies within your hands

So If I could change (So if I could change)
And it won't hurt your pride (and it won't hurt your pride)
Baby you can help me stop these tears from my cries

Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile (your pretty smile)
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child

Like a child
Just like a child
With her spirit running free
She drove me wild
Oh, she did

Like a child (oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child
