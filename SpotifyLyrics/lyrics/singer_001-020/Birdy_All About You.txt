Why does she make sure to be so immature about these things
I don't want you to change around it
And sometimes this love will end and all will be forgotten
Then someday we will laugh about it
And you say that it's alright
And I know that it's a lie
From the black in your eyes

You don't have to do this on your own
Like there's no one that cares about you
You don't have to act like you're alone
Like the walls are closing in around you

You don't have to pretend no one knows
Like there's no one that understands you
I'm not just some face you used to know
I know all about you

And you should know that someone cares about you
I know all about you

Here I am still holding on you're finding ways to break the bonds,
They're stronger than you realize
You could say that I've not tried, I've let you down,
Left you behind but you're the one who's saying goodbye
And you say that it's alright
And I know that it's a lie
From the black in your eyes

You don't have to do this on your own
Like there's no one that cares about you
You don't have to act like you're alone
Like the walls are closing in around you

You don't have to pretend no one knows
Like there's no one that understands you
I'm not just some face you used to know
I know all about you

And you should know that someone cares about you
I know all about you
And you should know that someone cares about you
I know all about you

And you say that it's alright
And I know that it's a lie
From the black in your eyes

Here I am still holding on you're finding ways to break the bonds,
They're stronger than you realize
And you could say that I've not tried, I've let you down,
Left you behind but you're the one who's saying goodbye

And you don't have to do this on your own
Like there's no one that cares about you
You don't have to act like you're alone
Like the walls are closing in around you

You don't have to pretend no one knows
Like there's no one that understands you
I'm not just some face you used to know
I know all about you
I know all about you
