'Cause there's always tomorrow
But tomorrow never knows

Time keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of

Time keeps running away
No matter what's left behind

Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of

Keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of
Time

Time keeps running away
No matter what's left behind
It keeps on moving
Tomorrow is not in today
And all of your yesterdays
Are only a matter of
Time
