Goodbye my friends
So long
Light falls away
Gone another day

So long my friends
Goodbye, this is not the end
Tomorrow
Yeah

We'll go higher than we
We've been
I won't leave no
Not a thing
For the home swim

For it's always been, somewhere in between
Light falls away
And it's easy to see, hope in our dreams

So don't let me, sleep to long
For I, don't want to miss a thing, with you

We'll go higher than we
We've been
I won't leave no
Not a thing
For the home swim
We'll go higher than we
We've been
I won't leave no
Not a thing
For the home swim

For it's always been, somewhere in between
Light falls away
And it's easy to see, hope in our dreams

Night, my friends
Tomorrow will start again
At first light
