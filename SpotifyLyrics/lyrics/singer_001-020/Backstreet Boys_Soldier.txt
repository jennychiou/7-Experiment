Wanna be there just in time,
Wanna be your shining knight,
Protect you like a soldier.

I wanna be the first in line,
Be the one to save your life
All I wanna do is hold you.

But somebody shot you down,
Right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little,
When you've heard those lies,
You need someone to make you believe,
Make you believe, oh, oh.

I will be your soldier,
I, I'll stay and fight it 'til it's over, oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

You don't have to hide your scars
I'll be there when you fall apart
And fix you like a soldier, oh
You don't have to go too far
Baby, just lay down your arms,
Now that battle is over.

Somebody shot you down,
Right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little,
When you've heard those lies,
You need someone to make you believe,
Make you believe, oh oh.

I will be your soldier,
I, I'll stay and fight it 'til it's over, oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.

Somebody shot you down,
Right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little,
When you heard those lies,
You need someone to make you believe,
Make you believe, oh oh.

I will be your soldier,
I, I'll stay and fight it 'til it's over, oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
