Well, I can't
Remember
Much at all
Before the fall
So tell me
Why you're here
Looking over
My shoulder
Seems none of us
Are any older

So tell me
Why you're here
And how
How high must we climb
In order to fall
What will it be this time
Just waiting for your call
And the joker says "Son,
Don't you know
You're on your own"
Me and you
We're on our own

Standing

In the lion's den
You don't need
Much of anything

So tell me
Why you're here
And how
How high must we climb
In order to fall
What will it be this time
Just waiting for your call
And the joker says "Son,
Don't you know
(Ah ooh oh oh)
You're on your own"
Me and you
We're on our own

Me and you
We're on our own
