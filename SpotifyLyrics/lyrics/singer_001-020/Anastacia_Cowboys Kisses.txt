Cowboys and kisses
Cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself every time you go away

Baggy blue jeans and a box of magazines
Is all I have of you
Waitin' on the day you walk back in my life
Like a newborn child, you made me smile,
Then stole my heart away
We may be outta touch, but never out of time
(Come back to me boy) Come back to me boy

(Cowboys and kisses)
Always seem to bring me down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself every time you go away

Holdin' on to you like a pair of old shoes
That you never throw away
Every road still leads me back to you, yeah
Your little white lies and butterflies made me shed a tear
Still I'm prayin' on the day that you'll be mine (mine)
Why do all these

(Cowboys and kisses)
Always seem to bring me down (down)
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
(Damn those) Cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself every time you go away
Everytime, every time baby

(Cowboys and kisses)
(Always seem to bring me down)
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself every time you go away
Yeah

Why do I keep on holding you
When all you do is hurt me?
All my friends say I should let you go
So afraid that I might see
I can't keep on living life like this
Up and down in and out
I wonder, is this world just a cowboy and a kiss?
Or should I choose another?

(Cowboys and kisses)
Always seem to bring me down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
I said I gotta find myself every time you go away
Everytime - Everytime you go away

(Cowboys and kisses)
Always seem to bring me down
You're like a weight in my pocket
Everytime you come around
Damn those cowboys and kisses
Gotta find myself every time you go away
I said I said I said I said
Gotta find myself every time you go away
Gotta find myself every time you go away
Yeah
(Cowboys and kisses)
Yeah yeah yeah
