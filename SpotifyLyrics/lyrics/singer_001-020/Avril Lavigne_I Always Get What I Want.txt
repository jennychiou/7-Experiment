Every now and then we all want something 
Even if there's no way of gettin' it 
If I stomp my feet quick that may be
Be the way around it
Could I get myself around it?

Get me what I want 
Everything I don't got 
So give me what I want 
'Cause I'm a big shot 

Don't wanna always have to be so nice 
Don't wanna hear you say "well that's just life"
I'll drown you out when I open my mouth 
And make my way around it
I always make my way around it 

Get me what I want 
Everything I don't got 
Give me what I want 
'Cause I'm a big shot 

So give me what I want 
I always get what I want 
You don't want to see me when 
I don't get what I want 
It's not what you want 

I'm not about to take no for an answer 
No, if I tell you I can't
I'm still gonna go 
I did it all by myself and I found
I found my way around it 

Get me what I want 
Everything I don't got 
Give me what I want 
'Cause I'm a big shot 

So give me what I want 
I always get what I want 
You don't want to see me when 
I don't get what I want 
It's not what you want 

It's not too lovely 
It can start to get ugly 
It really bugs me 
If I don't get my way

Get me what I want 
Everything I don't got 
So give me what I want 
'Cause I'm a big shot

So give me what I want 
I always get what I want 
You don't want to see me when 
I don't get what I want 
It's not what you want
If I don't get what I want 
It's not what you want
