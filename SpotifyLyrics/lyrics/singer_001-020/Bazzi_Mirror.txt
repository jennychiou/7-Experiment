Just gotta
Clear my head a little bit

I don't know what I'm looking for
I don't know what to say anymore
Wouldn't call it sad, I wouldn't call it mad
Something is just not right
I don't wanna feel like this anymore

That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
I don't wanna feel like this anymore, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't know what's wrong
But this feeling so strong, let it go
Wishing I could just forget all the gossip in my head
Couldn't tell you what's missing
Man, it's nothing specific
Just a feeling, I'm tripping
Got me so fucked up
Wish I could lift this up
Oh, no, no, no, no

That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
I don't wanna feel like this anymore, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fighting with my mind
Crossing every line
Getting too close
I just gotta breathe
Smoke a little weed
Learn to let it go

I know that I'm meant for more than this
I just gotta leave my head and start to live

That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
