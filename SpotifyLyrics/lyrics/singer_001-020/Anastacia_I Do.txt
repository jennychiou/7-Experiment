Who are they anyway
With their sticks and stones
Don't they know that we know?
There's a chill within their bones
They blame and they mame
Make us feel so cold inside
But they cannot take us there 'cause we will fight

I think the world's gone crazy
I think the world's gone crazy
I think the world's gone crazy
I think the world's gone crazy

Who wants a love without anger and rage?
I do
Who wants a world where a kid can be safe?
I do
Who wants to pray for the end of the pain
For the calm at the end of the day
Where there's not always more of the same
I do

Wanna breathe
Wanna move and not ever feel afraid
Wanna live in a place
Where the truth still finds a way
To rise and advise
And when everything is lies you break
Cause there's nowhere you can run and still feel safe

I think the world's gone crazy
I think the world's gone crazy
(Yeah)
I think the world's gone crazy
I think the world's gone crazy
(Whaoo)

Who wants a love without anger and rage?
I do
Who wants a world where a kid can be safe?
I do
Who wants to pray for the end of the pain
For the calm at the end of the day
Where there's not always more of the same
I do

I won't be a part of something so obscene
I think I'm falling
But I won't be falling

Who wants a love without anger and rage?
I do
Who wants a world where a kid can be safe?
I do
Who wants to pray for the end of the pain
For the calm at the end of the day
Where there's not always more of the same
I do
