Everyday it's getting worse
Do the same things and it hurts
I don't know if I should cry
All I know is that I'm trying
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you (but you make it so hard to do)

What's the point of making plans
You break all the ones we have
I don't know where we went wrong
'Cause we used to be so strong
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you

So why can't you be,
Be good to me

I don't ask for much, all I want is love
Someone to see, that's all I need
Somebody to be, Somebody to be, Somebody to be
Good to me, Good to me
Can you be good to me
Good to me, please

I used to think I had it all
Then one day we hit a wall
I had hoped you were the one
Where's my dream, Where has it gone
I wanted to be with you
Forever just me and you

So why can't you be,
Be good to me

I don't ask for much, all I want is love
Someone to see, that's all I need
Somebody to be, Somebody to be, Somebody to be
Good to me, Good to me
Can you be good to me
Good to me, please

What it is
What's good
I'll make you shine like a star up in Hollywood
I'll be your knight in shining armor
Your prince in this saga
Never cash with me I'm bringing drama
Never that, oh
You wanted love like monopoly
Smile like you look like you want a lot of me
And I will be good to you a while
Miss Ashley Tisdale

Where do I go from here
You've gotten under my skin
And I don't know how to get out
Of this place that I'm in

I don't ask for much, all I want is love
Someone to see, that's all I need
Somebody to be, Somebody to be, Somebody to be
Good to me, Good to me
Can you be good to me
Good to me, please
