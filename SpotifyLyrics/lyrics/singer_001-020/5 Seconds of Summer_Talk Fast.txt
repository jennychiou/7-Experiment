I don't wanna think about a moment with you
I'm kinda hoping for forever
I've been dreaming about a knitted sweater for two
Goddamnit, we look good together

Would you wait, a moment?
Ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait, a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

Oh, talk fast, romance
Oh, won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh, won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you

Leave all you're in-decisions with you at home
Don't say you're doing me a favor
Why so complicated, won't you throw me a bone?
I want your love in every flavor

Would you wait, a moment?
Ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait, a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

Oh, talk fast, romance
Oh, won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh, won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call

Talk fast, romance
Oh, talk fast, romance
Oh, won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh, won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you

Talk fast, oh, oh
Won't last, oh, oh
Burn, crash, oh, oh
Talk fast, oh, oh
