Aaron: Just back off dawg, she wants me

Nick: Are You talkin' junk?

Aaron: Haha! Dude you can't have her... C'mon

Nick: check it out
Saw you when you were trying to kick it to her
Got a little kiss and you were
Tellin' everybody that she was in to you
Don't tell me you think you got her
It's all become a little hotter
She's been going with me, I guess you never knew
Don't get hung up about it
It's not you that she needs, no...

I'm the one, she told me so
I don't want to be the one to tell you
It's not you she wants to see, it's me
So give it up, turn her loose
You knew you were never meant to be
You're too blind to see
You gotta let it be, she wants me me
She wants me me

Aaron: All right, I'm gonna break it down
She's got you kind of mixed up and twisted
You had a good shot and missed it
Sorry bro, I guess you're getting too confused
She told me I'm the one she runs to
Whenever she wants a fun dude
You better get your facts straight
I'm telling you the truth
You're too hung up about it
And you don't really know what she needs

I'm the one, she told me so
I don't want to be the one to tell youIt's not you she wants to see, it's me
So give it up, turn her loose
You knew you were never meant to be
You're too blind to see
You gotta let it be, she wants me me
