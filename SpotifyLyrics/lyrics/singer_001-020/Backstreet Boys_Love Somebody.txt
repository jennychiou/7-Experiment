Love
Is it too much to ask for
One minute to breath
Cause you take my breath away
Like I'd never sink

You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall

You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night
Cause nothing that I could dream
It's better the you by my side

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I, 
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine, I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody

When you wake up with no make up
You try hiding your face,
You know that I, and it's so cute,
You don't even know
How beautiful you are in me

You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall
It's the reason why after every summer we fall
And the way that you look in those purple jeans
It's the sexiest thing I ever see

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I 
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I

When the games on
You wear the jersey of my favorite team
I yell at the TV...
You're not even mad of me
You know I love you baby

I love somebody, love somebody
I know, I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I, I'm so in love
I can die right now and be fine, I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I'm gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love girl 
Love somebody, love somebody
