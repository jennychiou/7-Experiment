He was working at the record shop
I would kiss him in the parking lot
Tasted like cigarettes and soda pop
17

He would tell me I was beautiful
Sneaking in the neighbors swimming pool
Yeah he taught me how to break the rules
17

Hey
Those days are long gone
But when I hear that song
It takes me back

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
And that's the way it's supposed to be

Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favorite place was sitting in his car
17 (17)

We laid a blanket on the rooftop
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold but we kept 'em hot
17 (17)

Hey
Those days are long gone
But when I hear that song
It takes me back

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
And that's the way it's supposed to be
We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me
We were living the dream
We were 17

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
17
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
17

Yeah, I remember what it felt like
Just a small town kind of life
If I could only just go back in time
17

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
And that's the way it's supposed to be
We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me
We were living the dream
And we were 17
