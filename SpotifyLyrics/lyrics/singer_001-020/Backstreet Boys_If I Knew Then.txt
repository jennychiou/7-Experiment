Life should be like a game of cards
You make a mistake
Then fold the deck and start over
It should be just like drivin' in your car
Get lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
'Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Wish I get remote controls
Then I just rewind into
The time it was better
It should have a restart button
So, I could travel right back
To the day that I met her

But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
'Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

'Cause there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
See once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
