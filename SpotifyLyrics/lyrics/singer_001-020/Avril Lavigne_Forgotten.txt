I'm giving up on everything because you mess me up 
Don't know how much you screwed it up 
You never listen
That's just too bad 
Because I'm moving on 
I won't forget you were the one that was wrong 
I know I need to step up and be strong 
Don't patronize me

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted
Do you forget it's now 
You never got it
Do you get it now

Gotta get away 
There's no point in thinking about yesterday 
It's too late now 
It will never be the same 
We're so different now

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted
Do you forget it's now 
You never got it
Do you get it now

I know I wanna run away
Run away 
If only I could run away
Run away 
I told you what I wanted
What I wanted 
I was forgotten
I won't be forgotten never again 

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted
Do you forget it's now 
You never got it
Do you get it now
