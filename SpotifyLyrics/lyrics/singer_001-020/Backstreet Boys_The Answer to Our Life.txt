You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come, but you know that it's not too late
There's been to many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To face our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start a new

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life
