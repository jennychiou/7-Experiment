November
Not much to remember
You were not in sight
December
Change of the weather
You were by my side

Love is all we want
Love
Love is all we need
Is all that we really want

No matter where the day goes
I know you're close by
Changes in the seasons
It's just what's required

Love is all we want
Love
Love is all we need
Is all that we really want

Love is all we want
Love
Love is all we need
Is all that we really want

Yeah love, love, love
Is we what we want
Is what we want
Is what we really need
Love, love, love, love
Is what we want
Is what we want
It's what we really need

Yeah yeah love
Is what we want
Is what we really want
Yeah hey yeah
Love
