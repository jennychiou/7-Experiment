The boxer in the ring
Blocking all of the shots
This chaser of a dream
Who will never stop
G-g-gets up when knocked down
Protects you every round
There are no rules here
Don't need no fence, no rope
This life won't take me out

Don't ring the bell
Just leave me here
Don't ring the bell
I, I won't give up
Don't ring the bell
Just leave me here
Been thrown in the game, yeah
Nothing can phase me

I'm woken up to see the light
I'll never give up on this fight
Dare to dream and realize
We are, we are bloody lucky
Beauty lies in every scar
With never doubting who you are
Reaching up to touch the stars
We are, we are bloody lucky

Hit me like you do
Don't wait

I'm a boxer in the ring
I ain't got nothing to prove
I'm a survivor by name
Whether I win or loose
And with every mistake
Only so much that you can take
There are no rules here
Don't need no fence, no rope
This life won't take me out

Don't ring the bell
Just leave me here
Don't ring the bell
I, I won't give up
Don't ring the bell
Just leave me here
Been thrown in the game, yeah
Nothing can phase me

I'm woken up to see the light
I'll never give up on this fight
Dare to dream and realize
We are, we are bloody lucky
Beauty lies in every scar
With never doubting who you are
Reaching up to touch the stars
We are, we are bloody lucky

Hit me like you do
Don't wait
Hit me like you do
Always
Hit me like you do
Don't wait
We are, we are bloody lucky

Been thrown in the game, yeah
Been thrown in the game, yeah
