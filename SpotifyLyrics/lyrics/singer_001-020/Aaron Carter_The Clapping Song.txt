Three six nine
The goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven on a little row boat

Clap pat - clap pat - clap pat - clap slap
Clap Pat! Clap you hand...
Pat it on your partners hand... right hand
Clap pat! Clap you hand...
Cross it with your left arm
Pat your partner left palm
Clap slap! Clap your hand...
Slap your thigh and sing a little song

My mama told me
If I was lucky
That she would treat me
If I was goody
My auntie told her
I should act older
No, I'm not kidding
That's why she told her

Three six nine
The goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven on a little row boat

Clap! Clap
Clap your hands and prepare to pat
Take your right arm
Pat your partner palm with your right palm

Clap
Take your hand back and clap
Clap
Take your right arm
Cross your right arm with your left arm
Pat your partner left palm with your left palm
Clap
Now back with a clap

Take your hand with your palm and slap your thigh
And watch the fun materialize
As we sing this little song:

My mama told me
If I was lucky
That she would treat me
If I was goody
My auntie told her
I should act older
No, I'm not kidding
That's why she told her

Three six nine
The goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven in a little row boat

My mama told me
If I was lucky
That she would treat me
If I was goody
My auntie told her
I should act older
No, I'm not kidding
That's why she told her
That's why she told her

My mama told me
If I was lucky
That she would treat me
If I was goody
My auntie told her
I should act older
No, I'm not kidding
That's why she told her
Can you believe it?

Three six nine
The goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey choked
And they all went to heaven in a little row boat
