"'Luke:"'
For a while, we pretended
That we never had to end it
But we knew we'd have to say goodbye
You were crying at the airport
When they finally closed the plane door
I could barely hold it all inside

"'Luke and Michael:"'
Torn in two
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of...

"'All:"'
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are

"'Calum:"'
I could fly a thousand oceans
But there's nothing that compares to what we had
And so I'll walk alone

"'Calum and Ashton:"'
I wish I didn't have to be gone
Maybe you've already moved on
But the truth is I don't want to know

"'Luke and Michael:"'
Torn in two
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of...

"'All:"'
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are

"'Luke:"'
You can say we'll be together someday
But nothing lasts forever, nothing stays the same
So why can't I stop feeling this way?

"'Calum:"'
Torn in two
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of...

"'All:"'
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
"'Luke:"'
Wherever you are
