I'm the one, I'm the one who knows the dance
I'm the one, I'm the one who's got the prance
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants
I wear the pants

I'm the one who tells you what to do
You're the one, you're the one if I let you
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants
I wear the pants

Hey you, follow me,
Or take the lead
Can't you see,
Don't you question me
You just do what I say

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm happening

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on the scene

I don't have to try
To make you realize
Anything I wanna do,
Anything I'm gonna do,
Anything I wanna do, I do
And I don't have to try

Don't you disagree,
'Cause you know it's all about me
Be at my beck and call
I'm a know-it-all
And it's all your fault

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm happening

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on the scene

I don't have to try ("don't have to, don't have to")
To make you realize ("to make you, to make you")
Anything I wanna do,
Anything I'm gonna do,
Anything I wanna do, I do
And I don't have to try ("don't have to try")

I don't have to try ("don't have to, don't have to")
To make you realize ("to make you, to make you")
Anything I wanna do,
Anything I'm gonna do,
Anything I wanna do, I do
And I don't have to try ("don't have to try")
