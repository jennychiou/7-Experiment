U... S... A...
Bang your head to this, come on
U... S... A...
Bang your heads to this

I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America
A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America
A O, A O, A O, A O

Come on

Does this sound a little serious to you
Has Aaron Carter turned red, white and blue
I've been rollin' like this since day one
But I never bring it all in your face
I have fun,
It's time to get down
Ain't no time to clown around
Right about now time fix the frown
Face to face and body to body
We're gonna pull through
Come on everybody

Troubled times bring
About troubled minds
I'll cheer you up, baby
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere in between
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dreams

I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America
A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America
A O, A O, A O, A O
Come on!
It's where I'm from
And where I'm at
I'm feelin' proud
And I got it like that
It ain't a diss
So don't take it like that
The grass ain't greener
Uh uh, forget that

From the valleys to the hills to the snow
All the friends and fam I know you know
Everybody come together
Make it half black, white, Spanish, Chinese
Show me what you got, uh

Troubled times bring
About troubled minds
I'll cheer you up, baby
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere inbetween
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dreams

I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America
A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America
A O, A O, A O, A O

Come on

U... S... A...
Bang your heads to this, come on
U... S... A...
Bang your heads to this, come on
U... S... A...
Bang your heads to this, come on
U... S... A...
Bang your heads to this, come on

I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America
A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say

A O, A O, A O, A O

Come on

I was born, I was raised
In the US of A

A O, A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
