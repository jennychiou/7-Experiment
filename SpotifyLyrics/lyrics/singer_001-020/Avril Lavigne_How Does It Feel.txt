I'm not afraid of anything 
I just need to know that I can breathe 
I don't need much of anything 
But suddenly, suddenly 
I am small and the world is big 
All around me is fast moving 
Surrounded by so many things 
Suddenly, suddenly 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

I am young and I am free 
But I get tired and I get weak 
I get lost and I can't sleep 
But suddenly, suddenly 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

Would you comfort me? 
Would you cry with me? 

I am small and the world is big 
But I am not afraid of anything 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

How does it feel, how does it feel 
You're different from me, different
