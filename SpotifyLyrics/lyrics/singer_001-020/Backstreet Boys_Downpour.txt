Oh yeah yeah
I've been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na (repeats a few more times)
Feel the rain

I've been losin days
Shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I, I'm goin' crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Feel the rain

Oh no
I thought you were the only
One, but now I think I was
Wrong 'cause life goes on
Na na na na na (repeats a few more times)

I've been walking around inside a haze

Oh I

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour (I wanna feel the rain)
I wanna Feel the rain

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
In a downpour, I wanna
Feel the rain

In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain, oh oh

I wanna feel the rain
