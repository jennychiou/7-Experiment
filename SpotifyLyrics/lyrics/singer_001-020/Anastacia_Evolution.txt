Evolution, evolution, evolution, evolution

You tell me I'm so full of shit
Just cause you're not prepared for this
Well I helped you changing I know it
I say that I'm so different now
Faces change and still somehow
I'm able to see where I'm going

I can never stand still
'Cause I would fall apart
It took everything to have
To come this far
To turn these pages
Turning pages no regrets
Changes have happened to me

Evolution, yeah

I barely recognize myself
Sometimes I feel like someone else
Don't always have to be perfect
And if I stumble on the way
I don't know I'm gonna be okay
It's alright to get myself dirty

I can never stand still
'Cause I would fall apart
It took everything to have
To come this far
Pages
Turning pages no regrets
Changes have happened to me

To turn these pages
Turning pages no regrets
Changes have happened to me
Ooh, yeah

Evolution, evolution
No one stays the same
Everyone will change

Evolution, evolution
