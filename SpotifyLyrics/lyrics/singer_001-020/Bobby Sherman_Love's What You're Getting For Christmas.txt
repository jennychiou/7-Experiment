How do you go about
Tyin' a bow about love?
Where is a package sold
So big that it'll hold love?
Love's what you're gettin' for Christmas
That's what you're gettin' from me.
Only thing I wonder
How to get it under your tree Christmas morning.
Can't write to Santa and
Just ask the man to send love.
No shop to drop in for last-minute shoppin' for love.
Love's what you're gettin' for Christmas
Christmas morning you'll see
A beautiful present of love wrapped up in me.

Love, from me to you,
Love, our whole life through.

It just so happens
There's no Christmas wrappin' for love
But, Christmas day, my friend
I've got a way to send love.
Love's what you're gettin' for Christmas
Christmas morning you'll see
A beautiful present of love wrapped up in me.

Can't write to Santa and
Just ask the man to send love
No shop to drop in for last-minute shoppin' for love.
Love's what you're gettin' for Christmas
Christmas morning you'll see
A beautiful present of love,
A bright shiny present of love,
A Christmas present of love
Wrapped up in me.
