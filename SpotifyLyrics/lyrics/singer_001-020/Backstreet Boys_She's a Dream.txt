Ooh
Ooh ooh oh yeah
Oh no
Yeah...

Shorty ain't got cable,
She don't even got a radio, way more than able.
What kinda girl should I take her for?
The perfect kind, just what I like,
Exactly what I had in my mind, a dream...
She's a dream... yeah...

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,
I'm first class every flight.
If she takes the time to open her eyes,
She can realize that she's a dream...
'Cause she knows me...

Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
Cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me...
That's why I make her say... Ooh
Make her say... Ah
Make her say... Uh
Make her say... Ah

Shorty don't know who I am...

And I'm cool with that, if she says so
I even got a lot to her
And when I'm out making pesos?
Ain't nobody treat her like I do her.
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,
The only one on her mind,
She's a dream...
'Cause she knows me...

Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,
Like 3 or 4 times a week
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls and me.
But there's just one, face that I see
She's the only one for me
She's a dream...
'Cause she knows me...
Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
Cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me...
That's why I make her say... Ooh
Make her say... Ah
Make her say... Uh
Make her say... Ah

See, shorty don't know who I am
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,
It's not good to fuss
And I know she loves me, for me
And I love her, for her
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me

She don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
Cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me...
Uuuuuh
Make her say... Ah
Make her say... Uh
Make her say... Ah

About me...
