Stop it, stop it
Stop it, stop it
Go, stop and go
I just hit static
I used to read you
Loud and clear
Not like this
It's so erratic

And I'm not rational
When I see you around
Your inconsistency
And you know it's dragging me down
You're so conflicted baby

You're always walking away (walking away)
One step and every thing's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

Stop it
I've made mistakes
I've been an addict
A blind fanatic
Don't you know
You're not immune to the panic
With somebody

When the snow hits your skin
The cold don't last forever
But you're livin' again
If you don't let seasons change

You're always walking away (walking away)
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me

Stop it, stop it
Stop and go

Panic!
You're always walking away (walking away)
(You're always walking away)
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry
