Can we talk a while?
'Cause I need You
Lord, I miss Your smile
Said, I need You
I know I'm not the same, ya see
If we could only be, the way it was
Then I'd never let You go

Just one more chance
I knew I was wrong
Don't give up so easily
Don't You know it's killing me?
Just one more chance, to sing this song
I'll never let You down, no
Just one more chance

I know that I hurt You
Don't You realize?
Confused, thought we were through
Can I tell You that I, I never felt like this?
This pain, I can't ignore
I want You back, and I'll never let You go

Just one more chance
I knew I was wrong
Don't give up so easily
Don't You know it's killing me?
Just one more chance, to sing this song
I'll never let You down, no
Just one more chance

I never felt like this, this pain I can't ignore

Said whoa yeah, whoa yeah

Just one more chance
I knew I was wrong
Don't give up so easily
Don't You know it's killing me?
Just one more chance, to sing this song
I'll never let You down, no, no, no
No no no

One more chance
Don't give up so easily
Don't You know, don't you know
It's killing me?
To sing this song
I'll never let You down
Just one more chance

One more chance
