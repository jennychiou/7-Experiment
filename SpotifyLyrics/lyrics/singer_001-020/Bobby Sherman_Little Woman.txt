Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world and leave your world behind
Come on now
Na, na, na, na...
You got to come down from that cloud girl and Leave your world behind

When you're with me I feel sunshine Even when I'm standing in the rain
Something happens that I can't explain When I hear your name
But you can't help it that
You're always chasing rainbows in your mind
There's so much I wanna say to you
And there's so little time.

Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world
And leave your world behind
Na, na, na, na...
You got to come down from that cloud girl and Leave your world behind.

What do you see, when your walking down a busy street and I'm not there
Is my picture hanging in your mind
Walking with you there
That's how it is in my world girl
You're with me all the time
Why don't you come into my world and leave your world behind.

Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world and leave your world behind
All right now... Na, na, na, na...
You got to come down from that cloud girl and Leave your world behind.
