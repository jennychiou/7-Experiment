This is for the lovers
Strictly for the lovers
Yeah
You got someone you wanna get close to
Then get close to this

Ooh
Ooh
Just to be close to ya

Like a flower to a tree
That's how close I want to be
To your heart
(Baby to your heart, heart)
Like the stars to the night
And daytime is to light
We'll never part
(We'll never part)

I want you to be
(I want you to be)
The only thing that I see
'Cause I believe it's our destiny

Just to be close
Just to be close
It's the only thing
That I wanna do
Ooh, just to be close (close)
Just to be close
Just to be close to you
(Closer to you)
Just to be close

So lonely is the night
Without you to hold me tight
(I wanna hold you closer)
I need ya
(Baby hold me closer, closer)

My life would mean nothing
Without the joy you bring
To Me
You know
You know
You know
There will never be
No one else for me
You are like a dream
That became reality

Just to be close
Just to be close
It's the only thing
That I wanna do
Ooh, just to be close (close)
Just to be close
Just to be close to you
(Closer to you)
Just to be close

I'm gonna give you all my love
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
All my love
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
Give you everything you need
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
Give you all you want
(To be close to you)
To be close to you
(Close to you)
Close to you

Just to be close

It's the only thing
That I wanna do
Ooh, just to be close (close)
Just to be close

I don't want to be alone
I'll never, never, never ever let you go
Just wanna be close to you
I don't want to be alone girl
I'll never, never, never ever let you got
Just to be close
