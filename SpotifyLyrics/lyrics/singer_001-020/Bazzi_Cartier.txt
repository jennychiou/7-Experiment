And that's the thing
That thing right there
That's my girl, I can't share
Maybe I'm selfish, I get a little jealous
I lose my mind when you say that
Balmain silk slip off your back
You get so impatient
I know you got your cravings
So tell me you didn't tell all of your girlfriends about this (yeah)
Tell me you still think my neighbors don't know, girl, you shout it (yeah)
Girl, I know that you've been trying, I swear I'm the proudest (yeah)
But the question is, girl, do you think you could live without it? (Without it)

Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet
Silhouette through the shower
Fuck you 24 hours
Sun peeking through the curtains
Know I'm with you when you're hurting
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet

Nothing on you when you naked
Got a pretty little heart, I don't wanna break it
Girl, I just want to save you
Swear to God, thank the Lord every day that he made you
All the girls tryna flex, they don't phase you
Take you down with my guns, then we blaze, ooh
Get rough, I'ma stay through, stay through
'Cause she rare (oh, yeah)
The way she lookin' in the mirror unfair
You know we couldn't even make it upstairs
Had to hit it right there

Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet
Silhouette through the shower
Fuck you 24 hours
Sun peeking through the curtains
Know I'm with you when you're hurting
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet, yeah, yeah
