I'm a mess when it comes to you
I've got no inhibitions whatsoever it's true
I'm not the kinda girl who runs around like this
Caught up in a kiss best friend with benefits

You're so racy you're my favorite guy
So unruly so uncivilized
Cupid got me right between my eyes
You know you got bit real bad
Doin' things that you never did

Ooh, ooh... you wake up in your bra and your makeup
Ooh, ooh... car's in the driveway parked sideways
Yeah I know this is killin' me
I'm leavin' every piece of my conscience behind
Ooh, ooh... I'm such a hot mess, I'm such a hot mess,
I'm such a hot mess with you

With you, I never knew lovin' you could be so fun
It's true I was such a good, good girl
Before you came along

But you're so racy you're my favorite guy
So unruly so uncivilized
Cupid got me right between my eyes
You know you got bit real bad
Doin' things that you never did

Ooh, ooh... you wake up in your bra and your makeup
Ooh, ooh... car's in the driveway parked sideways
Yeah I know this is killin' me
I'm leavin' every piece of my conscience behind
Ooh, ooh... I'm such a hot mess, I'm such a hot mess,
I'm such a hot mess with you

I'm getting speeding tickets, I'm acting just like a misfit
I'm lettin' my mail pile up to the ceiling
You're makin' me irresponsible
'Cause I just wanna be with you
Act rambunctious and see what I do
Go hard hit that gas
Live your life like it's all you have
Push, push harder make it last
All this love is worth the mess... hot mess

Ooh, ooh... you wake up in your bra and your makeup
Ooh, ooh... car's in the driveway parked sideways
Yeah I know this is killin' me
I'm leavin' every piece of my conscience behind
Ooh, ooh... I'm such a hot mess, I'm such a hot mess,
I'm such a hot mess with you
