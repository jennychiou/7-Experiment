Got a million reasons to run and hide
I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no)
'Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you
Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware)
I would change the stories ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do

I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me

This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
I'm here now
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
I'm here now

I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
Your moving on (yeah)
I could flip back over that hour glass
And refill the better half (the better half)

And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
Wont you dry up all those tear drops and start again

I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me

This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
I'm here now
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
I'm here now

If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go
I'll take it slow
Cause there's no need to rush when I know
I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me

This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
I'm here now
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
I'm here now
