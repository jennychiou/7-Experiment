""Hello?"
"Hi, it's me, what's up baby? I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight, so don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Wait, wait, say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really droppin' out, I think my battery must be low. Listen, if you can hear me, we're goin' to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!""

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should have said, "No, someone's waiting for me..."
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years done, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry (""Hello...?"")
Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry (""Hello...?"")
Gotta go...

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go...!

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry

We're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"
