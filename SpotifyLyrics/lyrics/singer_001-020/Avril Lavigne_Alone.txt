Uh uh, oh oh oh
Uh uh, oh oh oh

Hey man...
Tell me what were you thinking?
What the hell were you saying?
Oh c'mon now,
Stop and think about it

Hey now,
Maybe you should just listen,
Maybe you should stop talking
For a second shut up, listen to me

You're so obvious,
You're so oblivious,
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone

So don't apologize,
You don't even realize,
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

Uh uh, oh oh oh
Uh uh, oh oh oh

Hey bro'...
I'm just tryin' to let you know,
You really think that you're special,
Oh c'mon now,
I've seen so much better

Hey there,
Did you actually think that I cared
To know if you want to go there,
Oh c'mon now,
Keep on, keep on dreaming

You're so obvious (obvious),
You're so oblivious,
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone (alone)

So don't apologize,
You don't even realize,
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

If you... want to... be my... uh uh oh,
You know... you can't... play games
And you know what I mean
Sorry,... but you don't... get my, my uh uh oh
I'm gone, you're still... dreaming... about me
Over and over and over and over and over again

You're so obvious,
You're so oblivious,
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone (you're the one alone)

So don't apologize,
You don't even realize,
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone (alone, alone, alone)

You're so obvious (obvious),
You're so oblivious (oblivious),
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone (you're the one alone)

So don't apologize (apoligize),
You don't even realize,
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

Uh uh, oh oh oh
Uh uh, oh oh oh
Uh uh, oh oh oh
Uh uh, oh oh oh
Alone
