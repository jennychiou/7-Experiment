Out of the rain, looking for sunshine
I call your name, but you're like a ghost
I let you disappear, should've never let you go
I want to say just for the record
That you still got my heart and my soul
You know we're worlds apart
Yeah, I've got to let you know
You are the piece I can't replace, oh
You left a mark that won't erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
'Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Nevermind what people say 'cause they don't understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it

Some try to break through the walls
...But they don't compare to you
One chance, I swear I'll never let you go
You are the piece I can't replace, oh
You left a mark that won't erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
'Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Nevermind what people say 'cause they don't understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it

One should... with time
Never gonna fade, one can touch the flame and tame the fire
You are the piece I can't replace, oh
You left a mark that won't erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
'Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Nevermind what people say 'cause they don't understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
