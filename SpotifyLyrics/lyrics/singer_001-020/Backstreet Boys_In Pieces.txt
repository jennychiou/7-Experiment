So I lay awake another hour
Just like the one before
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore
I hear the sound
Of my own breathing
It makes me miss you more

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me
As I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

I can't take the chance
Of running into
You running into me
So lock the door
And close the window
I just wanna see
Until the day
Inside my future
When I'll be on my feet

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me
As I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I don't wanna see what we've become
The damage has all been done

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
The damage is done
I don't wanna be somewhere
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Somewhere where you can ?help me bleed baby?
Leave me here in pieces

Just leave me in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just wake me up when it's over
Just wake me up when it's over
