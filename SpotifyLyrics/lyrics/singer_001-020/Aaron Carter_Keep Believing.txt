When I look into your sad eyes
It makes me feel for you
'Cause I don't see the light
That was always shining through
Someone broke your heart
Now it's easy to give up
I'm telling you
It's not the end
It's not the end of love

Keep believing, baby
Cause anything happens for a reason
Though tonight tears fill your eyes
Don't stop dreamin' girl
I'll be right here to lean on
You're gonna make it through
I wanna see you
Keep believing

Has anybody ever told you
How beautiful you truly ar
Just one smile from you
Can open up any heart
You deserve that too
Let somebody lift you up
You gotta know
Somewhere out there
You're gonna find love... yeah

Keep believing, baby
Cause anything happens for a reason
Though tonight tears fill your eyes
Don't stop dreamin' girl
I'll be right here to lean on
You're gonna make it through
I wanna see you (pause)

Keep believing just have faith
I promise you the clouds will break
And someday soon
You'll see the sun
And find that someone...

Keep believing (pause)
Cause anything happens for a reason
Though tonight tears fill your eyes
Don't stop dreamin' girl
I'll be right here to lean on
You're gonna make it through
I wanna see you
Keep believing...

Keep believing...
