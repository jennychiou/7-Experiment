Yeah

It keeps raining in my head
Won't stop falling
Things were done and words were said
That won't stop haunting me
I could choose not to forgive
And loose my innocence
And face the fate of those who live
In foolish confidence
Who I am, Where I stand

I will be me
This I know for sure
And I'll still believe
When there's darkness at my door
I'm holding on (holding on)
To the fire burning deep inside of me

Yeah

In this crazy, mixed up world
Know it's hard to hold your ground
Never know which way to lean
I stumbled and I've found
I'm chasing demons in my head
And they keep winning
Leaves me reaching for the thread
Of a new beginning
Who I am, where I stand

I will be me
This I know for sure
And I'll still believe
When there's darkness at my door
I'm holding on (holding on)
To the fire burning deep inside of me

I gotta long, long way to go
But the one thing that I know is

I will be me
This I know for sure
And I'll still believe
E yeah, e yeah

I will be me
This I know for sure
And I'll still believe
When there's darkness at my door
I'm holding... and I'm holding on
To the fire burning deep inside of me

Oh, oh
To the fire burning deep inside of me
