Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in

Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss till we're naked, baby

Versace on the floor
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

Now I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you

Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

So just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss till we're naked, baby

Versace on the floor
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Dance

It's warmin' up
Can you feel it?
It's warmin' up
Can you feel it?
It's warmin' up
Can you feel it, baby?
It's warmin' up
Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more
Let's just kiss till we're naked

Versace on the floor
Hey, baby
Take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

Versace on the floor
Floor
