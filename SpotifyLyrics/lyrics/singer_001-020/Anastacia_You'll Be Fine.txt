You're so perfect heaven blessed
Never felt a love like this
Why you why now so helpless
Sounds so crazy I must confess

There ain't a thing I wouldn't sacrifice
'Cause I won't let you go without a fight

Pieces of a dream unfolding what happened to the fairy tale
Words of love are never spoken things in life aren't always fair
Ill protect you and ill guide you and ill give you all the love that is mine
Just know in time, You'll be fine

Places, faces aren't to blame
I promise forever my love wont change
Be strong hold on don't let me go
What's a perfect ending no one knows

There ain't a thing I wouldn't sacrifice
'Cause I won't let you go without a fight

Pieces of a dream unfolding what happened to the fairy tale
Words of love are never spoken things in life aren't always fair
Ill protect you and ill guide you and ill give you all the love that is mine

Just know in time, You'll be fine
