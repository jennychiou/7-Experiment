[Verse 1]
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be

[Pre-Chorus]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?

[Chorus]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like 2 in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like 2 in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Verse 2]
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a crowded room, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
Getting close to you, but here we are?

[Chorus]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like 2 in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like 2 in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Bridge]
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)
Is it love? Is it fate?
Where it leads, who can say?
Maybe you and I were meant to be

[Chorus]
What, what
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
2 in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)
Like 2 in a million (It's like 2 in a million), like once in a life, yeah (Whoa)
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
2 in a million, once in a life
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
2 in a million, once in a life
