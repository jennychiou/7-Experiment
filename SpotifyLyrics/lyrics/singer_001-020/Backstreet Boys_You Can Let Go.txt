I could see in your eyes
Broken windows, falling skies
Baby, baby, what you hiding from
Like they followed you around (?)
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

You've been holding on so long
Trying to make believe that nothin's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Sifting through the shattered dreams
Living in the in between
Baby, baby it's going to be all right
All right
(You can let go)
And when you're lost, let down,
Disappointed, jerked around
In this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side

That you can let go
Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes
There's a crack in the dark

You never let me see you cryin'
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby, let me hold you tight

Make it all right

Baby, baby, it's gonna be all right
'Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
Yeah Yeah
I won't turn against you
Baby, baby, it's gonna be all right
'Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
Yeah Yeah

You can let go

You've been holding on so long
Trying to make believe that nothin's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know
