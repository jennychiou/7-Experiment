Uh, yeah you can do it

I didn't give a damn what you say to me
I don't really care what you think of me
'Cause either way you're gonna think what you believe
There's nothing you could say that would hurt me

I'm better off without you anyway
I thought it would be hard but I'm ok
I don't need you if you're gonna be that way
Because with me, it's all or nothing

I'm sick of this shit, don't deny
You're a waste of time
I'm sick of this shit, don't ask why

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone, so long
I can do better, I can do better
Hey, hey you
I found myself again
That's why you're gone
I can do better, I can do better

You're so full of shit
I can't stand the way you act
I just can't comprehend
I don't think that you can handle it
I'm way over, over it

I will drink as much lemoncello as I can
And I'll do again and again
I don't really care what you have to say
'Cause you know, you know you're nothing

(I'm so sick)
I'm sick of your shit, don't deny
You're a waste of time
I'm sick of your shit, don't ask why

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone, so long
I can do better, I can do better
Hey, hey you
I found myself again
That's why you're gone
I can do better, I can do better

What'd you say
I told you so
You know that
'Cause I always know
Get outta my face
Hey hey
You're not my taste
Hey hey
I am so
Sick of you
You're on my nerves
I want to puke
Get outta my face
Hey hey
You're not my taste
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone, so long
I can do better, I can do better
Hey, hey you
I found myself again
That's why you're gone
I can do better, I can do better

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone, so long
I can do better, I can do better
Hey, hey you
I found myself again
That's why you're gone
I can do better, I can do better
