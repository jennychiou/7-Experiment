Eighty-Six Charlie came over
He asked me for a favour
Asked me a question
Asked me to make an exception

Eighty-Six Charlie, he came back
Said he'd been thinking it over
Said he's had a change of heart
He thinks he's made a grave mistake

But I, I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
You make things so easy
I'll never forget you

Eighty-Six Charlie, he came back, he came back
Sat down at the table, and for the last time
Said he's finally made up his mind
He wonders if it's not too late
It's not too late because

I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
You made me so angry
I'll never forget you
