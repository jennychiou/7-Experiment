I got the need for speedin' on a hot night
Pushing 150 just to get a rise
There's no comfort in comfort I need the edge
But the edge keeps drifting it's all in my head
Ooh, remember back in Hollywood
The medication flowing through my veins was you
Yeah, the summer back in Hollywood
The medication, medication

Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Wanna breathe it out 'cause I'm going out my mind
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
'Cause I'm chasing the original high
Chasing the original high

I'm tryin' to buy a fix but there ain't no price
I try to feed the hunger that keeps me up at night
We were on a trip tryna replicate
But the highs I hit just ain't doin' it for me
Ooh, remember back in Hollywood
The medication flowing through my veins was you
Yeah, the summer back in Hollywood
The medication, medication

Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Wanna breathe it out 'cause I'm going out my mind
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
'Cause I'm chasing the original high
Chasing the original high

Ooh, summertime it stays on my mind 'cause you and me are alive inside
Summertime is stuck on my mind
Summertime it stays on my mind 'cause you and me never die inside
Summertime is stuck on my mind
Chasing the original high... high... high... high... high...
So high, yeah!

Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Wanna breathe it out 'cause I'm going out my mind
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
'Cause I'm chasing the original high
Chasing the original high
