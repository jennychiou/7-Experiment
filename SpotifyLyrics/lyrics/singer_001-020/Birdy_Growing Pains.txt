Trying to change your mind is like the weather
And you don't make my heart beat like you used to
I've been waiting for a sign
You've been saving all your lines
We could save each other for the better
And when you say my name, I'll be a memory
This is more than we had planned
Choices taken from our hands
Finally there's space to stand alone

My mind is a runaway
And I find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?
I feel these growing pains
Have made us far too strong
But change if you want to change
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?

You could lose yourself and search forever
Looking for the person that you'll never be
We've been trying to compensate
Time to learn from our mistakes
Maybe one day, we'll fit back together
I'll pick up the pieces and we'll rearrange
Now we need to follow fate
Now we look the other way
Now we find the strength to stand alone

My mind is a runaway
And I find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?
I feel these growing pains
Have made us far too strong
But change if you want to change
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?

We've been changing into something more
Familiar faces turning into stone
These growing pains have made us far too strong
We move along, we move along

I find it's too hard to breathe
Say what you want to say
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?

My mind is a runaway
And I find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?
I feel these growing pains
Have made us far too strong
But change if you want to change
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?

My mind is a runaway
And I find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?
I feel these growing pains
Have made us far too strong
But change if you want to change
Are you there? Tell me, are you there?
