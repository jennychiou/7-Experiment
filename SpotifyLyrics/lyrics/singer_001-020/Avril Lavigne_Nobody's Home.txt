Well I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way, she felt it, every day
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make, the same mistakes again

What's wrong what's wrong, now
Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Open your eyes (Open your eyes)
And look outside, find the reasons why (Find the reasons why)
You've been rejected (You've been rejected)
And now you can't find, what you've left behind

Be strong be strong, now
Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Her feeling she hides, her dreams she can't find
She's losing her mind, she's fallen behind
She can't find her place, she's losing her faith
She's fallen from grace, she's all over the place (Yeah yeah)

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

She's lost inside, lost inside
She's lost inside, lost inside
