Th-Th-This beat is hypnotic
I wanna ride like a chauffeur
The sound of zonic's
Controlling me just like a robot
I go bionic, so D-D-DJ put it on
I'm losing logic and cruising deeper in the zone

(David Jassy:)
It's so cinematic
Charismatic

(David Jassy and Ashley Tisdale:)
G-Got me froze up

(David Jassy:)
This psychopathic
Beat is something

(David Jassy and Ashley Tisdale:)
I need a dose of
I'm systematic
Mo-Moving every single bone
There's no mechanic
That can't understand what I'm on

(Ashley Tisdale:)
Let's crank it up {crank it up}
Until the walls cave in
Crank it up {Crank it up}
Put the record on spin
'Cause I am ready to party
Gonna get my girls and get naughty
Crank it up {Crank it up}
Until the walls cave in
Just crank it up

Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa {Crank it up}
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa

Th-Th-This beat is melodic
Harmonic, got me striking poses
I get up on it, electronically feeling so fresh
It's so erotic my body's like a cyclone
I'm like a puppet, can't stop it
Drop it like a stone

Up, up, up, DJ, up, up, up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up louder!

I systematically mo-move every bone
So crank it up I wanna get in the zone
