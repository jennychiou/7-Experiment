All the time that we spend together
I won't fuss, I won't fight
Tryin' to make you mine
You know I'm not that kind
Ha Wooh Ah c'mon

I said I'll love you 'til the 12th of never
But I won't run far ahead
Leaving you behind
You know I'm not that kind

'Cause I'm not that kind of girl
(Not that kind) (Not that kind of girl)
And it's not my kind of world
(Not that kind) (Not that kind of girl)
No it's not for me (Not that kind)
Not where I wanna be (No, oh oh)
(Not that kind of girl)

Help me out
Tell me what you're thinkin'
If I rush, slow me down
You can take your time
You know I'm not that kind (Not that kind)
Yeah (No I'm not that kind of girl)
Woooh

If you leave, I believe life will go on
The wind will blow, water flow
And the sun will shine, yeah it will
You know I'm not that kind
Yeah

'Cause I'm not that kind of girl
(Not that kind) (Not that kind of girl)
And it's not my kind of world
(Not that kind) (Not that kind of girl)
No it's not for me (Not that kind)
So live and set you free
Yeah

Now what I say to you
I would say to no other
I've got my friends
I won't look for another in you, yeah
So what you gonna do?
Yeah yeah yeah

'Cause if you swing with me
You soon will discover
I give you tenderness
Unlike any other can do
Ooh
And what I say is true
Yeah yeah yeah

'Cause I'm not that kind of girl
And it's not my kind of world
No it's not for me, not for me
I said not where I wanna be
Said not where I wanna be, yeah
It's not my kinda thing,
It's not the way, way we wanna swing
It's not for you, it's not for me
I said my baby
I'm not that kind
I'm not that kind, yeah
No (not that kind)
Not that kind of girl
