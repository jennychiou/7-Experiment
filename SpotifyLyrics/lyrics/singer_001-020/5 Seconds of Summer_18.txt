I wish that I was eighteen
To do all the things
You read in a magazine
I'm not saying I want to be Charlie Sheen

She's just a little bit older
But I want to get to know her
She said it's already over

So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you

She told me to meet her there
I can't afford the bus fare
I'm not old enough for her
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen


I think she wants to get with me
But she's got a job in the city
Says that she's always too busy

She's got a naughty tattoo
In a place that I want to get to
But my mom still drives me to school

So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you

She told me to meet her there
I can't afford the bus fare
I'm not old enough for her
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

You got me waiting in a queue
For a bar I can't get into
I'm not old enough for you
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

In my bedroom thinking of you
Her pictures in my private folder
I know one day that I will hold her
I'll make my move when I get older
Make my move when I get older

She told me to meet her there
I can't afford the bus fare
I'm not old enough for her
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

You got me waiting in a queue
For a bar I can't get into
I'm not old enough for you
I'm just waiting 'til I'm eighteen

I'm so sick of waiting 'til I'm eighteen
