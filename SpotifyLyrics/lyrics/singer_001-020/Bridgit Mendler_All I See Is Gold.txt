I've got a sea of flowers
But all these hours are just mine alone
No one's home
Bought me the finiest china
Each time I dine it's always me alone
With the heater on
Left to your own devices
A master of disguises
Why is that not surprising
It's like you're midas

Ooh ooh
Now all I see is gold
All I see is gold
Ooh ooh
Now all I see is gold
All I see is gold

You're probably somewhere sunny
And I'm here wondering if you dream of me
While you're by the sea
Of all the people passing
Your face appears in everyone I see
But you're not with me
And now I just can't tell if
That's just the way you felt
When we were just beginning
You've turn to midas

Ooh ooh
Now all I see is gold
All I see is gold
Ooh ooh
Now all I see is gold
All I see is gold

And when you hold my hand
I don't feel anything
All I feel is cold
And all I see is gold

Ooh it's like your midas

Ooh ooh
Now all I see is gold
All I see is gold
Ooh ooh
All I see is gold
All I see is gold

Ooh
All I see is gold
All I see is gold
All I see is gold
