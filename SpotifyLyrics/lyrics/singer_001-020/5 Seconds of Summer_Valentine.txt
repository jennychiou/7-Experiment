I love the light in your eyes and the dark in your heart
You love our permanent chase and the bite of our bark
We know we're classic together like Egyptian gold
We love us

It don't matter, be combative or be sweet cherry pie
It don't matter just as long as I get all you tonight

I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

So deep, your DNA's being messed with my touch
Can't beat us
So real, fueling the fire until we combust
Can't touch us

It don't matter be combative or sweet cherry pie
It don't matter just as long as I get all you tonight

I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

Full plate, don't wait, have your cake and eat it too
Full plate, don't wait, have your cake and eat it

I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine
Valentine, valentine
