Trouble Is
How come you never know what you've got
Until it's gone
Too bad, 'cause I never felt so good with anyone
How fool was I into thinking I was gonna be all right... okay... fine

So every day I try a little harder to forget her
I'm here to convince myself tomorrow will be better

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me now she's gone .(yeah)
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is love is what the trouble is
(Oh it's what the trouble is..)

How come she said you'll never wear your heart
When I can see
Too bad, cause now I'm the one who's sorry
How stupid was I into thinking I was gonna be all right... okay... fine

So every day I find a little something to remind me
No matter how I try, I can't put the past behind me

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
Whos gonna save me, now she's gone (yeah)
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
Now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is

I'm all right, I'm okay, I'll be fine, give it time
But the only...

Trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes every night (oh no no)
Whos gonna save me, now she's gone (now she's gone)
The trouble is there's still a part of me that still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)
And now I know what it is (yes I know) now I know what it is cause love is what the trouble is
(The trouble is)
Love is what the trouble is.(hey hey)
