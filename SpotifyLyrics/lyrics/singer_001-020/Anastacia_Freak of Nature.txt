Excuse me
What you said to me?
Oh no you said that
No I'm not
I'm sorry but, you know
I ain't that kind of girl

Look at me and see a little girl inside my skin
It's a supernatural
Ooh
So don't be trying to push upon me baby
My momma told me better than that
The bigger you are
The harder you fall

I'm a bobby original
Not typical
Not ooh la la baby
You can hold me responible
It's chemical
If you're bringin' it out in me

Ah ah ah
I'm a freak of nature
You better be aware, danger
Ah ah ah

I'm a freak
Come on yeah
I'm a freak of nature

I'm a little material, got bling bling
My glasses got a shade
Yeah
But does it hit me
It chicken me
That barefoot walking in the grass
Just 'cause I like sipping on champagne
Doesn't mean that I'm afraid of the rain

I'm a bomb, not a physical
Not practical
Not planned ahead baby
If you open that door right back prepare yourself
'Cause the world has been changing

Ah ah ah
Freak of nature, yeah
You better be aware, danger
Ah ah ah

Freaky, geeky, lucky and weekly, sassefras or honey
