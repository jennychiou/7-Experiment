You're like spring turned into winter
With you there's no in-between
Something's won't be meant to last
Too much of a good thing
Peaceful I step into your water
Swim until I almost drown
Now I'm down to one more breath
Hmm, I'm too deep to get out
Love so unkind
Once the sun light hits your eyes
I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it'll leave you blind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Faded pictures
Painted like a photograph
From yesterday
How could time change us so far?
Hmm, a memory now past
Love so unkind
Once the sun light hits your eyes
I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it'll leave you blind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Nightmare dreamer really lover
Used to crave that nothing changes
Only pain heals this condition now

I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it'll leave you blind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Oh a little for me
Oh cry just a little for me
