I'm the kind a girl who doesn't say a word
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I'm about to break out, about to break out
I'm like a crook tonight

I caught you staring at me and I was thinking clearly
And now I'm like a bee and I'm hunting for the honey
And I'm kinda shy but you're super fly
Yeah, I could be your kryptonite

Oh, light my heart up baby, like a matchstick
Oh, and hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you

Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la la la, la la la
And I'll find you, ready or not
Ready or not

Hello my name is, nice to meet you
I think you're famous, where have I seen you?
You'll be my William, I'll be your Kate
Living like a fairytale

We could have a palace right next to Oprah
37 cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away, wherever you say
Yeah we could be setting sail

Oh, light my heart up baby, like a matchstick
Oh, and hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you

Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la la la, la la la
And I'll find you, ready or not
Ready or not

Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come, boy it's on

Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come, boy it's on

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you

Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la la la, la la la
And I'll find you, ready or not
Ready or not

You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not
