Hmm, yeah yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now, don't bother 
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me 
From the man that I've because, oh yeah

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is tragical
So, help me 
I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother 
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me
From the man I've because, oh

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape, the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of
Show you the shape of my heart
