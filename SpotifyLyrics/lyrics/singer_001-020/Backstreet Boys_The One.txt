I'll be the one 

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more them mysteries and lies

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
The helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one "(I'll be the one)"
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light "(I'll be the light)"
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you 
And make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my fear is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one "(I'll be the one)"
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light "(I'll be the light)"
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright

You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams comin' true
I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand, begging please

I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run

I'll be the one "(I'll be the one)"
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light "(I'll be the light)"
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one 
To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright
I'll be the one
