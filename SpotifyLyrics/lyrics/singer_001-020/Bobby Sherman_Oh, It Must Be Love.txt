All my friends say I'm acting strange
Every time I hear your name
'Cause lately I'm never the same
When we're together
It's pure love and pleasure
Girl you made my life change

Oh, it must be love
Oh, it must be love
Love, love, love girl, it must be
(Sha la la la, Sha la la la)

All the trees never looked so green
And the air never smelled so clean
Girl you taught my heart how to sing
When you're near to me
Life's so dear to me
Every day is just like a dream

Oh, it must be love
Oh, it must be love
Love, love, love girl, it must be
(Sha la la la, Sha la la la)

I've been lonely long enough
It won't happen no more
I've got you to share my life
It's not like before
Girl you can take me and remake me
If you want me baby I'm yours

Oh, it must be love
Oh, it must be love
Love, love, love girl, it must be
(Sha la la la, Sha la la la
Oh, it must be love)

(Sha la la la, Sha la la la
Oh, it must be love)

(Sha la la la, Sha la la la
Oh it must be love)
