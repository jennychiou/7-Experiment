I love that accent you have when you say hello
You relocated from New York a month ago
That minivan that you drive really gets me going
And if it feels like it's right then it can't be wrong

No one understands the chemistry we have
And it came out of nowhere
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
It's not like we planned
It's getting out of hand
And now we're gonna go there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Walk my way Mrs All American
Say my name, no need to pretend
Don't be shy Mrs All American
I'll show you why you're not gonna walk away

Not just a neighbour, oh hey there I'll ring your bell
Open your door, pucker up and I'll kiss you well
My lips are sealed, there's nobody that I would tell
Your secret's mine, close your eyes and I'll make you melt

No one understands the chemistry we have
And it came out of nowhere
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
It's not like we planned
It's getting out of hand
And now we're gonna go there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Walk my way Mrs All American
Say my name, no need to pretend
Don't be shy Mrs All American
I'll show you why you're not gonna walk away

Na na na na na na na na (You know she like)
Na na na na na na na na (You know she like)
Na na na na na na na na (Ah, you know she like)

Walk my way Mrs All American
Say my name, no need to pretend
Don't be shy Mrs All American
I'll show you why you're not gonna walk away

Walk my way
Say my name,
You're not gonna walk away
Don't be shy
I'll show you why you're not gonna walk away
