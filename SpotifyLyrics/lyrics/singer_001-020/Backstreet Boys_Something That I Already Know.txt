Here we are
Seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
This ritual's, habitual,
But it's never gonna work this time

We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back
And wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed
It never will
All these years of standing still
Still we'll stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby you're not in it
We're not what we used to be,
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
To hear

Something that I already know
I know I know I know
Something that I already know
I know I know I know

So save your voice
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye, feels permanent,
So wish me well, try to forget

All the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And it's finally come to this

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby you're not in it
We're not what we used to be,
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
To hear
Something that I already know

We can not hide
What we've become
So sick and tired of being done,
It's done
It's done
It's done

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby you're not in it
We're not what we used to be,
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
To hear

Something that I already know
I know I know I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know I know I know
Something that I already know
'Cause I know I know I know
I know 'cause I know
