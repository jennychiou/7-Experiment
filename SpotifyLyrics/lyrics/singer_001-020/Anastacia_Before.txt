Thinking all night, thinking all day
About how I used to be before
I'm thinking about her, thinking about me
Always going after more
But she's gone, I get some rest
Don't struggle by me, shutting doors
Thinking all night, thinking all day
About how I used to be before

Chains 'round my neck
Not falling back
Won't let you break me down

And I've figured out
I'm better than I've been before
I am rising high
I'm stronger than I've been before
'Cause I'm not afraid to be alone
And I, I'm breathing on my own
I say, oh oh ohohoh
Ohohoh oh ohohoh
I am rising high
I'm stronger than I've been before

Not picking up sticks, I'm picking up stones
One more but getting less
Some may come and some may go
I'm done feeling like a mess
She was a broken girl
Who always let the pieces fall
I'm thinking about her, I'm thinking about me
Together we are beautiful

Chains 'round my neck
Not falling back
Won't let you break me down

And I've figured out
I'm better than I've been before
I am rising high
I'm stronger than I've been before
'Cause I'm not afraid to be alone
And I, I'm breathing on my own
I say, oh oh ohohoh
Ohohoh oh ohohoh
I am rising high
I'm stronger than I've been before

Let go, it's now or never
Won't stay in chains forever
I'm rising higher
I'm getting stronger, yeah yeah

(And I've figured out)
I'm better than I've been before
(I'm better than I've been, better than I've been)
I am rising high
I'm stronger than I've been before
'Cause I'm not afraid to be alone
And I, I'm breathing on my own
I say, oh oh ohohoh
Ohohoh oh ohohoh
I am rising high
I'm stronger than I've been before

Thinking all night, thinking all day
About how I used to be before
