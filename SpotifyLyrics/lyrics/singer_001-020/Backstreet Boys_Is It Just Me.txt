Used to heatin' up in the shower, at it for hours
Now you're always in a rush
I could be paranoid, but I swear, it's up in the air
Are you fallin' out of love?
The more I think about how we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure it wasn't what it was, yeah
We used to be, used to be better (Used to be better)
We used to talk about growing old, now I don't know
If we gon' make it through the month
Don't wanna make it real if it's not, I wish I could stop
With over-overthinking us, yeah
Feelin' like there's nowhere to go, it's taking a toll
I don't wanna give you up
But we used to be, used to be better

Is it just me or did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or did the nights get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? (Ooh)
Is it just, just me? (Ooh)

It's 2 A.M., you're not even home, I'm here alone
Callin', but your phone is off
You go and blame it all on your friends, not that again
Need to know what's going on, 'cause
The more I think about how we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure I'm not the only one, yeah
We used to be, used to be better

Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

Is it just me or did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or did the nights get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? (Ooh)
Is it just, just me? (Ooh)

Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one
Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

Is it just me or (Just me, baby)
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or (Just me, baby)
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing (Oh)

Is it just, just me?
(Oh, is it just me?)
Oh, is it just, just me?
(I been standin', waitin', gazin' up)
Is it just, just me?
(You know, you know, you know, you know that)
Is it just, just me?
(I been waiting for you, baby, until now)

Is it just me? Is it, is it?
Is it just me? Is it, is it?
