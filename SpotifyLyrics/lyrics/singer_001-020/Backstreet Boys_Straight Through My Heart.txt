In the heart
Of the night
Where it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh Oh

I looked down
And my shirts turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh oh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't, I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh Oh

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Sold√Øer down (my heart)
