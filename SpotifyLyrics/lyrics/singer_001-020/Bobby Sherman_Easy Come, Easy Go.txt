Takin' the shade out of the sun
Whatever made me think that I was number one
I oughta know easy come, easy go
Sittin' it out, spinnin' the dial
Thinkin' about the chump I've been
I have to smile
Didn't I know easy come, easy go
She wasn't kind, I wasn't smart
I lost my mind and fell apart

I had to find myself in time
Now I can start all over again
Hangin' around takin' it slow
Happy I found
I still can smile and dig the show
Lettin' me know easy come, easy go
