(Ah, ah ah) You're so good to me baby, baby (ah, ah ah)

I want to lock you up in my closet when no one's around
I want to push your hand in my pocket because you're allowed
I want to drive you into the corner and kiss you without a sound
I want to stay this way forever, I'll say it loud

Now you're in, you can't get out

You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me want to scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good to me baby, baby

I can make you feel all better, just take it in
And I can show you all the places you've never been
And I can make you say everything that you've never said
And I will let you do anything again and again

So, now you're in, and check it out

You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me want to scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good to me baby, baby

Kiss me gently
Always I know
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go, oh, yeah

You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me

You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good
