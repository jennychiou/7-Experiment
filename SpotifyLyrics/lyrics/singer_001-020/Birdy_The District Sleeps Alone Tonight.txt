Smeared black ink
Your face is ashen
And I'm barely listening
To last demands
I'm staring at the asphalt
Wondering what's buried underneath

Where I am, where I am

I'll wear my badge
A vinyl sticker with big block letters
Adhering to my chest
Tells your new friends
I am a visitor here
I am not permanent
And the only thing
Keeping me dry is

Where I am
(You seem so out of context)
(In this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am
(A stranger with your door key)
(Explaining that I am just visiting)
Where I am
(And I am finally seeing)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

D.C. sleeps alone tonight
D.C. sleeps alone tonight

Where I am
(You seem so out of context)
(In this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am
(A stranger with your door key)
(Explaining that I am just visiting)
Where I am
(And I am finally seeing)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

The district sleeps alone tonight
After the bars turn out their lights
(Where I am)
And send the autos swerving
Into the loneliest evening
(Where I am)
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
