I saw you looking brand new overnight
And I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh
You look happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie to me

It's 3 AM and the moonlight's testing me (ah)
If I can make it till dawn, then it won't be hard to see (ah)
I ain't happy, oh
I ain't too happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
Change your flight so you stay with me
Problem was, I thought I had this right

Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
And I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
