I'm popcorn
I'm a hell storm
Yeah, I'm in the hands of faith
I'm some bad words
Now what you heard?
Who I am I can't escape
And I've been to darker places
That I never thought I'd go
And I've learned lots of lessons
I can say I'm finally home

I can't see the light of day
Even through the rainy haze
O-o-o-o-oh
Toe to toe and face to face
I make no apologies
Story is clear, it's bittersweet
O-o-o-oh
I'm a dark dark white girl

Yeah you mess up and you lose hope
And the pieces slowly fall
It's amusing when you get lost
In the writing on the wall
And it takes everything I have
To live the brighter side
Got my reasons to have demons
Part of me I can't deny

I can't see the light of day
Even through the rainy haze
O-o-o-o-oh
Toe to toe and face to face
I make no apologies
Story is clear, it's bittersweet
O-o-o-oh
I'm a dark dark white girl

No matter if I'm laughing or crying
It ain't gonna stop me from trying
The truth is what I have to uncover
In this only life

I can't see the light of day
Even through the rainy haze
O-o-o-o-oh
Toe to toe and face to face
I make no apologies
Story is clear, it's bittersweet
O-o-o-oh
I'm a dark dark white girl
O-o-o-oh
I'm a dark dark white girl
