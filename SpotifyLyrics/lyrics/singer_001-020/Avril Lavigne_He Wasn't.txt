There's not much going on today
I'm really bored, it's getting late
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate

Sit on my bed alone
Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought
No, he wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for

This is when I start to bite my nails
And clean my room when all else fails 
I think it's time for me to bail
This point of view is getting stale

Sit on my bed alone
Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought
No, he wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for

Na na na na na, we've all got choices
Na na na na, we've all got voices
Na na na na na, stand up make some noise
Na na na na, stand up make some noise

Sit on my bed alone
Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought
No, he wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought
No, he wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
Like I was special, 'cause I was special
