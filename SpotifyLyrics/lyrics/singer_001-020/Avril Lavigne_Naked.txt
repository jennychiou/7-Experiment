I wake up in the morning
Put on my face
The one that's gonna get me
Through another day
Doesn't really matter
How I feel inside
Life is like a game sometimes

Then you came around me
The walls just disappeared
Nothing to surround me
Keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected
See how I've opened up
Oh, you've made me trust

'Cause I've never felt like this before
I'm naked... around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked around you
And it feels so right

I'm trying to remember
Why I was afraid
To be myself
And let the-the covers fall away
Guess I never had
Someone like you
(To help me) To help me fit
In my skin

I've never felt like this before
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you
And it feels so right

I'm naked
Oh oh yeah
Does it show?
Yeah, I'm naked
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh
I'm naked around you
Does it show?

I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide
You're gonna, you're gonna see right through (see right through me and I can't hide)
You're gonna see right through
Oh yeah

I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide
You're gonna see right through baby
