You're not alone, together we stand
I'll be by your side you know I'll take your hand
When it gets cold, and it feels like the end
There's no place to go you know I won't give in
(Ah, ah) No I won't give in (ah, ah-ah)

Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you

There's nothing you can say (nothing you can say)
Nothing you can do (nothing you can do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth so
Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through

So far away, I wish you were here
Before it's too late this could all disappear
Before the doors close, and it comes to an end
With you by my side I will fight and defend
(Ah, ah) I'll fight and defend (ah, ah-ah) Yeah, Yeah

Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you

There's nothing you can say (nothing you can say)
Nothing you can do (nothing you can do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth so
Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through

Hear me when I say when I say "I believe"
Nothing's gonna change nothing's gonna change destiny
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly
Yeah-Eh, Yeah-Eh, Yeah-Eh, Yeah-Eh-Ah-Ah (ah-ah, ah-ah)
La-Da-Da-Da, La-Da-Da-Da, La-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da

Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you

There's nothing you can say (nothing you can say)
Nothing you can do (nothing you can do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth so
Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through

(Ah-ah, ah-ah) Keep holding on
(Ah-ah, ah-ah) Keep holding on
There's nothing you can say (nothing you can say)
Nothing you can do (nothing you can do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth so
Keep holding on (keep holding on)
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
