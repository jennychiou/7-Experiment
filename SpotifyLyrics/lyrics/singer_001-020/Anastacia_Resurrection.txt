I been walking on a road alone
Following footsteps in the dark
Finally learning to forgive
Where I've been
But it, feels like I'm breathing with my heart
And all of the faces
That kept me from places
I needed to go
No longer holding it back from the life I want to know

There's a new sun rising
From a lost horizon
And the heat that its brings
Melts away all the things
That has made me stand still
Been a long time coming
So tired of running
I believe there's a reason
I came through the season again
It's my resurrection
All that I gone through
Is what brought me here
So I can't regret a single thing, yeah
I've had my heart broken
I know what it takes to let go and move on
I see myself coming
And I never been this strong

Cause there's a new sun rising
From a lost horizon
And the heat that its brings
Melts away all the things
That has made me stand still
Been a long time coming
So tired of running
I believe there's a reason
I came through the season again
It's my resurrection

Resurrection
Yeah yeah
Resurrection

New sun rising
Lost horizon
He brings all things
Standing still
Been a long time coming
So tired of running
I believe there's a reason
I came through the season again
Again, again
