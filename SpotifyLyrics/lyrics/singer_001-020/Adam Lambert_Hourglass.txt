Are we ready right now?
I don't know somehow
It feels so right
It's time for our flight
How will we know?
When to go
How will we find?
All the time
All the time

Check for pre-flight
Engines on
Headlong
Into this song
No more good-byes
This is for life
(This is for life)
(This is for life)
(This is for life)
(This is for life)

Through the Hourglass we slide
Searching for the moment to decide
So I will stand tall
Discover it all
I will stand vast
With you at last
So don't lose sight of me now

After all this time
We're still able to shine
You rode from the stars

Straight from the heart

Check for pre-flight
The engines on
Headlong
Into this song
No more good-byes
This is for life
(This is for life)
(This is for life)
(This is for life)
(This is for life)

Through the Hourglass we slide
Searching for the moment to decide
So I will stand tall
Discover it all
I will stand vast
With you at last
I won't lose sight of you now
Oh, it's time
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
And I tell
Longer since

Out here in space
It seems so clear
