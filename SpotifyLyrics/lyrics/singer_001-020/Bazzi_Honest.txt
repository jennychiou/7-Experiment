If we had just been honest

Gonna turn my read receipts on
Just to let you know I won't respond
Girl, it hurts me to do this
But I'm not looking for excuses
And I deleted all your info
'Cause I heard about the info
Always knew that you'd be ruthless
But I never thought that you could do this, oh

And the fucked-up part is I gave y'all the intro?
That was my dude; why'd you gotta pick him though?
I was selfish in the way that I acted
I keep doing things just to get your reaction

Yeah, I wonder if he's there with you now, fucking you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when he's with you
And do you feel no shame?
Does he make you feel the same?
Could we have got what we wanted
Oh, if we had just been honest?

Why can't we just be honest?
If we had just been honest

Remember (yeah)
Late night, smokin', we under star projectors
Looked in my eyes where this lasts forever
I think we both know what was up, where this was goin'
But the sex was too good, we got caught up in the moment
Now you took my best friend and turn him into my opponent
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Did you forget that I gave y'all the intro?
That was my dude; why'd you gotta pick him though?
I was selfish in the way that I acted
I keep doing things just to get a reaction

Yeah, I wonder if he's there with you now, fucking you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when he's with you
And do you feel no shame?
Does he make you feel the same?
Could we have got what we wanted
Oh, if we had just been honest?

Why can't we just be honest?
If we had just been honest
If we had just been honest

Maybe it's the pills
Maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's the pride
