Just when ya thought it was safe

Shake
Shake
Shake

When I hit town
Yo, the party can't fail
I'm hittin' 20
On the Richter scale
Got a hundred million people
Spillin' coffee and stains
On your brand new shirt
Oh, that reminds you of me
When you feel your gums flap
It's Aaron's rap
Watch yourself
I'ma rearrange your map
Do your hands shake, baby
You ain't getting old
It's only Aaron Carter here
To rock and roll

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I
Make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When I drove drop
I'ma shake the foundation
Rock the whole nation
Watch the graduation
Photos flying off the walls
It's amazing, oh no
Trouble with the bass vibration
Race the impact
Of my new track
Take cover
We're coming through like that
All the other
Tracks are wickie wickie whack
Its 2 double 0 2, time to react
From the east, to the west
To the north, to the south
I'm hitting every angle
Shakin' every house
No doubt, uh uh
That's what I'm all about
I can't stop even if you scream and shout
Breakin' up your life like an earthquake right
Strap yourself in
Hold tight, hold tight
Watch your momma's china
Fly like a kite
Shakin' up your life everyday and every night

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I
Make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

Ladies out in Cali say 'not another earthquake'
Fella's out in Cali say 'not another earthquake'
Ladies out in Cali say 'not another earthquake'

Warn your friends its Aaron Carter again

Gotta move baby because it hurts so good
Even with Novacane you couldn't numb the pain
If your sleepin' again
I'ma shake you outta bed, or instead
Gonna shake the confetti for newly weds
Dead in the water, I never did wrong
Comin' through the floor can't stop my song
I bring bass like Jamacins
If you ain't playin' this partner
I can shake the whole station

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I
Make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I
Make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When my joint hits I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go
