Mama never taught me how to love
Daddy never taught me how to feel
Mama never taught me how to touch
Daddy never showed me how to heal

Mama never set a good example
Daddy never held mama's hand
Mama found everything hard to handle
Daddy never stood up like a man

I've walked around broken, emotionally frozen
Gettin' it on, gettin' it wrong

How do you love someone without getting hurt?
How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt?
So far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, how do you love someone?
How do you love, how do you love someone?

I was always the chosen child
Their biggest scandal I became
They told me I'd never survive
But survival's my middle name

I've walked around hopin', just barely copin'
Gettin' it on, gettin' it wrong

How do you love someone without getting hurt?
How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt?
So far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, how do you love someone?
How do you love, how do you love someone?

It's hard to talk... to say what's deep inside
It's hard to tell the truth when you've always lied

How do you love someone without getting hurt?
How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt?
So far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, how do you love someone?
How do you love someone and make it last?
How do you love someone without tripping on the past?
So far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, how do you love someone?
How do you love, how do you love someone?
Someone
