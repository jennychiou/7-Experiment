Woo!
We on a wave, that luxury flow
And I don't watch what I say, but I say what I know
Don't wait on me, it's too late for me
I walk with that step, Cali air what I breathe
And I've been drinkin' all night, so please excuse me
If I say what I mean, blame it on the Hennessy
Can't stop, won't stop, baby

It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too late

Designer on me, I'm covered in that Gucci
Is that tension in the air? Or, baby, is that just me?
Too strong, I'm gone, yeah
Let me switch this flow up real quick
Go-getter, V for Vendetta
Whatever, I just do better
Trendsetter, search for the cheddar
No pressure, float like a feather
Smooth dude, big moves
Big trees, like Snooooop
Now I'm back
Let me bring it back to the track, oh, yeah
Can't stop, won't stop, yeah

It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too late
