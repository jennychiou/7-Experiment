Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
Walk home alone
It's not the first time, it's not the worst crime
Your soul will be okay

When you've had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new

Burns by dreams
It's never how it seems
Cold crushed esteem
Take shelter and hide forever
Your soul will be okay

And you've had enough
Searching for love
But you miss the touch
Of someone new


And you've had enough
Searching for love
But I miss the touch
Of someone new

Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
I will take you home
It's not the first time, it's not the worst crime
Our souls will be okay
