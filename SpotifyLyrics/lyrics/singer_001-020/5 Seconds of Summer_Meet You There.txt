Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love

Every moment spent, I wish I was with you
And every night I slept, I dreamt I was with you
No matter where you go, you know I'd wait for you
I would break in bed, if you wanted me to (lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love)

So you go your way and I'll go mine
And if we're meant to, I'll meet you there
We can't speed up the hands of time
But if we're meant to, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, I'll meet you there
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, I'll meet you there
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love

When it's physical, I can't keep track of days
But the emotional, is more than we can take
Oh, I'm just waiting for, waiting for you
To tell you that, tell you that you're
Oh, I'd keep waiting for, waiting for you
If you wanted me to (lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love)

So you go your way and I'll go mine
And if we're meant to, I'll meet you there
We can't speed up the hands of time
But if we're meant to, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, I'll meet you there
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, I'll meet you there
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love

This time and next time, you know I'll meet you there
This time and next time, you know I'll meet you there
This time and next time, you know I'll meet you there
This time and next time, you know I'll meet you there

So you go your way and I'll go mine
And if we're meant to, I'll meet you there
We can't speed up the hands of time
But if we're meant to, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, I'll meet you there
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, I'll meet you there
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, I'll meet you there

Tell me what's on, on my mind, if this is it
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
