Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Sheets are in a knot
The heart is like rock, hey

Baby I can smell you on my clothes
I try to stay composed
But I feel the fever grow

I keep running away running away running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains breaking the chains
Oh 'cause I know the second you go
Bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me

And I know I want your chokehold
Wantcha to bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back

All these hard confessions I forgave
Complicatiate
But I kinda like the pain, yeah
Baby I can smell you on my clothes
I try to stay composed
But I feel the fever grow whoa-o oh!

I keep running away running away running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains breaking the chains
Oh 'cause I know the second you go
Wantcha to bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me

And you know I want your chokehold
Wantcha to bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

Hey hey
Oh oh I want your chokehold
Oh oh hey hey
Now I'm bring you baby back to me

'Cause I know the second you go
And you know I want your chokehold
Gotta bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Oh oh you gotta bring it right back
