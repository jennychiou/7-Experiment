It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
And ya know we're gonna groove

It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby
Leave it up, leave it up to me

Listen to the kids
Grown ups, own up
Even when they mess up
Actin' like it's all sewn up
Mom and dad think we
Need to have a talk
Think the kids rule the world
Boys and girls

You can't blame us for nada
You taught us, to follow orders
'Cause I'm the baby, dun gotta
Monkey see, ah ah
Monkey do no more
The fun stops here
What's the score

We might start a play fight
Just to imitate you
Don'tcha feel silly now
Shame on you
Don't start to cry now
I don't blame you
After all you're just a grown-up
Whatcha gonna do

Yo it's the kids
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal, don'tcha know, I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

Yo it's the kids
What would ya do if I
Speed it up, speed it up
What what
Set it off
Gonna live it up, live it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

When the grown-ups go a wall
Now nothing's gonna fall
Here come the young ones
The baby crime busters
Big people, listen up
Relax now we're equal
And if the money's right
We might make a sequel

Do I hear a please?
I love it when you beg me
I need a bribe now
Just to move my legs, see
And I might put you in
If you make way
(Lemme talk to my people we can save the day)

Yo it's the kids
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal, don'tcha know, I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

Yo it's the kids
What would ya do if I
Speed it up, speed it up
What what
Set it off
Gonna live it up, live it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

(Now whatcha gonna do)
Mom and dad, they be
Gettin' on my nerves
Workin' and workin' 'em
Is that what I deserve
But after many days
Hey, I want them back
Tell me who's gonna bake
My cake and all that

Who's gonna suffer from
My practical jokes
And answer when I'm mowing
Hey, it's gotta be my folks
And who's gonna get me up
Ready for the flight
And who's gonna tell me
"Every thing's alright"

But wait a minute
That sounds so soft
That won't impress a
Hot chick like Lara Croft
Don't play me out 'cause
I'll switch ya off
You've been told old for too long
Singin' the same song

If you're old enough to vote
Then it's time to sit down
It's all about the little hommies
Takin' the crown
So if you're too young to vote
Here's your chance to have a say
Come on everybody
Help me save the day

Yo it's the kids
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal, don'tcha know, I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

Yo it's the kids
What would ya do if I
Speed it up, speed it up
What what
Set it off
Gonna live it up, live it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

Yo it's the kids
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal, don'tcha know, I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me

Yo it's the kids
What would ya do if I
Speed it up, speed it up
What what
Set it off
Gonna live it up, live it up
Make way, put it on
Gonna hook it up, hook it up
And how's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me
