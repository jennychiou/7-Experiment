Yeah

Turn around take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you are
Try to hide from yesterday
Still the pain never went away
Could it be, history
All the time just repeatin' on me?
Thought that I could break the chains,
The tears and pain, but here I go again

Over and over
On and on
Keep on singing that same old song you know
Is that the way the story goes?
(Same old story)
Hey
(Over and over)
Round and round
This world keeps turing me inside out you know
Is that the way the story goes?
(Same old story)
C'mon

Turn around take a look at your life
Thinkin' that you're living right
Judging only on what you see
Just reflections of your misery
All the shame, from all the names
Build the walls when we're all the same
You think you got an alibi, but it's a lie
Don't even try

Over and over
On and on
Keep on singing that same old song you know
Is that the way the story goes?
(Same old story)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Over and over)
Round and round
This world keeps turing me inside out you know
Is that the way the story goes?
(Same old story)

And you don't know baby
How you're gonna survive
In these troubled times
But if you seek than you shall find
Yeah

I say
Sing it with me y'all

Over and over
On and on
Keep on singing that same old song you know
Is that the way the story goes?
(Same old story)
Yeah
(Over and over)
Round and round
This world keeps turing me inside out you know
Is that the way the story goes?
(Same old story)
