We are the sure fire winners winners winners winners

We're coming up like killing machines
Our big guns gonna shatter your scene
It's pandemonium on the floor
'Cause everybody wants a little more
They wanna ride on the rocket ship
Ride around the moon for a velvet kiss
'Cause all the girls and the boys wanna know
How far this bad wild child's gonna go

We are the sure fire winners
Uh-oh yeah big time hitters

Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
We are, yeah, we are, we are the sure fire winners
Sure fire winners, sure fire winners, sure fire winners

Flick the switch and the missile will fire
I'm a heat seeker when I'm full of desire
We're all drawn to the heat of the flame
'Cause you wanna be a star in the hall of fame
I was born with glitter on my face
My baby clothes made of leather and lace
And all the girls in the club wanna know
Where did all their pretty boys go?

Move over 'cause a new boy's calling it time
