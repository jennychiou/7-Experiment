So they paved the road to providence
And lined up the memories
In reference to what was dead and gone
Then the band and the symphony
In sweet sounding harmony
Lay down their guns in disgust
For they knew their armies at last

So haven't we seen enough
On the cover of
Haven't we had our fun
Watching on the TV screens, oh yeah

So we harbor our hopes and fears
In houses and evergreens
Cast adrift, what we don't need

Then the rhythm of tambourine
And drama of marching scene
Lay down their violence in trust
For they knew how much the cost

So haven't we seen enough
On the cover of
Haven't we had our fun
Watching on the TV screens

For when all is said and done and our aims run
Then we'll come
