Suddenly I, am in front of the lights
Everything I'm feeling, scary and beautiful at the same time
And every day, I try just to breathe
I want to show the whole world
The truth inside of me

Suddenly people know my name
Suddenly everything has changed
Suddenly I feel so alive
In the blink of an eye
My dreams begin to reign

Suddenly time, it feels like the wind
It changes everywhere I go
I'm just trying to fit in
Now here I stand
And I'm still just that girl
I'm following my heart
In this amazing, crazy world

Suddenly people know my name
Suddenly everything has changed
Suddenly I feel so alive
In the blink of an eye

Suddenly I am center stage
Suddenly I am not afraid
Suddenly I believe again
In the blink of an eye

It's happening now
As my dreams begin to reign
I want to say, love me for me, what's inside
I'm gonna be positive, not run away, so much for you
This is life

Suddenly I am center stage
Suddenly I am not afraid
Suddenly I believe again
In the blink of an eye
My dreams begin to reign
