Tell me, won't you tell me what
Won't you tell me what you wanna do
Tell me, won't you tell me what
Won't you tell me what you wanna do

Are you tired, of me
Do you want to, be free
I just got to know
Should I hang on, or let go
Don't keep me guessing
It just ain't fair
You got me drowning in a sea of despair

I've held up for as long as I can
Ooh I need to know, am I still your man

Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl

Putting pressure, on my heart
Maybe we need some time apart
We need to find out what's gone wrong
Before the love's completely gone

I've held up for as long as I can
I need to know am I still your man
Are we past the point, of no return?
Is there a reason to be concerned

Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl oh yeah

Give me a chance
To say what's left of my pride
Please tell me girl (tell me girl)
Is the grass greener on the other side

Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl oh yeah

Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl oh yeah

Tell me
Won't you tell me what
Won't you tell me what you wanna do
Tell me
Won't you tell me what
Won't you tell me what you wanna do
