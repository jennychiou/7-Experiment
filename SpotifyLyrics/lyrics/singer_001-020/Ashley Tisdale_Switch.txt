You're out of this world I'm sure of it
A crazy intuition, you're up and on,
You're here than gone, come back
A curious condition
And then you switch right over
It's weird, yeah I know but
Just can't get a hold of myself

Hey, so strange
You switched right in front of me
Hey, you've changed
Not like you used to be
Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Hey, you're just
Talking like a machine
Hey, I'm stuck
On everyone in between
Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world

You're out of this world I'm sure of it
A little more than different
And you keep lacking, lacking concern of it
It's you that I am missing
And then you switch right over
It's weird, yeah I know but
Just can't get a hold of myself

Hey, so strange
You switched right in front of me
Hey, you've changed
Not like you used to be
Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Hey, you're just
Talking like a machine
Hey, I'm stuck
On everyone in between
Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Wonder where you are, how I can find you
Staring at the stars falling behind you
Across the universe, hope you'll be back soon
I gotta find a place to meet, I'll rearrange it

Hey, so strange
You switched right in front of me
Hey, you've changed
Not like you used to be
Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Hey, you're just
Talking like a machine
Hey, I'm stuck
On everyone in between
Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Open your heart, yeah we're back to the start
Open your heart, Yeah, get back to the start
Open your heart, yeah we're back to the start
Open your heart, yeah get back to the start
Open your heart, yeah we're back to the start
Open your heart, yeah get back to the start
