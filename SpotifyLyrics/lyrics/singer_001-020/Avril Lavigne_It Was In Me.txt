I've been through all the parties and it wasn't there
I followed where my heart leads, it wasn't there
Screamed at the top of my lungs and no one cared
Oh, oh, oh
I searched up on the mountain's top, it wasn't there
I drove a Maserati, no fulfillment there
I round around the whole damn world, to get back here
Oh, oh, oh

Now let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized
All of this time

It was in me
All along it was in me

I took the time to listen and I found it here
I stopped to see the vision and it was clear
Everyone's got an opinion but I don't care
Oh, oh, oh

Now let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized
All of this time

It was in me
All along it was in me

Oh, and I
All I needed was a little faith in my life
All I needed was a little trust in myself
All I needed was to find the truth in my heart
Ah, ah, ah

Let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over, yeah
It was in me (Let me feel high when I'm sober)
It was in me (Let me feel young when I'm older)
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized
All of this time

It was in me, all along
It was in me
