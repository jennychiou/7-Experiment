Whoa, hah
Yeah
Aha

Tell you a story of a love I left behind
It was a broken fairy tale
I gave up all my pride
Let love inside
But tore me all apart when you played with my heart

Let me paint a picture of a cold and rainy night
As the candles fade to black
I played our favorite song
'Til the needle was gone
I've taken all I can,
You've played your last hand

Black roses and a bottle of wine
Those were the only things that I left behind
Keep searching 'cause it's so hard to find
All you got are the tears that you cry
Black roses and wine

Oh yeah

Sorry situation when your castle's made of sand
And it washes out to sea
I pushed your love aside
Cried my last cry
My soul is in bloom
Like flowers in June

Black roses and a bottle of wine
Those were the only things that I left behind
Just keep on searching 'cause it's so hard to find
All you got are the tears that you cry
Black roses and wine

Black roses and a bottle of wine (and a bottle of wine)
Those were the only things that I left behind
Keep searching 'cause it's so hard to find ('cause it's so hard to find)
All you got are the tears that you cry
Black roses and wine (black roses and wine)

You don't miss your water 'til your well runs dry
You don't miss your good thing, 'til it passes you by (passes you by)
Like a bird in the sky, spread your wings and fly

Oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Black roses and a bottle of wine
Those were the only things that I left behind
C'mon keep searching 'cause it's so hard to find
All you got are the tears that you cry
Black roses and wine
