I was the one to run the redlight
Never stop, never stop
Always on the go, go
I thought that you should know, know
I swear, used to love it in the fast lane but
There you are, there you are
Make me wanna pump by breaks
Thinking you got what it takes, yeah

You waved me and I think I'm ready to slow down
Slow down
When I'm with you I feel I'm ready to slow down
Slow down

I was the one to run the redlight
Never stop, never stop
Always on the go, go
I thought that you should know, know
As we riding down love 101
And this has just begun
We found love in the middle of the highway
In the middle of the highway

We found love in the middle of the highway
We found love in the middle of the highway

Let's go two miles an hour
Drop speed, let 'em watch us shine
Let our love show
We ought to let them know, I swear
What it's supposed to be like
School 'em up, school 'em up with love
Let our love show
We ought to let them know, I swear

You waved me and I think I'm ready to slow down
Slow down
When I'm with you I feel I'm ready to slow down
Slow down

I was the one to run the redlight
Never stop, never stop
Always on the go, go
I thought that you should know, know
As we riding down love 101
And this has just begun
We found love in the middle of the highway
In the middle of the highway

We were running in the fast lane
We were always on the go
Let's show 'em how it's done, baby
Drop the speed and let 'em watch us
Watch us shine and let it grow
Let's show 'em how it's done, baby

I was the one to run the redlight
Never stop, never stop
Always on the go, go
I thought that you should know, know
As we riding down love 101
And this has just begun
We found love in the middle of the highway
In the middle of the highway

We found love in the middle of the highway
We found love in the middle of the highway
