Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now I feel invisible to you, like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say

I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

Why, should I care?
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm starting to trip
I'm losing my grip
And I'm in this thing alone

Am I just some chick
You placed beside you
To take somebody's place?
When you turn around
Can you recognize my face?
You used to love me
You used to hug me
But that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't okay

I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

Why, (why) should I care? (care)
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
You (you), you need to listen (listen)
I'm starting to trip
I'm losing my grip
And I'm in this thing alone

Cryin' out loud
I'm cryin' out loud
Cryin' out loud
I'm cryin' out loud

(Open your eyes)
(Open up wide)

Why, (why) should I care? (care)
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why, (why) should I care? (care)
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why, (why) should I care? (care)
If you don't care
Then I don't care
We're not going anywhere

Why, (why) should I care? (care)
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why, (why) should I care? (care)
If you don't care
Then I don't care
We're not going anywhere
