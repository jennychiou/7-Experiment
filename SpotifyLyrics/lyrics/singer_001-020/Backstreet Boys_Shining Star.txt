You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Everytime you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby, when you do the things you do
I wanna be close to you
'Cause I need to feel your every move, oh
Baby you can never say how much
I need your touch, I can't get enough
'Cause you know what to do to turn me on

You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Everytime you're near
You will always be my baby

Baby, you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring
'Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms
'Cause you know what to do to turn me on

You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Everytime you're near
You will always be my baby

I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
'Cause you were doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
'Cause you were doing everything so right
Oh, oh baby

You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Everytime you're near
You will always be my baby

You know that I adore you
Wanna be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby
You know that I adore you
Wanna be there everyday for you
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby

You're my shining star
That is what you are
There is no one like you baby
Angels everywhere
Everytime you're near
You will always be my baby
