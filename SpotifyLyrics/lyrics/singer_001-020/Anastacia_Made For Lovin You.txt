Baby I've been waiting for some time
To find a way to free your mind, yeah
It's the simple things you do to me
That makes my heart forget to beat, yeah yeah
But I ain't here to try to play your fool, no no
I won't ever beg for you
But heaven blessed the day you find
What you've been looking for
Well, my baby you'd better know

How I wanna take you higher
Don't keep me waiting on the outside love
Can't stop it if you wanted to
'Cause I was made for lovin' you, yeah yeah

I guess I thought it was a dream
Locked up in a mystery
Can't guess on what was meant to be
My soul just keeps on telling me, yeah yeah
'Cause I can't take this for another day
I've thought of us a hundred different ways
And I'd do anything for you
'Cause you were made for lovin' me
And me for lovin' you.

How I wanna take you higher
Don't keep me waiting on the outside love
Can't stop it if you wanted to
'Cause I was made for lovin' you, yeah yeah

How I wanna take you higher (I wanna take you higher)
Don't keep me waiting on the outside love
Can't stop it if you wanted to
'Cause I was made for lovin' you, yeah

It's time that you let me know baby
I ain't gonna wait
I ain't gonna play your games
Can't face another day
There's nothing left for me to say
Oh yeah, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

How I wanna take you higher
Don't keep me waiting on the outside love
Can't stop it if you wanted to
'Cause I was made for lovin' you, baby c'mon

How I wanna take you higher
Don't keep me waiting on the outside love
Can't stop it if you wanted to
'Cause I was made for lovin' you, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

How I wanna take you higher
Don't keep me waiting on the outside love
Can't stop it if you wanted to ('cause 'cause 'cause)
'Cause I was made for lovin' you
