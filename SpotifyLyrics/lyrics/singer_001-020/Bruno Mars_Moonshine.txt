Hello
You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips, you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals, oh

Ooh, let's go

You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free, oh

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they knows that Iâ€™m not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again

On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright, oh

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Oh-ooh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Oh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
