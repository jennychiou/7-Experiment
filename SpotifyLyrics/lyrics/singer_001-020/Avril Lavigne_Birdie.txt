Like a bird locked up in a cage called love
He cut the wings when she was born to fly
He said "oh pretty bird, you can't sing
But I buy you diamonds and ruby rings"
Like a bird locked up in a cage

And how can I escape in this place
And go higher, higher?
How can I avoid the flames
From your fire, fire?
And oh, you can't hold me down, no
Oh, you can't fool me now

So birdie fly away (higher, higher)
So birdie fly away (Higher, higher)
So birdie fly away

I'm tired again and lost inside this maze, all day
Your twisted words are getting to my head
I say "and no more glasses and see our stars
And no more bruises and battle scars"
Like a bird locked up in a cage

And how can I escape in this place
And go higher, higher?
How can I avoid the flames
From your fire, fire?
And oh, you can't hold me down, no
Oh, you can't fool me now

So birdie fly away (higher, higher)
So birdie fly away (Higher, higher)
So birdie fly away

I ain't your prisoner
You can't lock me up no more
I'll show you what I'm worth
Take back what I deserve
I ain't your prisoner
It can't chain me down no more
God damn, it's gonna hurt
So fly away, little bird

And how can I escape in this place
And go higher, higher?
How can I avoid the flames
From your fire, fire?
And oh, you can't hold me down, no
Oh, you can't fool me now

So birdie fly away (oh, oh, oh)
Can you hear me? (oh, oh, oh)
Are you listening? (oh, oh, oh)
Set me free, set me free (oh, oh, oh)
Can you hear me? (oh, oh, oh)
Are you listening? (oh, oh, oh)
Set me free, set me free
