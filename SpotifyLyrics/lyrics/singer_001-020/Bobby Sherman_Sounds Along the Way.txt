This afternoon I went downtown
I was looking for your face
Where I walked with you a thousand times before
But the only trace I found
Was a yesterday I lost along the way
I smelled your perfume in the air
And I turned but you weren't there
It was just your portrait painted in my mind
And pictures there of me and you
Memories that like a fool I left behind

Once there was a time when I was yours and you were mine
And every search for you would stop at our front door
You were always waiting there for me at night when I'd come home
I'd see your smiling face and I'd feel great once more

Like a fool I walked away
And some sounds along the way
It was only me just whispering your name
As I walked along the street
Hoping that someday we'd maybe meet again
