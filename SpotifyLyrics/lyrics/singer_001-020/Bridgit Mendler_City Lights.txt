It's a long road and it get's winedy
Fog is real low and it's so blinded
Oh I'm tryna steer, tryna take the lead
But I feel like the road is steering me
Getting so lost, like a cast away
Feeling so crossed, like a renegade
And I'm tryna call out in the big city
Just a small voice and no one's listening to me

Ooh tell me where to go
Tell me that you know
Just how bright I glow

Everytime that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothings brighter
You're the city lights
Everytime that you've waited till the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights
That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, ooh

Oh I'm blending in and I'm sticking out
Like a sore thumb that they don't know about
Wanna make peace, wanna just breathe
Wanna be the light that makes them all believe
I'm the race car, not the spectator
I'm the hero, not the narrator
Hercules, ballaning
Conquering everything, yeah

Ooh tell me where to go
Tell me that you know
Just how bright I glow

Everytime that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothings brighter
You're the city lights
Everytime that you've waited till the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights
That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, ooh

Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights
Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights
Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights
Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights

The city lights ooh
Ooh the city lights
You are

Everytime that you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothings brighter
You're the city lights, you're the city lights
Everytime that you've waited till the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights
That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, ooh
