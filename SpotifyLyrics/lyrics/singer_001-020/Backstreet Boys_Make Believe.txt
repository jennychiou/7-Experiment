We can only make believe 
We can only make believe

Something that you said got into my head 
Here I am falling from the edge 
Waiting for the day I can run away with you, with you 

Like angels on fire we burn the sky 
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe 
You and me together 
We can be king and queen 
Rule another world forever 
We'd set our course to live or die 
Across the universe I'll be by your side 
If we could only believe

We can only make believe 
We can only make believe

Catch another breath, I got nothing left 
This love I have is pulling me to death 
Waiting for the night I can feel alive with you...

Like angels on fire we burn the sky 
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe 
You and me together 
We can be king and queen 
Rule another world forever 
We'd set our course to live or die 
Across the universe I'll be by your side 
If we could only believe

If we close our eyes 
Let our hearts collide 
Leave the world outside 
Leave it all behind 
If we close our eyes 
Let our hearts collide 
Leave the world outside 
Leave it all behind 

Leave the world outside 
Leave it all behind

If we could only make believe 
You and me together 
We can be king and queen 
Rule another world forever 
We'd set our course to live or die 
Across the universe I'll be by your side 
If we could only believe (x2)

If we close our eyes 
(If we could only make believe) 
Let our hearts collide 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave the world outside 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave it all behind 
(If we could only make believe) 
If we close our eyes 
(If we could only make believe) 
Let our hearts collide 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave the world outside 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave it all behind 
(If we could only make believe)
