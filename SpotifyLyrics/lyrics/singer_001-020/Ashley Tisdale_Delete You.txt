It's not time to give this one more try, I don't think so
Last night you said your one last lie

I can let you wreck my plans
I'm planning to let you go
Oh, only one thing is true, only one thing to do
Time to delete you

Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters
This is, this is for the better

Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all my power
Press the button that says, "I don't need you"
Delete you, oh, delete you, oh

It's not time to say how much you care, I don't think so
I don't want you, I want you not there
I'm done, I think that the time's come
To bring this thing to an end

I think this could be goodbye
I think you've run out of time
Time to delete you

Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters
This is, this is for the better

Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all my power
Press the button that says, "I don't need you"
Delete you, delete you

All I want from you is to disappear
All I need from you is for you to not be here
I guess, it's time you got the news
Gonna replace you, erase you
Delete you, delete you
Oh, delete, oh, delete you

Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters
This is, this is for the better

Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all my power
Press the button that says, "I don't need you"
Delete you, oh, delete you
Oh, delete you, oh, delete you

It's time to delete you
Oh, delete you
