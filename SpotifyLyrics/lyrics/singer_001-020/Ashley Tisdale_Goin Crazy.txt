Something about your style got me freakin' out
Hey boy, hey boy
Gotta make you mine and there ain't no doubt
Hey boy, hey boy
You're really laid back and you play it smooth
Hey boy, hey boy
I see the way you move from across the room and I know I'm tripping on you

Boy I'm feeling something real and
I don't know what to do
So excited, I can't hide it
Got my eyes on you

You've got me goin' crazy
Want to be your baby
I don't know what to do
I can't take my eyes off you
You've got me goin' crazy
It's just the way you're moving
I really wish you knew, what you do
I can't take my eyes off you

You so sensational, I think you've got it all
Hey boy, hey boy
And I like the way you're unpredictable
Hey boy, hey boy
Won't you come to me, just like I wished
Hey boy, hey boy
'Cause I never met a guy who made me feel like this
It's a chance that I just can't miss oh

Boy I'm feeling something real and
I don't know what to do
So excited, I can't hide it
Got my eyes on you

Got me losing my mind
Boy wish you were mine
Why don't you send me a sign
I've been losing my sleep
Think I'm falling too deep
Don't know what it is you do to me
What you do to me
