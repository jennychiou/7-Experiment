Someone told me that I'll want more
That I'll feel half empty, ripped and torn
They say there'll be plenty other hands to hold
Now I wish they'd told me long ago

Ooh, I don't want this to break you
Ooh, but I've got no one else to talk to

I don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend,
That we're not falling into the deep end?

You've gone quiet, you don't call
And nothing's funny anymore
And I'll keep trying to help you heal
I'll stop you crying and dry your tears

Ooh, I don't want this to break you
Ooh, but I've got no one else to talk to

I don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend?

Ooh, how do we mend?
Ooh, I didn't choose to depend on you
It's out of our hands
Maybe it will work out in the end

I don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend?

Don't know if you mean everything to me
And I wonder, can I give you what you need?
Don't want to find I've lost it all
Too scared to have no one to call
So can we just pretend,
That we're not falling into the deep end?
