You say that I'm too complicated
Hung up, and mis-educated
Well I say 9 to 5 is overrated
And we all fall down
I can't sleep 'cause my mind keeps racing
My chest hurts 'cause my heart keeps breaking
I'm so numb that I can't stop shaking
And we all fall down

Frustration, desperation
You say you need some kind of medication
Situation, no motivation
Destination, permanent vacation

Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes destination, permanent vacation


Voices coming through the speakers
And they can't make me a believer
I know I'm an underachiever
And we're all so proud

Watch out, I think we're going under
'Cause right now, I'm just another number
Get out, the system's in the gutter
And we're all so proud

Frustration, desperation
You say you need some kind of medication
Situation, no motivation
Destination, permanent vacation

Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes destination, permanent vacation

Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes destination, permanent vacation


Congratulations,
Your imitations are taking over the radio stations
Corporations, calculations
We're the voice of the new generation
