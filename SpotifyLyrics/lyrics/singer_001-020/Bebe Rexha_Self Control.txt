Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

When I get your call
I'm out the door, not a minute more
Like an animal
I lose control, it's illogical
Oh, oh

One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

I'm so predictable
Fall every time, ain't it pitiful?
And it's not enough
I tried to quit but I'm giving up
Oh, oh

One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

And the hunger grows
I'm craving you and my body knows
'Cause it wakes me up
Heart through my chest, this could be love (this could be love)

One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
