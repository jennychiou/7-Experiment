Not a model, not a savior
I'm human too
Just the same as everyone elses
Everything to lose
They say that time heals the pain
'Til only love remains

So I'm gonna stay
Somewhere there's an angel saying stay
I need someone to tell me, I'm too hard to break
I'm not ready to go just yet
I'm not ready to go just yet

Got a message from a wise man
No one gets to choose
But it's still a secret
No one tells us how easily we bruise
And while we try to udnerstand
Live is making other plans

But I'm gonna stay
Somewhere there's an angel saying stay
I need someone to tell me, I'm too hard to break
I'm not ready to go just yet
I'm not ready to go just yet

So I'm gonna stay
But I'm gonna stay
Somewhere there's an angel saying stay
I need someone, I need someone to tell me
I'm not ready to go just yet
I'm not ready to go just yet
I'm not ready to go just yet
I'm not ready to go just yet
