It's been a long time since I took your breath away
I'd rather be blind if I have to watch us fade
Even though I know we're through I still love you
It's been a long time and I fight to face the day
Misery is so unkind and we can't afford to stay
Lost in love, I cry can't seem to hide this
But if your hands are last I hold, I don't how to let it go

'Cause I don't wanna be the one to say it's over
So you're gonna have to be the one 'cause one we say it's over
There'll be no turning back so I just wait here in the past
And that's all I can do 'cause I'm not through loving you

It's been a long time since I felt you look into me
Can't believe it behind that I... but now you look right through me
Lost in love, I cry can't seem to hide this
But if your hands are last I hold
I don't how to let it go

'Cause I don't wanna be the one to say it's over
So you're gonna have to be the one 'cause one we say it's over
There'll be no turning back so I just wait here in the past
And that's all I can do 'cause I'm not through loving you

Pain don't go away with the work of I
Now I'm stuck in the moment and I
Stay hoping you say you're not leaving me
And that's all I can do 'cause I'm not through loving you

'Cause I don't wanna be the one to say it's over
So you're gonna have to be the one 'cause one we say it's over
There'll be no turning back so I just wait here in the past
And that's all I can do 'cause I'm not through loving you

It's all I can do, I'm not through loving you
All I can do, I'm not through loving you
