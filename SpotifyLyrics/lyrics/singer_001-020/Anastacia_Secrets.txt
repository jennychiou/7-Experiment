Late in September
Memories I can't erase
The shiver through autumn
The memory of your face
As I grew much older
I wonder whatever I could have done
To fight all the madness
When I close my eyes

Find truth in what I'm sayin'
They thought it was all a lie
How could they deny it when I was just a little child

Secrets I kept inside me
No one can understand
Secrets I had to hide
'Cause no one would hold my hand when
Secrets for me to know
And never for you to see
Secrets for only me

Emotions so bother my soul
To know that I felt such pain
I thought it would go far away
It did for the moment

Find truth in what I'm sayin'
They thought it was all a lie
How could they deny it when I was just a child
Baby, come on now

Secrets I kept inside me
No one can understand
Secrets I had to hide
'Cause no one would hold my hand when
Secrets for me to know
And never for you to see
Secrets for only me

... The ones that could not escape the pain and misery
Would no one ever set them free?
Why do you pretend to see
All the pain they had to go through
Can't you hear them cry to you?

Secrets I kept inside me
No one can understand
Secrets I had to hide
'Cause no one would hold my hand when
Secrets for me to know
Never for you to see
Secrets for only me
Secrets

Secrets I kept inside me
No one can understand

'Cause no one would hold my hand when
Secrets for me to know
And never for you to see
Secrets for only me

Oh babies crying
People are dying
The secrets inside their heart no one ever yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Come on
Come on and sing with me

Secrets I
I know
There's nobody up in here
That can hear the cries hear
Inside my mind
But I cry
