Mom's not home tonight
So we can roll around have a pillow fight
Like a major rager, OMFG

Let's all slumber party
Like a fat kid on a pack of Smarties
Someone chuck a cupcake at me
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

It's time for Spin the Bottle
Not gonna talk about it tomorrow
Keep it just between you and me

Let's play Truth or Dare now
We can roll around in our underwear how
Every silly kitty should be
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me

Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me

Ka-ka-ka-kawaii!
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so pretty
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so silly

Wake up got a secret
Pinky swear that you're gonna keep it
I've got something you need to see

Let's be friends forever
I wanna do everything with you together
Come and play with kitty and me
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me

Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me

Ka-ka-ka-kawaii!
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so pretty
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so silly
