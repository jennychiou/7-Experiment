There he goes, my baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe, yeah, I know we both know
It isn't time, no, but could you be m-mine?

We'll never get too far, just you, me, and the bar
Silly ménage à trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine? Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone, hey
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all, I wanna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah

There it goes, you stole my so-and-so
'Cause sweetheart no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
Me or can find me
Time to be m-mine, mine

Let's get inside your car, just you, me and the stars
Kind of ménage à trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine? Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone, hey
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all, I wanna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Yeah, baby, you're mine
Baby, you're mine, mine, mine

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all, I wanna get you alone
I got this fever that I can sweat out

Oh baby, lights on, but your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all, I wanna get you alone, yeah
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

Give you my f-f-fever, my f-fever
Give you my f-f-fever, my f-fever
Give you a fever, fever, yeah
Give you a fever, fever, yeah
