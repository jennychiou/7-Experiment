Yeah
Tell me what have you done to me, oh
How come your eyes feel like your hands on me?

(Am I under some magic spell?)
Oh, did you put a hex on my body
(I'm aroused though, boy can't you tell?)
I can't explain it or fight it boy
'Cause I like it

I can feel you from my head (head) to my feet (feet)
You're all over me
I can feel you, when you're not (not) next to me (me)
Taking over me
I can feel you when I kiss you baby
Touch you baby, love you baby
(I can feel you baby if I) kiss you baby
Touch you baby, love you baby, oh

You're in control I'm a slave
To your will baby
Baby you gotta hold on me
Yes your name gives me chills

(Am I under some magic spell?)
Oh, did you put a hex on my body?
(I'm aroused though, boy can't you tell?)
Said I can't explain it or fight it
I like it

I can feel you from my head (head) to my feet (feet)
You're all over me
I can feel you when I kiss you baby
Touch you baby, love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Feels like you're inside
Pushing my buttons
Making me do what you want me to do
(Baby you're not by side)
Baby I can still feel you, oh whoa
Oh!

(I can feel you) from my head (head) to my feet (feet)
You're all over me, yeah
(I can feel you) when your not (not) next to me (me)
Taking over me
I can feel you when I kiss you baby
Touch you baby, love you baby, oh
(I can feel you baby) kiss you baby
