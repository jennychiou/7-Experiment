I'm not the girl that you see in the magazine
Perfect face and perfect body
Never be anyone but the one I am, what I am
I can't bend to your expectations
Look to fulfill any fantasy
If what I am is what you need

Love me for me
And not for someone that I would never be
'Cause what you get is what you see
And I can't be anymore than what I am
Love me for me
Or don't love me

Don't think you're gonna change what's inside of me
Make me who you want me to be
Won't be someone I'm not
Somebody else, someone else
Love me with all my imperfections
Not for an image of your design
Love me for what you see inside

Love me for me (love me baby)
And not for someone that I would never be
'Cause what you get is what you see
And I can't be anymore than what I am (no, no)

Love me for me (yeah, yeah)
And not for someone you wish that I could be


'Cause what you get is what you see (What you see)
And I can't be anymore than what I am (no)
Love me for me
Or don't love me

I'd never do anything to change you (to change you)
Or make you be anything than who you are (who you are)
All that I am is all that I can be
I love you for you
So love me for me

Love me for me
(Yeah, Yeah)
Or don't love me...

Love me for me
And not for someone that I would never be
'Cause what you get is what you see
And I can't be anymore than what I am (no)

Love me for me (love me)
And not for someone you wish that I could be
'Cause what you get is what you see (Is what you see)
So love me for me

Or don't love me

Love me for me

Or don't love me
