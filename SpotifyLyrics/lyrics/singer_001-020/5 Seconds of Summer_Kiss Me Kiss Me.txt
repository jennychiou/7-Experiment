Can I call wake you up on a Sunday?
Late night I think we need to get away
Headlights hold tight turn the radio loud
(Turn the radio loud)
Let me know where to go and I'll get you there
Tell the truth and I'll show you how to dare
Flash lights held tight we can all move down
Never say goodbye

So kiss me kiss me kiss me
And tell me that I'll see you again
'Cause I don't know if I can let you go

So kiss me kiss me kiss me
I'm dying just to see you again
Let's make tonight the best of our lives (yeah)

Close your eyes you'll be mine and it's all right
Take a breath no rest till the sunrise
Heartbeat so sweet when your lips touch mine
We don't have to go home right now
We're never gonna stop 'cause we're dreaming out loud
We know what we want, we know we're gonna get it somehow
Never say goodbye

So kiss me kiss me kiss me
And tell me that I'll see you again
'Cause I don't know if I can let you go
So kiss me kiss me kiss me
I'm dying just to see you again
Let's make tonight the best of our lives (yeah)
