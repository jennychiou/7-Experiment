Anytime, anywhere, any place
You could be anyone today
Maybe I will recognize you on a crowded street
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind?

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be Unmistakable?

People say to watch our life
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on
Holding out for me
Are we gonna know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be Unmistakable?

How can I know a song I've never heard?
How will I know your voice when you haven't said a word?
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin?
(Before we begin?)

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for?
Will you be?

Will you be Unmistakable?
Unmistakable
