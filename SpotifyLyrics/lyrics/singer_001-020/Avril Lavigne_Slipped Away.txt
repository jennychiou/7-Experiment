I miss you
Miss you so bad

I don't forget you
Oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day
You slipped away
Was the day
I found it won't be the same
Oh

I didn't get around to kiss you
Good-bye on the hand

I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't
Oh-Oh-Oh, I hope you can hear me
'Cause I remember it clearly

The day
You slipped away
Was the day
I found it won't be the same
Oh

I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up?
I keep asking why (I keep asking why)

And I can't take it
It wasn't fake it
It happened you passed by

Now you're gone now you're gone
There you go there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back

Now you're gone now you're gone
There you go there you go
Somewhere you're not coming back

The day
You slipped away
Was the day
I found it won't be the same
No

The day
You slipped away (na-na-na)
Was the day
That I found it won't be the same
Oh

I miss you
