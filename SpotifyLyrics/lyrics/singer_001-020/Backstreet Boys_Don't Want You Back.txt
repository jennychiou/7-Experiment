Don't... don't want you back

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, all right
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed babe

But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't... don't want you back

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize (realize)
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

(Back a no no!)
I, I don't want you back

That's right

Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't want you back
That's all I know
Don't want you back
All I can say
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know (don't want you back x2)
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back
