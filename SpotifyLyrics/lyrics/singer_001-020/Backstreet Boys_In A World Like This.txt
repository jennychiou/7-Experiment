You've got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm yours
You found me heartbroken, heartbroken
On the floor
Became my salvation, salvation
Through the war, yeah
You got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm sure

In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we gotta take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this, I've got you

And now I'm free falling, free falling
In your eyes
You got me still calling, still calling
No surprise
I never knew I could love 'til the
End of time, yeah
And now I'm free falling, free falling
By your side

In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we gotta take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this, I've got you

Ah, yeah
Ah, In a world like this

You got me wide open, wide open, yeah
And now I'm free falling, free falling
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
In a world like, in a world like
'Cause I got you in a world like this

In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we gotta take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this, I've got you
