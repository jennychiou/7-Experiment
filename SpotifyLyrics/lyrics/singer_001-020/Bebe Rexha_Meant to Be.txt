Baby lay on back and relax, kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast, let's enjoy right here where we at
Who knows where this road supposed to lead?
We got nothing but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be

I don't need to be so uptight, but my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gonna lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love, show me what you're made of
Boy make me believe
(But hold up girl don't you know you're beautiful?)
(And it's easy to see)

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be

(Maybe we do)
Maybe we don't
(Maybe we will)
Maybe we won't

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be
