Girl, I know what you're thinkin'
You need some answers in your heart tonight
Girl, I'm here, to make it different
It's the precious sweetin' of you life

Let your hair down
Let your guard down
Let me show you everything you've been missin'
Let it all go
Girl, you gotta let it flow
Don't let the door close
I know I can get you better

You need some sugar,
You're only human baby
Let me bring it on to you tonight
I'll be your sugar
I'm gonna make it easy
Smooth it out, and make it feel so right

Right
Right

Girl, love doesn't have to be
A bitter pill for you, time and again
Girl, take a look at the big picture
There's a new start here in my hand

Let your hair down
Let your guard down
Let me show you everything
You've been missing
Let it all go
Girl, you gotta let it flow
Don't let the door close
I know I can get you better


Going through it
I come to you
Just a kiss
Is good for you
I'm not leavin'
You this way
That's why you hear me say
