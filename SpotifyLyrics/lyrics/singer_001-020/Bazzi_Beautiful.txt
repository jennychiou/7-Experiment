Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else said I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that dress fall off you is amazing
You're a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful (yeah)
