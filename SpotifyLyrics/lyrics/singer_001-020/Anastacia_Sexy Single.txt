All my life I've tried to find
A love to give me piece of mind
And I, I looked into your eyes
Captivated by your wicked smile
I was mesmerized there
For a while or two
But what's a girl gonna do?

Oh I lay in my bed
With your stupid face in my head
Just another piece in my life
Now I'm a sexy single
Sexy single that's OK
I'm living on my own
And I'm feeling the way I do
Like a sexy single
Sexy single

Birds of a feather
We flock together
Like leaves on a tree
We were meant to be in love
I guess it was just a dream

Oh I lay in my bed
With your stupid face in my head
Just another piece in my life
Sexy single
Sexy single that's OK
I'm living on my own in my special way
Like a sexy single
Sexy single
I'm sexy single
Sexy single
Sexy single

I said I'm living on my own
And feeling the way I do
When I'm not with you

I said I'm sexy single
That's OK
Living on my own
And feeling the way I do
I said when I'm not with you

Sexy single that's OK
I'm living on my own in my special way
Like a sexy single
Sexy single
