I called your number 'bout a hundred times
And I know, that you know that it's me
I sat and listened for hours and hours
When the world got you down on your knees

All that I wanna do is to hold you tight
Love you until you're back on your feet
But it's hard when I'm laying my heart in your hands
And you don't hand yours back to me

Just give me something
I don't need it all, but you're giving nothin'
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothin'
Just give me somethin'

I left you flowers outside your door
I see 'em dyin', it's killing me
Feel like a man on a walkin' wire
'Cause every chance you get, you're pushin' me

You can break every bone, I'm still standin' here
Waiting 'til you can finally see
You know all that we had, it was magic
Now tragically, I'm begging you please, oh

Just give me something
I don't need it all, but you're giving nothin'
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing
Just give me something
Just give me something
Oh, just give me something
Oh, just give me something

I don't know how many nights
I can sit here waiting for you to come home

Just give me something
I don't need it all but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing

Just give me something
I don't need it all but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing
Just give me something
Just give me something
Oh just give me something
Oh just give me something
