A place
Where space
And time
Doesn't exist
Just us

I had a dream about you last night
Your eyes were shining so bright
Those lips and that bittersweet smile
I need this forever
Beautiful dream, yeah, yeah
Don't know what it means, yeah, yeah
All I know is I don't know
But I need this forever

Straight up out a dream
Like a magazine
Girl, it felt good with your body on me
We should never ever leave the sheets, yeah
We could stay forever underneath, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's like déjà vu when my hands up on you, like
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I might be naive, but you're more than a dream, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You made me feel alive, got me two times five, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dreamin' all about you

You give me feelings that I can't explain to you
Girl, I was cold for a while, now I'm something new
Tell me what you want, anything at all, I got it though
Swear to God we unstoppable, yeah
