Usually this shit don't work
'Cause all I ever do is put me first, yeah
But now you got me in reverse
'Cause all you ever do is prove my worth

You're the best I ever wanted in the worst way
Lick the icing off the cake like it's your birthday
Now I'm putting Carter right after your first name
Did you hear me? Yeah

It's a good thing I came out alive when I did
And it was bad, but I don't got no regret
'Cause you're the good, the good that came out of it
I guess, I guess that now I'm going back to good

Is it bad to be too good, is it bad
That you're good, baby, way too good at that
What you got, baby, now, I'm not used to that
I'm all good, going back to good, yeah
Back to good, yeah
Ba-ba-back to good, yeah
Back to good, yeah
Ba-ba-back to good, yeah

No money, it don't do 'nough
The feelings that I get, I won't discuss, but
It's different when it comes to us
I'm cool with saying less, than way too much

You're fucking up my rubber in the best way
Brought me back to life, but girl, your body's deadly
I want candy and you'll get it good and plenty
Did you hear me? Yeah

It's a good thing I came out of love when I did
And it was bad, but I know that, no regret
'Cause you're the good, the good that came out of it
I guess, I guess that now I'm going back to good

Is it bad to be too good, is it bad
That you're good, baby, way too good at that
What you got, baby, now, I'm not used to that
I'm all good, going back to good, yeah
Back to good, yeah
Ba-ba-back to good, yeah
Back to good, yeah
Ba-ba-back to good, yeah

Who better, who better to know?
The good and the bad 'cause I've done it all before
Who better, who better to know?

It's a good thing I came out of love when I did
And it was bad, but I know that, no regret
'Cause you're the good, the good that came out of it
I guess, I guess that now I'm going back to good

Is it bad to be too good, is it bad
That you're good, baby, way too good at that
What you got, baby, now, I'm not used to that
I'm all good, going back to good, yeah
