I met myself a cowgirl
Whacha want, put me on

Okay, this is
How it went down
Sunday afternoon with the fellas
At the play ground
Chillin', my father honked
His horn at me
Said I have a show in Texas
And I gotta leave
Texas, wow I've never been


Maybe I can find
A new hang out friend
Anyway, packin' up
My bags on my way
Signing autographs as
I run to catch the plane
I seen her, chubby
Cheeks with long braids
Cute face, the same age
She played hard to get
As I offered out my name
She just walked away
With a smile

My little cowgirl
