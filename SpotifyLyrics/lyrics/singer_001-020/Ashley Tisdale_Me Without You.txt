It's just you and me and there's no one around
I feel like I'm hanging by a thread, it's a long way down
I've been trying to breathe, but I'm fighting for air
I'm at an all time low with no place to go

But you're always there when everything falls apart
And it seems like the world is crashing at my feet
You like me the best, when I'm a mess
When I'm my own worst enemy

You make me feel beautiful
When I have nothing left to prove
And I can't imagine how I'd make it through

There's no me without you
No me without you, no no

You hear what I say, when I don't say a word
You are my rising sun, you're the place I run

You know how it hurts when everything falls apart
And it seems like the world is crashing at my feet
You like me the best, when I'm a mess
When I'm my own worst enemy

You make me feel beautiful
When I have nothing left to prove
And I can't imagine how I'd make it through

There's no me without you
No me without you
There's no me without you
No me without you

And when you say baby it's gonna get better, I believe you
And I wish that somehow I could see me though what you do
With my imperfections, you think I'm perfect
When it's not easy, you make it worth it

When everything falls apart
And it seems like the world is crashing at my feet
You like me the best, when I'm a mess
When I'm my own worst enemy

You make me feel beautiful
When I have nothing left to prove
And I can't imagine how I'd make it through

There's no me without you
No me without you, no no

No me without you
No me without you, no no no
