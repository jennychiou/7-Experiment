Set your clock back
Looking at the map
Wondering where you be at
'Cause it's so bad when you're not around
You're never around
It used to be you and me
Holding hands, smoldering
Picking up leafs
Talking about getting older
But now you're not around

You'll never be a rhyme or reason
For when it rolls around to this season
When all the leafs start their turning
And you start to burn again in my brain

I'm falling for you, I'm falling
I can't forget you
Now it's cold and all of the leafs
On all of the trees are falling with me
Down to the ground
And I'm falling for you

You're like a good book
Snuggled up on the sofa
When it's raining outside
But I'm warm 'cause I feel you around
But you're so out of town
I kinda wanna call
But I bet that you're busy
With that fancy new job
And the fall won't affect you
Like how it makes me feel now

October is so overwhelming
And all of my friends they tell me
November it should get better
But I still see you all over the place

I'm falling for you, I'm falling
I can't forget you
Now it's cold and all of the leafs
On all of the trees are falling with me
Down to the ground
And I'm falling, I'm falling

Oh you are like sunshine
With a chance of rain
I love the cool crisp air
And I don't care if you're near
'Cause I feel you like you're here
You're everywhere

I'm falling for you, I'm falling
I can't forget you
Now it's cold and all of the leafs
On all of the trees are falling with me
Down to the ground
And I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for you
