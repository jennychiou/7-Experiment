So hot out the box
Can we pick up the pace?
Turn it up, heat it up
I need to be entertained
Push the limit, are you with it, baby don't be afraid
Imma hurt you real good baby

Let's go, it's my show, baby, do what I say
Don't trip off the glitz that I'm gonna display
I told you, Imma hold ya down until you're amazed
Give it to ya till you're screamin' my name

No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way to ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

Do you know what you got into
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

'Sall right
You'll be fine
Baby I'm in control
Take the pain
Take the pleasure
I'm the master of both
Close your eyes, not your mind
Let me into your soul
I'm gonna work it till you're totally blown

No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way to ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

Do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

"Oh oh, entertainment"
"Oh oh, entertainment"
"Oh oh, entertainment"
I'm here for your entertainment

Do you like what you see?
Let me entertain ya 'til you scream

Do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment
