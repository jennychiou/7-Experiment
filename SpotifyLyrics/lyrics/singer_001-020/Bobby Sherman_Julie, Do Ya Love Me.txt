Bein' alone at night makes me sad, girl 
Yeah, it brings me down all right 
Tossin' and turnin' and freezin' and burnin' 
And cryin' all through the night 

Whoa-oh 
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me? 
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care? 
Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me? 
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there? 

We had so much fun together 
I was sure that you were mine 
But leavin' you, baby, is drivin' me crazy 
It's got me wonderin' all the time 

Whoa-oh 
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me? 
Ah, Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care? 
Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me? 
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there? 

Honey, you cried the day I left you 
Even though we knew I couldn't stay 
But baby, remember, I'll be back September 
But till then I'll write you every day 

Whoa-oh 
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me? 
Ah, Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care? 
Come on, Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me? 
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there? 

Oh-oh 
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me? 
Ah, Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care? 
Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me? 
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there?
