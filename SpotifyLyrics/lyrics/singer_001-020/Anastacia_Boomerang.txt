I've made my share of dumb mistakes
And I've had to learn the hard way
What comes around goes around
I've played with fire enough to know
I don't want any more doors to close
It's my choice gonna use my voice
With so much chaos everywhere
And life's not perfect, life's not fair
You can do what you can only do
I've been around enough to see
What really matter most to me
Is the smile on your face. Making the world a better place

Life is what you make of it. You live and you learn
Whatever you throw into it, you get in return
Like a boomerang, like a boomerang
Like a boomerang, boomerang

Not trying to get all mystical
But there's one thing, it's spiritual
You can't deny, wonder why
Put out shit that's what you find
Put out love, get peace of mind
Don't play no fool, such simple rules
I've played with fire enough to know
I don't want any more doors to close
It's my choice gonna use my voice

Life is what you make of it. You live and you learn
Whatever you throw into it, you get in return
Like a boomerang, like a boomerang
Like a boomerang, boomerang

I dig deeper in my soul
Gonna find the way. Gonna find the gold

Took a little while for me to see
Just what the boomerang means to me
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Life is what you make of it. You live and you learn
Whatever you throw into it, you get in return
Like a boomerang, like a boomerang
Like a boomerang, boomerang

Boomerang
Boomerang
Boomerang
Yeah c'mon
