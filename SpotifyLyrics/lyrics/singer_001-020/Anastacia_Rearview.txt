Oh... Oh...

I use to tell myself that you would wait
I borrowed time for two and I twisted fate
I left us floating in the air for wind to hold on to
It let me down it let you go

I drive around like everything's okay
And I feel the lightening in our own mistakes
And I was gonna tell you
I wish all our wrongs could be right
I'm too late
I looked in my rearview
And now I don't see you

Sometimes the things you want are hard to take
Sometimes the ones you love are risks you don't make, yeah
The dust has settled into nothingness
And I yearn for yesterday
Just look around
I'm still the same

I drive around like everything's okay
Like everything's okay
And I feel the lightening in our own mistakes
And I was gonna tell you
I wish all our wrongs could be right
I'm too late
I looked in my rearview
And now I don't see you

So many things that we didn't say
So many reasons the world's not the same
Oh, it's not the same

I drive around like nothing's here has changed
But I know the sky has one more cloud to break
And I was gonna tell you
I wish all our wrongs could be right
I'm too late
I looked in my rearview
And now I don't see you

I said I
I drive and everything has changed
Oh...
And I feel the lightening it's in my own mistakes
And I was gonna tell you
I wish all our wrongs could be right
I'm too late
I looked in my rearview
And now I don't see you

I used to tell myself
That you
Would wait
