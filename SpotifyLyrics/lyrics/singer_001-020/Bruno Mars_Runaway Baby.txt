Ah yes
Well look at here, look at here
Ah, what do we have? Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night it is her I'll be holding

I love you so (hey)
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
You tell me baby, baby please don't go away (don't go away)
But when I play (when I play)
I never stay (I never stay)
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway baby before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway darling 'cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway baby

Uh
Ah yeah
Well, let me think let me think, ah what should I do?
So many eager young bunnys that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

I love you so (hey)
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
You tell me baby, baby please don't go away (don't go away)
But when I play (when I play)
I never stay (I never stay)
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway baby before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway baby

Uh
Chicka ah

See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No, no, no I just wanna work you baby
Yup yup
See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No, no, no I just wanna work you baby
If you scared you better run
(You better run)
You better run
(You better run)
You better run
(You better run)
You better, you better, you better

Run, run, runaway, runaway baby before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway baby
