When the stars are too cold
Frozen all over the globe
On the edge of the night
We can be their light.
So give me more than your touch
And give yourself to the rush
Just keep holding my hand
As we're taking off
I know where we'll land
We can escape to a higher plane
In nirvana state
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana state.
Where the dreamers lay,
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Through the dark there's a way
There's a love, there's a place
Where we don't have to hide
We can dream all night.
So follow me through the sky
And watch the oceans collide
Just keep holding my hand,
As we're taking off
I know where we'll land
We can escape to a higher plane
In nirvana state
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana state.
Where the dreamers lay,
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Phh, we don't need any diamonds or gold
Watch the mystic encryptic enfold
As we fly higher
We can escape to a higher plane
In nirvana state
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana state.
Where the dreamers lay,
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Yeah, I'll lay you down, lay you down
I'll lay you down, lay you down
