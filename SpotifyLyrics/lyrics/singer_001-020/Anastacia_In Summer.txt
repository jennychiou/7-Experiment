I wish there could be more days in summer
I wish that autumn wouldn't come so soon
'Cause when the sun goes away
I'm left in the shade

I wish that you could warm me in the winter
They say springtime is so beautiful
But I see nothing but rain
And short windy days

And I only feel safe
When your arms are wrapped around me

So forget the clouds
I don't feel the rain
Even thought the four seasons may change
I see the sun when I hear your name
You give me a reason, a reason to start again

I love to see the leaves fall in September
And the snow drops in December just the same
But it leaves me in a daze
Can't wait to see your face

And I only feel safe
When you're arms are wrapped around me

So forget the clouds
I don't feel the rain
Even thought the four seasons may change
I see the sun when I hear your name
You give me a reason, a reason to start again

All through the year
Long after sunny days have gone away
You shine your rays on me

So forget the clouds
I don't feel the rain
Even thought the four seasons may change
I see the sun when I hear your name
You give me a reason, a reason to start again
