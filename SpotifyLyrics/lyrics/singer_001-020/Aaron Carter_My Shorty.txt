Hey girl
Keep your head high
I never said I
Wouldn't be back when I'm
Leaving all the red hots

Gotta do this show so I can get my dough
Bumped in there low with you and I
Hookin' up at the house on the top of the hill
Where we can drop and get ill
A better spot we can chill
We'll hide out whenever things get real
Shorty, wontcha tell me how ya feel
If I will
How can I be sure
If you're lovin' me too
Well, I gotta go
Until we get this gig
Ya just gotta know
When you're not there wit' me sometimes
No matter what I try it, it won't go right

My Shorty
'Cause you got my back
My Shorty
We keep it real like that
My Shorty
I wanna be red hot
My Shorty
That's why I'm gettin' like that

Shorty ain't around
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
Shorty ain't around
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me

Onto a two month 8 weeks 60 days later
I laid so many groupies off
One I even made her cry
I had to tell her I really didn't hit her right
Couldn't lay out why
'Cause we had to say goodbye
I never thought that I
Would never see that day that I
Fall for her the way that I did
So I will say that I
Never straight 'cause I found out better women
I hold it down and keep it tight
I could never say goodbye

My Shorty
'Cause you got my back
My Shorty
We keep it real like that
My Shorty
I wanna be red hot
My Shorty
That's why I'm gettin' like that

Shorty ain't around
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
Shortyin' around
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me

My shorty... My shorty... Baby, girl

My shorty... My shorty... Baby, ooh

Shortyin' around
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
Shortyin' around
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me

Shorty ain't around
(My shorty baby I...)
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
(Repeat until fade)
