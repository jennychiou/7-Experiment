Little ghost, you are listening
Unlike most you don't miss a thing
You see the truth
I walk the halls invisibly
I climb the walls, no one sees me
No one but you

You've always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wings still beating,
You've always loved the stranger inside...
Me, ugly pretty.

Oh no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no

Oh little ghost, you see the pain
But together we can make something beautiful
So take my hand and perfectly
We fill the gaps, you and me make three
I was meant for you, and you for me

You've always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wings still beating
You've always loved the stranger inside...
Me, ugly pretty

Oh no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no

You've always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wings still beating
You've always loved the stranger inside...
Me, ugly pretty
