"spoken:"
You can say what you want about me
Try to do what you want to me
But you can not stop me

I've been knocked down
It's a crazy town
Even got punched in the face in LA
Ain't nothing in the world that you keep me from doing what I wanna do

'Cause I'm too proud, I'm too strong
Live by the code that you gotta move on
Feeling sorry for yourself
Ain't got nobody nowhere

So I...
(Held my head high)
I Knew I (Knew I'd survive)
Well I made it (I made it)
Don't hate it (Don't hate it)
That's just the way it goes
Yeah
I done made it through
Stand on my own two
I paid my dues, yeah
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues

"spoken:"
So, like I told you
You cannot stop me
I paid my dues

Now I'm still tested every day
And people try to mess with Anastacia
Got another thing comin'
'Cause I have a mind
And I thought I better let you know

I'm no punk I can get down
I don't give a damn about who's around
That was just fine till now

So I...
(Held my head high)
Knew I (Knew I'd survive)
Well, I made it (I made it)
Oah (Don't hate it)
That's just the way it goes
Yeah
I done made it through
Stand on my own two
I paid my dues
Yeah, yeah
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Took so long to get me here
But I won't live in fear
You try to steal my shine
But first they wanna build you up
Then they tear you down
It's a struggle, you try to bubble

So I...
(Held my head high)
Knew I (Knew I'd survive)
Oah (I made it)
(Don't hate it)
Said that's just the way

(I done made it through)
(Stand on my own two)
I said I paid my, I paid my dues
Yeah
(Tried to hold me down)
But you can't stop me now (you can't stop me now)
(I paid my dues) I paid my, paid my dues
(I done made it through) oah
(Stand on my own two) oh
(I paid my dues) I paid my, I paid my dues
Yeah
(Tried to hold me down)
But you can't stop me now (you can't stop me now)
(I paid my dues) I paid my dues
