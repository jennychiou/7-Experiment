<So empty, can't feel no more,
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
I wait for my heart to mend,
But you keep tearing a hole

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered,
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(Felt) it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

What am I still here for,
Could it be that I'm just waiting
Hoping you'd rescue me,
And put the pieces together again

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(Felt it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Tell me what you're really here for,
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough

'Cause all you had to say was that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, oh-ho

You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up,
And move on with life, again
And now I'm shattered (Ooh)
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(Felt it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh
So shattered

Can't believe, you and me, ah
