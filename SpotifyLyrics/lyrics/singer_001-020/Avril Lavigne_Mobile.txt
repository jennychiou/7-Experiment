Went back home again
This sucks, gotta pack up and leave again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Can't say when I'll be there again
Its time now, I turn around
Turn my back on, everything
(Turn my back on), everything

Everything's changing, when I turn around
All out of my control
I'm a mobile
Everything's changing, when I turn around
All out of my control
I'm a mobile
Hmmm... yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah...)

Start back at this life
Stretch myself back into the vibe
I'm waking up to say I've tried
Instead of waking up to another TV guide
Its time now, I turn around
Turn and walk on this crazy ground, 'ound, 'ound, 'ound...

Everything's changing, when I turn around
All out of my control
I'm a mobile
Everything's changing
Out of what I know
Everywhere I go
I'm a mobile
I'm a mobile

Hanging from the ceiling
Life's a mobile
Spin around with mixed feelings
Crazy and wild
Sometimes I wanna scream out loud

Everything's, changing everywhere I go
All out of my control
Everything's changing everywhere I go
Out of what I know
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah

La-la-la-la-la-la la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (la)
La-la-la-la-la

Everything's changing, when I turn around
All out of my control
I'm a mobile
Everything's changing
Out of what I know
Every where I go
I'm a mobile
Everywhere I go
I'm a mobile
