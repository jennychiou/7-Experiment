I'm tuggin' at my hair
I'm pullin' at my clothes
I'm tryin' to keep my cool
I know it shows
I'm starin' at my feet
My cheeks are turnin' red
I'm searchin' for the words inside my head
And I'm feelin' nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishin' my life away
With these things I'll never say

It don't do me any good
It's just a waste of time
What use is it to you?
What's on my mind
If it ain't comin' out
We're not goin' anywhere
So why can't I just
Tell you that I care?
'Cause I'm feelin' nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezin' you too tight?
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishin' my life away
With these things I'll never say

What's wrong with my tongue
These words keep slippin' away
I stutter, I stumble
Like I've got nothin' to say
'Cause I'm feelin' nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezin' you too tight?
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishin' my life away
With these things I'll never say
These things I'll never say
