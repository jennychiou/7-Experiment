Well, I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying: Who are you and where are you from
We don't like when visitors come
No trespassing that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
No Trespassers yeah, my ass
Wait 'til ya get a load of me

One day I was trippin'
And that's when I could see
That the ether that I tapped into
Could be reality
It was great, that's when I climbed that optimistic vine
Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind

I don't need no sympathy, I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty and I shine when I wanna shine
Make their faces crack
There's no turning back
Let's Go!

I ain't got B.S. in my bag
That's the one thing you can believe
My heart is gold, my body is glass
C'mon baby, can't u see
I don't need no GPS
To show me where to go
But I can turn into the North Pole
And I'll show you what is cold

I don't need no sympathy, I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty and I shine when I wanna shine
Make their faces crack (crack)
There's no turning back

Let's Go!

Wait 'til ya get a load of me
I said wait 'til ya get a load of me

I ain't stayin' at home
I got places to roll
I ain't stayin' at home

I don't need no sympathy, I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty and I shine when I wanna shine

Let's Go!
