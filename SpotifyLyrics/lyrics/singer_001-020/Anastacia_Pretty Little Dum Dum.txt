Floating in a circle of illusion and deceit 
Drifting far beneath the skin 
The taste of bitter sweet 
Giving into fantasies 
Playing every part 
It's hard to break away from what 
He says you are 

He Calls you pretty little dum dum 
He says he loves you but he lies 
He says that you're the one one 
But that's eleven in his eyes 
Whatever happens from one through ten 
Don't be a victim of his past tense 
Pretty little one one don't be a pretty little dum dum 

A never ending silence 
In a never ending sleep 
Walking through the darkness 
Complicated melodies 
Praying for a change of heart 
And looking for a sign 
It's hard to find the love you want 
In broken time 

He Calls you pretty little dum dum 
He says he loves you but he lies 
He says that you're the one one 
But that's eleven in his eyes 
Whatever happens from one through ten 
Don't be a victim of his past tense 
Pretty little one one don't be a pretty little dum dum 

It's hard to be what you wanna be 
And you wanted to be the one 
But you know that you have to run 
Your life's incomplete 
It's so bittersweet 
And you wanted to be the one 
But you know that you have to run 
It's hard to be what you want to be 

He Calls you pretty little dum dum 
He says he loves you but he lies 
He says that you're the one one 
But that's eleven in his eyes 
Whatever happens from one through ten 
Don't be a victim of his past tense 
Pretty little one one don't be a pretty little dum dum
