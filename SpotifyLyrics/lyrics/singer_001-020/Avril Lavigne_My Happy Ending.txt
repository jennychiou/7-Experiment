So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending

Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?

Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread (Breakable thread)

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything
That I wanted (I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it (We lost it)
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

So much for my happy ending

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say (I know what they say)
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they (But so are they)

But they don't know me
Do they even know you? (Even know you?)
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do (All the shit that you do)

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything
That I wanted (I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it (We lost it)
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one

It's nice to know we had it all!
Thanks for watching as I fall!
And letting me know we were done!

He was everything, everything
That I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of the memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy
