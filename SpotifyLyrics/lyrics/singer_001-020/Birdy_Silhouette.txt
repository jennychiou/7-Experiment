There are shadows in my dreams
Storms that send me out of reach
And you just wait on my defeat
So I built an army underneath
And now they guard me while I sleep
This worn-out frame will carry me

Don't go holding your breath
You know that I'm not done yet
There's still a fight in me left
Don't go shouting out loud
That you're claiming the crown
I'm down but not out

And the bittersweet of every new defeat
Is I'm stronger than before
May be on my knees, but I still believe
These broken wings will soar

Untie my silhouette, 
It's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks
Through oceans dark

In the dust, I wrote my name
And from the ruins, hopes were raised
'Cause all that's lost
Can be replaced in time

Don't go holding your breath
You know that I'm not done yet
There's still a fight in me left
Don't go shouting out loud
That you're claiming the crown
I'm down but not out

And the bittersweet of every new defeat
Is I'm stronger than before
May be on my knees, but I still believe
These broken wings will soar

Untie my silhouette, 
It's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks
Through oceans dark

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Untie my silhouette
It's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks
Through oceans dark
