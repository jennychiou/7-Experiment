Turn that music way down low
We'll take it nice and slow
I'll play it for you, just like you like it
Oh, we're two shadows in the dark
Nothing between us but a spark
I'll light this night up just like you like it

Girl, it's all for you, everything I do
You just set the groove
I'll pour it on, strong and smooth
We've got all night long
So, tell me what you want
I'm gonna love you just like you like it

Oh, just like you like it

I'll brush that hair back off your face
Girl, let my fingers trace all over you
Just like you like it
You breathe my name, I feel the heat
Now we're on fire in these sheets
'Cause I'm burning for you, just like you like it

Girl, it's all for you, everything I do
You just set the groove
I'll pour it on, strong and smooth
We've got all night long
So, tell me what you want
I'm gonna love you just like you like it

Just like you like it
Oh, just like you like it
Just like you like it

I can feel you want to
In the air, in the air, in the air
I know where you're going
I'ma get you there, get you there, get you there

Girl, it's all for you, everything I do
You just set the groove
I'll pour it on, strong and smooth
We've got all night long
So, tell me what you want
I'm gonna love you just like you like it

Just like you like it
Just like you like
Just like you like it
Just like you like it
Just like you like it
Just like you like it
Just like you like it, just like you like it
Just like you like it, oh, just like you like it
Just like you like it, you like it
Just like you like it

Just like you like it, oh, just like you like it
Just like you like it, oh, just like you like it
Just like you like it, just like you like it
