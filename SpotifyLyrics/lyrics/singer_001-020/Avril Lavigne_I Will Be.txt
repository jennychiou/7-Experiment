There's nothing I can say to you
Nothing I could ever do, to make you see
What you mean to me
All the pain, the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye, and now I know how far you'd go

I know I let you down, but it's not like that now
This time I'll never let you go

I will be all that you want, and get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day and make everything okay

I thought that I had everything
I didn't know what life could bring
But now I see honestly
You're the one thing I got right
The only one I let inside
Now I can breathe 'cause you're here with me

And if I let you down, I'll turn it all around
'Cause I would never let you go

I will be all that you want and get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day, and make everything okay

'Cause without you I can't sleep
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave
You're all I got
You're all I want
Yeah
And without you I don't know what I'll do
I could never ever live a day without you
Here with me, do you see, you're all I need?

And I will be all that you want and get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life (my life) I will be with you forever
To get you through the day, and make everything okay

I will be (I'll be) all that you want and get myself together
Cause you keep me from falling apart
And all my life, you know I will be with you forever
To get you through the day, and make everything okay
