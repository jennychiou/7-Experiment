First off I can't keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
To scared to return your calls

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala

Its known that I'm a liar
Often I'm blacker than white
Add on my uncanny ego
No one's less humbled than I

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala

All the messed up things I do
Yeah I swear I'll make'em up to you
Before you're going heaven knows
Just let me make it better
I'll try to measure up
I'll try to measure up to you

I'll make it up to you

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
'Cause you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala
