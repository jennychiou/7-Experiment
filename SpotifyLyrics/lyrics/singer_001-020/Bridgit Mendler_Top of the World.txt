You got that fresh way of talking
It could be four in the morning
And you're making me trip
My heart skip, skip the beat
You know that this is amazing
Please tell me why you're hesitating
Let's risk it all, risk the fall tonight

Take the rope and climb
Close your eyes
Love will take you high
We'll be sitting on top of the world
Baby, you and I were born to rise
So just hold on tight
We'll be sitting on top
Sitting on top of the world

Ooh ooh
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh

I hear the wind in the trees
And I'm weak in the knees
When you're holding me close
Got tingling toes tonight
You got me so elevated
You wanna jump
Why you waiting?
Let's risk it all, risk the fall tonight

Take the rope and climb
Close your eyes
Love will take you high
We'll be sitting on top of the world
Baby, you and I were born to rise
So just hold on tight
We'll be sitting on top
Sitting on top of the world

Ooh ooh
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh

I'm begging you, begging you
Got my loving hand out
I'm begging you, begging you
Got my loving hand out
I'm begging you, begging you
Got my loving hand out
Begging you, begging you
Begging you, begging you

Take the rope and climb
Close your eyes
Hold on tight
We'll be sitting on top of the world
Baby, you and I were born to rise
So just hold on tight
We'll be sitting on top
Sitting on top of the world

Take the rope and climb
Close your eyes
Love will take you high
We'll be sitting on top of the world
Baby, you and I were born to rise
So just hold on tight
We'll be sitting on top
Sitting on top of the world

Ooh ooh
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh

Sitting on top of the world
We will be, you and me
We will be sitting on top of the world
