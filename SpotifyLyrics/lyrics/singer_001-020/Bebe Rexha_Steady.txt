"'Bebe Rexha"'
Something 'bout a rapper, something 'bout a singer
Tryna make a feeling last longer than a linger
They knew exactly what they were getting into
He was always sipping, she was something different
Together they were living, never, ever overthinking
Falling in madly, running from their issues
And he's not to blame, and she's not to blame
Drinking the love that they pour in the cup 'cause it eases the pain
And he'll never change, she'll never change
Breathing the hope that they find in the smoke 'cause it eases the pain

We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our heads get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady

When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady

Tory
I pulled up on you last night
I didn't know what to do last night
Pulling on you, put me to my knees, baby
I was on the D, R, U and Gs, baby
Keep it G, baby
I've been way up, honey, way up
You know what it it is, whenever I come through the Cajun
And you say you get this feeling with me, baby, on the real
I get the same feeling with you, I know how you feel
I said, keep it G with me
'Cause this what I'mma do with you
I'ma keep it 78 plus 22 with you
You know what it is when I pull up in that new, new thang
Looking for a new thang, ah

We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our heads get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady

When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady

We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh
We only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our heads get messy
We only laugh
Only attach when the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
Wish we could love
Sober the buzz but I'm just not steady
