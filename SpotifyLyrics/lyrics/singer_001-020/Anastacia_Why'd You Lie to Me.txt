Why'd you lie to me
You can't be trusted good for nothin' type of brother
Everything you claim to be was a lie... lie
Why'd you lie to me
You'd been creeping, sneaking, sleeping with another
Messed up it's time to leave so bye... bye

You used to treat me like a queen
Said I was your everything
Promised me that you would never cheat on me
But I found a number on the floor
And I won't take it no more
Made me feel so crazy
Thinking you'd be true to me yeah
(Tell me baby) Did you really think that
(I would maybe) I turn the other cheek and
(Let you play me) I thought you were different,
But you're like the rest
It's true!

Why'd you lie to me
You can't be trusted good for nothin' type of brother
Everything you claim to be was a lie... lie
Why'd you lie to me
You'd been creeping, sneaking, sleeping with another
Messed up it's time to leave so bye... bye

Woah, last time you played me like a fool
Now it's time I lose my cool
Ain't no way you'll ever get another chance
Why do you just claim to be so true
When I gave my world to you
All you wanna do is hang out on the edge of the line
(Tell me baby) Did you really think that
(I would maybe) I turn the other cheek and
(Let you play me) But I flipped it up for you

Why'd you lie to me
You can't be trusted good for nothin' type of brother
Everything you claim to be was a lie... lie
Why'd you lie to me
You'd been creeping, sneaking, sleeping with another
Messed up it's time to leave so bye... bye

(Tell me baby) Did you really think that
(I would maybe) I turn the other cheek -haha
(Let you feel me) Oh, but I flipped it up for you

Why'd you lie to me

Why'd you why'd you lie to me?!
