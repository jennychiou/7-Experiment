La la la, la la la la

I know your kind of girl
You only care about one thing
Who you've seen or where you've been
Who's got money

I see that look in your eyes
It tells a million lies
But deep inside I know why
You're talking to him

I know what you're all about
I really hope he figures it out

She's one of those girls
They're nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's so good that you won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothing
You'll be broke and she'll be gone
Off to the next one

Oh oh oh
Off to the next one

Oh oh yeah yeah oh oh

She's gonna be the end of you
At least that's what they say
It's been a while, you're in denial
And now it's too late

The way she looks makes you hide
All the warning signs
'Cause her blonde hair, her blue eyes
Makes you wanna die

I know what she's all about
I really hope you figure it out

She's one of those girls
They're nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's so good that you won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothing
You'll be broke and she'll be gone
Off to the next one

You know it's a game, you know it's a game
She keeps playing around with your head, playing around with your head
She's so insane, so insane
She's the one to blame, she's the one to blame

She's one of those girls
They're nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's so good that you won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothing
You'll be broke and she'll be gone
Off to the next one

Oh oh oh
Off to the next one
Oh oh yeah yeah
Off to the next one
