Ain't nobody else but you
Ain't nobody else but you

Ain't nobody else but you

There is nobody
Who can make me cry
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
(Ain't nobody else but you)
There is nobody who can make me lie
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
(Ain't nobody else but you)
Nobody, nobody but you

Give me one more chance to make it right
The time has come for us to reunite
Cause baby it's true
(Ain't nobody else but you)
There's no one like you

There is nobody
Who can make it right
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you
You know what to do
(Ain't nobody else but you)
Nobody
(Nobody)
Nobody, nobody but you

Somebody tell me
'Cause I can't eat or sleep
When you're not close to my body
You're a bittersweet delight
Come and help me through the night

Ain't nobody else can make me cry
Ain't nobody else can make me lie
Nobody but you
(Ain't nobody else but you)
(No one can make my lie)

Give me one more chance to make it right
The time has come for us to reunite
Cause baby it's true
(Ain't nobody else but you)
There's no one like you
