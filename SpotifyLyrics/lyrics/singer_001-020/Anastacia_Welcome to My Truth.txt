Sentimental days 

Sentimental days 
In a misty clouded haze 
Of a memory that now feels untrue 
I used to feel disguised 
Now I leave the mask behind 
Painting pictures that aren't so blue 
The pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned 

Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see 
(Don't You Feel Sorry For Me) 
My life turned around 
But I'm still living my dreams 
(Yes it's true I've been) 
I've been through it all 
I've hit about a million walls 
Welcome to my truth... I still love 
Welcome to my truth... I still love 

Tangled in a web 
With a pain hard to forget 
That was a time that I've now put to rest 
Oh, the pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned 

Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see 
(Don't You Feel Sorry For Me) 
My life turned around 
But I'm still living my dreams 
(Yes it's true I've been) 
I've been through it all 
I've hit about a million walls 
Welcome to my truth... I still love 
Welcome to my truth... I still love 

Sentimental days 
In a mist of clouded haze 
Of a memory that now feels untrue 

Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see 
(Don't You Feel Sorry For Me) 
My life turned around 
But I'm still living my dreams 
(Yes it's true I've been) 
I've been through it all 
I've hit about a million walls 
Welcome to my truth... I still love 
Welcome to my truth... I still love
