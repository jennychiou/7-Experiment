Please tell me what is takin' place
'Cause I can't seem to find a trace
Guess it must have got away somehow
Probably 'cause I always forget
Everytime someone tells me their name
It's always gotta be the same
(In My World)

Never wore cover up
Always beat the boys up
Grew up in a five thousand population town
Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by a fried chicken ass
All in a small town, NAPANEE

You know I always stay up without sleepin'
And think to myself
Where do I belong forever
In whose arms, the time and place

Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
Sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend
I'm off again in my World

I never spend less than an hour
Washin' my hair in the shower
It always takes five hours to make it straight
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids
So it may take a friggen day
There's nothing else better to do anyway

When you're all alone in the lands of forever
Lay under the milky way
On and on it's getting too late out
I'm not in love this time, this night

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
Sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend
I'm off again in my World

(La la la la)

Take some time
Mellow out
Party it up
Don't fall down
Don't get caught
Sneak out of the house

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
Sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not preten
I'm off again in my World

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
Sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not preten
I'm off again in my World
