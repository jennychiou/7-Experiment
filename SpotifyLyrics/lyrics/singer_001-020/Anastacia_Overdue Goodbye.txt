This is a message pay attention
I got somethin' to say, blessed information
This is me walking, that's you waving
It's my getaway my taste of freedom
Goodbye, Goodbye

This is a calling not a conversation
This is not a game no manipulation
If love is a season you are my winter
You are just the ice layin on my finger

This is a message pay attention
Nobodys gonna love me the wrong way again
This is a calling not a conversation
This is my overdue goodbye
(Yeh overdue goodbye)

Oh in my tomorrow all the fields are golden
And all the papers say that the spell has been broken
To my future lover fear will fight you
'Cause you'll have the power of truth behind you
Goodbye, Goodbye

This is a message pay attention
Nobodys gonna love me the wrong way again
This is a calling not a conversation
This is my overdue goodbye
Goodbye, Goodbye
(I sai goodbye, I said goodbye baby)

This is a message pay attention
Nobodys gonna love me the wrong way again
(Oh yeh)
This is a calling not a conversation
This is my overdue goodbye

This is a message pay attention
Nobodys gonna love me the wrong way again
(So pay attention)
Nobodys gonna love me the wrong way again
This is a calling not a conversation
(A calling)
This is my overdue goodbye
(Yeh)
Goodbye
Repeat until fade out
