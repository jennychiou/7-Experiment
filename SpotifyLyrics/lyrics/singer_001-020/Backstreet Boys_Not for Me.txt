I was looking for something
On a crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)
I got a little suspicious, I got a feeling
That you ain't true to me
I should have known better than to buy your lies (your sweet disguise)
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me, babe

No no uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no uh uh
And now I know what it's coming to
No no uh uh
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

I don't wanna be part of your screenplay
Just tell me did you rehearse on me?
Just give me the story
Baby who's to win? Me or him?
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of Hide and Seek
I'm getting the feeling that it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me, baby

No no uh uh (yeah yeah)
Things will never be the same again with you
No no uh uh (Oh)
And now I know what it's coming to
No no uh uh (yeah-eah)
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love, should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

Yeah, yeah
I said no, no
No way
No no, no no
No

I had enough of your talk, your games
And it won't go away (won't go away)
Justify my reasons to say (say... reasons to say)

No no uh uh
Let me hear you say No no
No no uh uh
No no, let me tell you it's not for me
I said No no
No no uh uh
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be
Well let me tell you it's not for me

No no uh uh (whoo)
Things will never be the same again with you
No no uh uh (baby)
And now I know what it's coming to
No no uh uh
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love, should be

Well let me tell you it's not for me
