I looked away
Then I look back at you
You try to say
Things that you can't undo

If I had my way
I'd never get over you
Today's the day
I pray that we make it through

Make it through the fall
Make it through it all

And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you

I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you

I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you

You're the only one
I'd be with till the end
When I come undone
You'd bring me back again

Back under the stars
Back into your arms

And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you

I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you

I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you

Wanna know who you are
Wanna know where to start
I wanna know what this means

Wanna know how you feel!
Wanna know what is real!
I wanna know everything, everything!

I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you

I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you

I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you

I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you

And I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
