Starting to believe you
All the things you've been through
I don't even want to
Knowing what the truth is
Hating what the truth is
Scared of what the truth is
You're right so I'm just gonna say it
I can feel your eyes are on me

This is my apology tonight
I don't wanna fight about it
This is my apology and I
I just wanna say I'm sorry
It's so hard, takes too long
When we both stay strong
Tryna keep this pain alive
Oh, can we let it be tonight?
Can we let it be tonight?

Looking for the reasons
I didn't need them
Free me from the treason
I wanna start it over
Can we start it over?
Let me start it over
You're right so I'm just gonna say it
And I hope these words set you free

This is my apology tonight
I don't wanna fight about it
This is my apology and I
I just wanna say I'm sorry
It's so hard, takes too long
When we both stay strong
Tryna keep this pain alive
Oh, can we let it be tonight?
Can we let it be tonight?

Oh, the truest words are never wasted
I'm letting go just show me how
I'm getting closer I can taste it
This time, our time

This is my apology tonight
I don't wanna fight about it
This is my apology and I
I just wanna say I'm sorry
