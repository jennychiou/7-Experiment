All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been livin' in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe

I don't feel safe, ooh

Left broken, empty, in despair
Wanna breathe, can't find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more I have to say
Help me find a way

And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone, to be left outside alone

I tell ya

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been livin' in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe
I need to pray

Why do you play me like a game?
Always someone else to blame
Careless, helpless little man
Someday I might understand
There's not much more to say
But I hope you find a way

Still I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone, to be left outside alone

I tell ya

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been livin' in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe
I need to pray

Oh, pray "(Heavenly Father)"
Oh "(Please)" Heavenly Father
"(Save me)" Oh, save me
Oh, oh

And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone, to be left outside alone

I said, I said, I wonder if you know how it feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone, to be left outside alone, oh

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been livin' in a fantasy without meaning, ooh
It's not okay, I don't feel safe
I need to pray
