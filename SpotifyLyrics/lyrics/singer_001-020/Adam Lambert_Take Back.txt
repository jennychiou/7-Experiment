All you ever think is gimme gimme but you never give back. Eh eh ay
All I ever do is overthink and drink until I attack. Eh eh ay
We know how to talk it into the ground
We know how to wear it out
If we ain't gon say that, gonna end up in a grave and baby
Eh eh, yeah
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said? Oh my
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die.
And I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done, what's been said? Ooh my!
I fed you a fantasy but you've been drunk on reality, eh eh ay
All you want is to be wanted, as long as you get it out of me, eh eh ay
We used to be a jungle, sticky and wild
It used to be we owned the night
All the stupid games we play
And all the shit that we've been sayin'
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said? Oh my
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die.
And I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done, what's been said? Ooh my!
Remember, remember the first time we collided
We lost it we lost it
Yeah!
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said? Oh my
How do we take back?
Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die.
And I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done, what's been said? Ooh my!
Oh my, how do we take back?
