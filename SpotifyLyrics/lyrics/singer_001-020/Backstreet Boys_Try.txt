Uh, uh I know that you're hurting now
Seems like there's just no way how
Feels like it's all gone wrong
You keep on sipping till you can't go on!

Don't worry, I'm not by your side
My shoulder is yours if you need to cry
Feel the times when life is just too much
I know you want to, but don't give up!

Try, baby try
Give me a moment of your time
Oh no, don't, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurt now
We can work it out
If we just try, if you just try!

It's always been just me and you
You know I've been down there, too!
Always when I needed you
You were strong!
Let me hold you, baby
When hope is gone!

Try, baby try
Give me a moment of your time
Oh no, don't, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurt now
We can work it out
If we just try, if you just try!

Holding on, holding on
We used to know how to!
Oh, oh, oh if the nights are so long
It's my favorite time if we just

Try, baby try
Give me a moment of your time
Oh no, don't, don't close your eyes
I know you're hurt now
We can work it out
If we just try, if you just try!
