Open up your heart to me
It say what's on your mind (oh yes)
I know we have been to so much pain,
But I still need you in my life this time...

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight

I figured out what to say to you (mmm..)
Sometimes the word, they, they come out so wrong (oh, yes they do)
And I know in time that you will understand
Then what we have is so right this time...

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right

All those endless times we tried to make it last forever more
And baby I know

I need you (oh oh... yeah..)
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you, oh... oh...

I need you tonight (I need you, I need you baby)
I need you right now (It's gotta be baby2x)
I know deep within my heart
No, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or it's right
All I know is baby
I really need you, tonight.
Oh...
