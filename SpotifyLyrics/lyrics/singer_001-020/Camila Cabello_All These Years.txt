Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (oh)
Your smile's just a little softer

And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, suddenly, it all came back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
(Oh yeah)

Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, suddenly, it all came back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years, oh
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (you are near)
And it was just a quick "hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years

I never told you, I should've told you
I never told you after all these years
Told you, I never told you
Told you, I never told you
I never told you after all these years
