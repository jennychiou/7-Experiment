Every minute, every hour I feel too far away
I am missing you all over and over again
You leave the lights some for me baby
Until I'm getting back home again
And you keep doing it all over and over

Wanna know how I'm on my own
Rocking the cities, New York to Rome
Wanna know how I do it, darling
I'm gonna show you how I do it, darling

Everywhere I go
I want them all to know
That we can go on and you know, you know, you know
Nobody loves me better
All around the globe
I could cruise the coast
Just to let them know and you know, you know, you know
Nobody loves me better than you

I wanna sing to you my stories
Like a gift from me to you
And let you know about all the thousand
And one times I thought of you
And you know every word is true
We always make it through and through
My love goes on and on for you

Wanna know how I'm on my own
Rocking the cities, New York to Rome
Wanna know how I do it, darling
I'm gonna show you how I do it, darling

Everywhere I go
I want them all to know
That we can go on and you know, you know, you know
Nobody loves me better
All around the globe
I could cruise the coast
Just to let them know and you know, you know, you know
Nobody loves me better than you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh all you do for love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You make me wanna go higher, run right through the fire
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh all you do for love
All that I do for love
Nobody loves me better than you

Fire, run through
Run through the fire
Run through
Fire, run through
Run through the fire
Run through
Run through
Run through the fire

Everywhere I go
I want them all to know
That we can go on and you know, you know, you know
Nobody loves me better
All around the globe
I could cruise the coast
Just to let them know and you know, you know, you know
Nobody loves me better than you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh all you do for love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You make me wanna go higher, run right through the fire
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh all you do for love
All that I do for love
Nobody loves me better than you
