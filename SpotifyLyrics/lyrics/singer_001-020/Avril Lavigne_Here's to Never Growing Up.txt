Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever but it's gettin' us drunk
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"...

Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
And we're never gonna change

Say, won't you say "forever"
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever but it's gettin' us drunk
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"...
We'll be running down the street, yelling "kiss my ass"
I'm like yeah, whatever, we're still livin' like that
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"...

Oh whoa oh
Oh whoa oh
Here's to never growing up
Oh whoa oh
Oh whoa oh
Here's to never growing up

We live like rock stars
Dance on every bar
This is who we are
I don't think we'll ever change
They say "just grow up"
But they don't know us
We don't give a fuck
And we're never gonna change

Say, won't you say "forever"
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
