Walking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here

And time, it takes time (takes time)
But I can't wait
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'd be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything, everything but mine

You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

And time, it takes time (takes time)
It's not too late
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'd be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything, everything but mine

Everything thing but mine, ooh
Mine I know, oh baby

I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I won't let you down
Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'd be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything, everything but mine

You're everything but mine, yeah
You're everything but mine, yeah, ooh
You're the sun
You're the star
You're the moon
You're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Drivin' me insane
Oh baby, baby
Oh you're everything but mine, yeah
You're everything but mine

Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love
That's made for you

Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Sunday afternoon
