I'm the rush of a bleeding heart
I'm the bruise of a rough start
I'm the dust that ignites the spark
Oh, man, I was dark
They say that I'm blue like the night sky
That I'm too weird to live, too rare to die
I tried to blow my mind a million times
But I got a light

And it's burning still
And it's burning still
Yeah, it's burning still
And it's burning
I am the light
I am the light
The light, the light, the light, the light, the light

I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out, you drown my flame
I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out
I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out, you drown my flame
I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out

I'm a prisoner on the run
I am the moon that reflects the sun
I am unbeaten and I am unwon
Oh, man, I was alone
They say that I knew that I'm never green
That I will rage against the machine
I am never something in between
But I got a light

And it's burning still
And it's burning still
Yeah, it's burning still
And it's burning
I am the light
I am the light
The light, the light, the light, the light, the light

I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out, you drown my flame
I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out
I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out, you drown my flame
I am the fire and you are the rain
Washing me out

I am the fire
I am the light, the light, the light, the light, the light, the light
