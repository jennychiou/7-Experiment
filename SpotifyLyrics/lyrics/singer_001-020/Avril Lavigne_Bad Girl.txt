Hey, hey I let you walk all over me (me)
You know that I'm a little tease (tease)
But I want it pretty please (please)

You know (you know you know) I'm crazy
I just wanna be your baby
You can fuck me, you can play me
You can love me, you can hate me

Miss me, miss me
Now you want to kiss me

Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know
