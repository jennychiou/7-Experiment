Tripped along many stones
Enough to say
I found my own way
I don't know where to go
Couldn't see where it leads

Making castles in the sand
Afraid no one else would hold my hand
I'm stained from the world
Sad, sad, sad little girl

But I see in your eyes
Your wear no disguise
Help me find my way
I'm like a bird in the sky
You helped me to fly
Fly away
Fly away
Back home... back home

Holding on to memories
Often scared
Of what I'd see
And then you came
And then you came
And rescued me
And I'm okay
I'm okay

But I see in your eyes
You wear no disguise
Help me find my way
I'm like a bird in the sky
You helped me to fly
Fly away
Fly away

Oh and I know you'll never leave me alone
I'll follow you just anywhere that you go
In my life I can see you
I know I believe you will stay, oh
In your eyes
You wear no disguise
Oh oh oh
Like a bird in the sky
You helped me to fly
Oh yeah oh oh oh

In your eyes oh oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah hey yeah oh
I said you're like a bird in the sky
You helped me to fly
Fly away
Fly away
Back home
Back home

In your eyes
