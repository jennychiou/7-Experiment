Gettin', gettin' together
Gettin', gettin' together
It's in the air, everywhere, people really starting to care
They're gettin', gettin' together

Gettin' it on with a new forever
Gettin', gettin' together
Right from the start of it
I've been a part of it
Right in the heart of it all

Gettin', gettin' together
Gettin', gettin' together
I can see you and me
Workin' it out in harmony
'Cause gettin', gettin' together
Only can help make the livin' better

Gettin', gettin' together
Life can be so much fun
Sharing with everyone
Come on and get it on now

Gettin', gettin' together
Gettin', gettin' together
Take my hand, make a stand
We gotta do it fast as we can
By gettin', gettin' together
Ridin' it out through the stormy weather

Gettin', gettin' together
There's so much love to give
There's so much life to live
I want to share it with you

Gettin', gettin' together
Getting it on with a new forever
Gettin', gettin' together
Only can help make the livin' better

Getting, getting together
Riding it out through the stormy weather
