I just wanna say
Merry Christmas to you
Yours will be white
Mine will be blue

May you have presents
'Neath the tree
And may your holidays be happy
Like mine used to be

I'm here all alone
With my blue Christmas tree
Wishing that you
Could be here with me

If I could spend this Christmas with you
Then I'd have a Merry Christmas too

(Instrumental)

If I could spend this Christmas with you
Then I'd have a Merry Christmas too
