I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothin' but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, mm

I'm lookin' for a place
I'm searchin' for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah yeah

Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeahâ€¦

It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you

Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you

Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, oh, I'm with you

I'm with you
