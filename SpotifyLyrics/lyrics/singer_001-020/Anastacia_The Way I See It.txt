Mommy used to say to me,
Bein' you's the best you can be.
And I make my mistakes,
But I don't change my ways,
Because I'm satisfied with me.
And I don't trip when my friends they say to me,
Damn you're mean.
Just because I see them same as they but differently.

Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
That's just the way I see it.
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh, come on.

Two, three, four.
Even if I really could change,
I think people would find me strange.
They think I'm buggin', maybe on somethin',
Just because it wouldn't be me.
So don't get mad 'cause we don't see the same, cause that's ok.
You be you and I'll,
I'll just concentrate on bein' me.

Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
That's just the way I see it.
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah...

I won't apologize for bein' strong,
Cause that ain't wrong.
I don't know how to be any one else but me.

Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
That's just the way I see it.
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah...

Well you're trippin' if you're thinkin',
That I ain't gonna speak my mind.
Well pardon me for livin', expressin' my opinion.
That's just the way I see it.
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah...
That's just the way I see it.
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah...
That's just the way,
That's just the way I see it.
