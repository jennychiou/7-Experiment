Once again, into the waters, into the waters unknow
It's not the end, though it's getting darker
So much darker and cold

Heartbeats fade away
Almost been erased
Nothing stays the same

'Cause I can feel your pain
And I know you're not to blame
Don't dim all the lights
When nothings going right
I'll be by your side
'Cause I can feel your pain

Levitate, from the gutter out of the gutter, of stones
Don't complicate, why suffer why would you suffer, alone

Heartbeats fade away
Almost been erased
Nothing stays the same

'Cause I can feel your pain
And I know you're not to blame
Don't dim all the lights
When nothings going right
I'll be by your side
'Cause I can feel your pain

'Cause I can feel your pain
And I know you're not to blame
Don't dim all the lights
When nothings going right
I'll be by your side
'Cause I can feel your pain
