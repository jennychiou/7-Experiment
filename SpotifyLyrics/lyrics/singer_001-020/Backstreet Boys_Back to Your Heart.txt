It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
'Cause your love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And make you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only you would tell me girl

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

Give me one more chance, to give my love to you
'Cause no one on this earth loves you like I do,
Tell me

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

I turn back time
To make you mine
And find a way back to your heart
I beg and plead
Fall to my knees
To find a way back to your heart

(Background)
These Arms of mine
Are open wide
From now until the end of time
You are my world what can I do?
This heart of mine belongs to you

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart
