I find shelter in this way
Undercover, hideaway
And can you hear when I say?
I have never felt this way

Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?

Can I be? Was I there?
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown whenever you leave
Please teach me gently how to breathe

And I'll cross oceans like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too
And I'll send images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too

Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
