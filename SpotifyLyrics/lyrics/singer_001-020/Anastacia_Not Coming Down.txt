I don't wanna go right now
Just wanna stay a while
With everything on the line
Just wanna pause homehow

Don't wanna go back again
Back to the person I used to be then
Don't wanna hold myself back no more
Don't wanna lose track again
And lose everything I could have been
Don't wanna hold myself back no more

Life is better from the top
I'll keep on climbing
Never stepping down from where I'm standing
Don't hold your breath, 'cause I'm not coming down
I'm aiming for the sky until I'm flying
Never looking down
I'll keep on trying
Don't hold your breath, 'cause I'm not coming down

Why try to complicate
Why can't we keep it straight
Whether I'm right or wrong
I'm finding where I belong

Don't wanna go back again
Back to the person I used to be then
Don't wanna hold myself back no more
Don't wanna lose track again
And lose everything I could have been
Don't wanna hold myself back no more

Life is better from the top
I'll keep on climbing
Never stepping down from where I'm standing
Don't hold your breath, 'cause I'm not coming down
I'm aiming for the sky until I'm flying
Never looking down
I'll keep on trying
Don't hold your breath, 'cause I'm not coming down

Why try to complicate
Why can't we keep it straight

Life is better from the top
I'll keep on climbing
Never stepping down from where I'm standing
Don't hold your breath, 'cause I'm not coming down
I'm aiming for the sky until I'm flying
Never looking down
I'll keep on trying
Don't hold your breath, 'cause I'm not coming down
