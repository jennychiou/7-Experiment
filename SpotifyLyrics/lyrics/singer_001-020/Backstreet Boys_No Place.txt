I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone

I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you

You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no

There ain't no place (No place, no place)
Ooh, yeah, ain't no place
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
Said there ain't no place, ain't no place like you, yeah

There ain't no place (No place, no place)
No place
There ain't no place like
No place like you
No place, no place, no place, no place
There ain't no place, no place like you
