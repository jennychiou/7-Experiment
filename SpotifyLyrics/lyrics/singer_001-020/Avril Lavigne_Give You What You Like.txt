Please wrap your drunken arms around me
And I'll let you call me yours tonight
'Cause slightly broken's just what I need
And if you give me what I want, then I'll give you what you like

Please tell me I'm your one and only
Or lie and say at least tonight
I've got a brand new cure for lonely
And if you give me what I want, then I'll give you what you like

When you turn off the lights
I get stars in my eyes
Is this love?
Maybe some day

So don't turn on the lights
I'll give you what you like

Emotions aren't that hard to borrow
When love is a word you've never learned
And in a room of empty bottles
If you don't give me what I want, then you'll get what you deserve

When you turn off the lights
I get stars in my eyes
Is this love?
Maybe some day

I've got this scene in my head
I'm not sure how it ends
Is it love?
Maybe one day

So don't turn on the lights
I'll give you what you like

I'll give you one last chance to hold me
If you give me one last cigarette
By now it's early in the morning
Now that I gave you what you want, all I want is to forget

When you turn off the lights
I get stars in my eyes
Is this love?
Maybe some day

I've got this scene in my head
I'm not sure how it ends
Is it love?
Maybe one day

So don't turn on the lights
I'll give you what you like
