"Baby, I know you're hurting. Right now you feel like you could never love again. Now all I ask is for a chance to prove that I love you."

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out
You said no, but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by, you will get to know me
A little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
And I understand
But girl, it's time to let go

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see?

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
No way, no how
I'll never make you cry
Oh I, oh I, I swear
No way, no how
Honey I swear, 'cause I know how

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
