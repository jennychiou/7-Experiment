I pass my reflection
It's someone else
I see your invention
And not myself

I turned into your perfect girl
A total stranger
Now I see, and I don't want to

Being you when it's all just an act
It's overrated!
The truth is I'm wanting me back
'Cause I can't take this
I've gotta be who I am underneath
Who I gave up, so you'd believe
Being you when it's all just an act
It's overrated!
So overrated!

I let you control me
Or so you thought
Don't think that you're perfect
Just all messed up

I hid away the best of me
Too scared to notice
Now I do, and I'm not going to

Being you when it's all just an act
It's overrated!
The truth is I'm wanting me back
'Cause I can't take this
I've gotta be who I am underneath
Who I gave up, so you'd believe
Being you when it's all just an act

It's overrated!
(Changing for a guy...)
Overrated!
(Living in a lie...)
It's overrated!
(Always asking why...)
So overrated!

The mirror is shattered...
I'm finally free!

Being you when it's all just an act
It's overrated!
The truth is I'm wanting me back
'Cause I can't take this
I've gotta be who I am underneath
Who I gave up, so you'd believe
Being you when it's all just an act

It's overrated!
Overrated!
Overrated!
So overrated!
Overrated!
