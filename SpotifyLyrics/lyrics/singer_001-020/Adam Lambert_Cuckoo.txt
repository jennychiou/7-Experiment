Feel like I'm having a meltdown
It feels like I'm losing control
They tell me I'm a danger to myself
Now the crazy train is ready to roll

Walk that walk like you don't give a fuck
You've got a right to turn it up and down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
'Cause tonight we're taking over the town

I'm gonna lose my mind like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away

Now I'm swinging off of my hinges
I'm cocked and I'm ready to go
Go on and pack up your thingses
This crazy train is ready to roll

Walk that walk like you don't give a fuck
You've got a right to turn it up and down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
'Cause tonight we're taking over the town

I'm gonna lose my mind like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away

Gotta get out of this straight jacket
Whoa cuckoo
I've gotta get out of this straight jacket
Whoa yeah

I'm gonna lose my mind like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away
