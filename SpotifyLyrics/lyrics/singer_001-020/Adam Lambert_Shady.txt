Baby, I'm on the hunt
Baby, I got my target on you
Trouble, that's what I want
And I'm gonna do
Just what I have to
Get ur ass down to the front
Go on and roll it out, I dare u
Sorry I'm kinda drunk but
Did you just say ur game
Was brand new
No, I ain't broken, but i
Need a fix
That satisfaction when i
Get my kicks
I'm up all night
I'm outta sight
Don't turn on the light
'Cause I'm feeling so shady lately
Come on and take me
Underground deep
Under the street
Come on and take me
Take me down where
Freaks like us can meet
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don't stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out
'Cause I'm feeling so shady lately
Gonna go and get me a shot
Gonna knock it back, forget all
My Blues
Yeah, that really hits the spot
I'm feeling pretty fierce in my
Dancin' shoes
No, I ain't broken, but i
Need a fix
That satisfaction when i
Get my kicks
I'm up all night
I'm outta sight
Don't turn on the light
'Cause I'm feeling so shady lately
Come on and take me
Underground deep
Under the street
Come on and take me
Take me down where
Freaks like us can meet
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don't stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out
'Cause I'm feeling so shady lately
I throw more shade than a cloudy day
The brakes don't work, I'm just a
Runaway train
Somebody come and help me out,
All I wanna be is free
I was tryin' to get down, now I can't
Get out
I'm shady lately
Come on and take me
Underground deep
Under the dtreet
Come on and take me
Take me down where
Freaks like us can meet
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don't stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out
'Cause I'm feeling so shady lately
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don't stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out
'Cause I'm feeling so shady lately
Shady lately, that's how I play
They say maybe it's just a phase
Shady late, runaway train
Blame the game, quit blaming the gays
'Cause I'm feeling so shady lately
