Yeah, yeah, oh,
Yeah, yeah,

You should be right here laying next to me
But baby you chose to love the hard way
You could be right here getting the best of me
But baby you decided he was your man

And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you calling me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down
So...

I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't want a girl
That, only wanna come back
Cause, some other man broke her heart

So Bye Bye Love
Bye Love
So Bye Bye Love (Bye Love)
Bye Love
Yeah...

Crazy how the tables turn
It wasn't long ago that you turned your back, no.
Saying there's no way that we can work (We can work)
And you were quick to move on to the next day
Yeah.

And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you calling me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down
So...

I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't want a girl
That, only wanna come back
Cause, some other man broke her heart

So Bye Bye Love (Bye Love)
Bye Love
So Bye Bye Love (Bye Bye, Bye Bye Love)
Bye Love (Bye Bye, Bye Bye Love.)
Yeah.

Can't take you back when I know (When I know)
I'm not the one you really wanted be to fall
Sorry, that I let you go (Let you go)
This time I think its best to do it at all!

Whoooo, whoo, whoooo, yeah (say goodbye to me love.)
Whoo, whooo, let it go, let it go.

Bye Bye, Bye Bye Love! (Love.)

I think I wanna stay single (I think I wanna stay.)
Maybe we're better apart (Maybe we're better apart)
See I don't want a girl
