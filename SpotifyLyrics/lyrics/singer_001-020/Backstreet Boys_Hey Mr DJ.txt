Ah, Backstreet
Yes yes y'all
One time, here we go (yes yes y'all)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yes yes y'all

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me (leading me) to you (to you)
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (yes yes y'all)
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it (make it) last (last, so long)
As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
And just imagine this alone
Let the music put you in a zone
Are you lost in, lost inside of, lost inside of me
Why do you do the dance you do
Come on and work your body, work your body

Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Keep it coming Mr. DJ... (repeat to fade)
