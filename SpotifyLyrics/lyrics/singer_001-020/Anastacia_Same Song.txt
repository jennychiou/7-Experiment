Boy these are crazy times,
It nearly blows my mind,
Living in this messed up world.
You're not the one to blame,
But if it's all the same to you,
We gotta get along.
New possibilities,
In an endless field of dreams for sure.
We're gonna get there some day.
Hey...

Throw your hands up in the air.
Livin' life without a care.
So much for us all to share,
Underneath the sun.
Dancin', movin' side to side.
Come on, you'll all enjoy the ride.
It won't be long,
'Cause we'll all be singin' the same song.

Those empty promises,
Of the things we never did,
I know, oh we wanna say.
There's something in us all,
That makes us beautiful for sure,
There's gotta be a better way.

Throw your hands up in the air.
Livin' life without a care.
So much for us all to share,
Underneath the sun.
Dancin', movin' side to side.
Come on, you'll all enjoy the ride.
It won't be long,
'Cause we'll all be singin' the same song.

Search deep and you will find,
Don't let it blow your mind.
It's better every time, oh yeah.
The struggle on the street,
The pressure and the heat.
It never bothered me, oh...
I've finished preachin' now,
So let me show you how,
It's gonna be, I said you and me,
New possibilities,
In an endless field of dreams,
I know we're gonna get there some day.

Throw your hands up in the air.
Livin' life without a care.
So much for us all to share,
Underneath the sun.
Dancin', movin' side to side.
Come on, you'll all enjoy the ride.
It won't be long,
'Cause we'll all be singin'...

Some Day ...

Throw your hands up in the air.
Livin' life without a care.
So much for us all to share,
Underneath the sun.
Dancin', movin' side to side.
Come on, you'll all enjoy the ride.
It won't be long,
'Cause we'll all be singin' the same song
