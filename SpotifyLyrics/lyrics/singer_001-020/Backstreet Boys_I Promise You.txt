It's in the silences
The words you never say
I see it in your eyes
Always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know
Is breakin' up
Hmm, does anybody ever stay in love... anymore?

I promise you
From the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you
As a lover and a friend
I will (ooh) love you like I never love again
With everything I am

Ooh
I see you look at me
When you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues
Of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide
All I know is what I feel
When I look into your eyes

I promise you (I promise you)
From the bottom of my heart
(From the bottom of my heart babay)
I will love you till death do us part

But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch, baby
