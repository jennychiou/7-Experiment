Left, right, step up to the spotlight
Why you actin' uptight
I'm takin' you to school, that's right
High, low, don't tell me you don't know
How to ever let go
I'm takin' you to school, that's right

Tonight we burn it all
Get hot, get tall yeah we're lighter than air
You got the key to your release
So pop that lock until you're lighter than air

If you wanna be that you've got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it you have got to scream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock

Banjee Boys and Dancey Girls get down, down, down
Werk bitch you don't gotta stress this got 'em feeling restless show 'em how it's done alright
Secret don't care if you don't keep it don't care if you leak it
Show 'em how it's done alright

Tonight we burn it all
Get hot, get tall yeah we're lighter than air
You got the key to your release
So pop that lock until you're lighter than air

If you wanna be that you've got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it you have got to scream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock

Banjee Boys and Dancey Girls get down, down, down
Werk, werk, werk alright
Get down
Werk, werk, werk alright

Banjee Boys and Dancey Girls get down
You better pop that lock
If you wanna be that you've got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it you have got to scream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
Get down
Baby pop that lock
Get down, get down
Pop that lock, get down
