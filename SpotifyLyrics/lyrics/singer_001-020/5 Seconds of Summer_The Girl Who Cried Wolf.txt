I'm not leaving

Every time you say to me, it's over
You just wanna start again, it's just lies
The girl who cries wolf every day
Ignored by gravity, but in the end, don't ask why

You say you wanna, but do you wanna run away?
Your great escape, oh yeah
Where you going? Always running
Find a way to call it quits again

So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leaving

('Cause I'm not leaving)

It doesn't have to be this tragedy
This endless lost parade
A castle or facade of make believe

The truth is spelled out in your eyes
Why don't you just reach out and make it clear to me?
What are you telling me?

You say you wanna, but do you wanna run away?
Your great escape, oh yeah
Where you going? Always running
Find a way to call it quits again

So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leaving

('Cause I'm not leaving)
('Cause I'm not leaving)

Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all? 'Cause I'm not dreaming
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there? Is anyone there at all?

Look at me in the eye, is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all? I'm not dreaming
Look at me in the eye, is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all? 'Cause I'm not leaving
