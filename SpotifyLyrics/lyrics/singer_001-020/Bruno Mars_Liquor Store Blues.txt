Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block

Lotto tickets, cheap beer, that's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way to the top
'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Me and my guitar tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna live on more than what I got
'Cause 68 cents just ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out until they call the cops
'Cause my job's got me goin' nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Here comes Junior Gong
I'm flying high like superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't if it's just because
Pinapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to the cops
And stand up to da bigger heads because de whole a dem a saps
All de talk dem a talk and dem (fly make no drop)
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape the trap

Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
