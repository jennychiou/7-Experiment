Something just isn't right 
I can feel it inside 
The truth isn't far behind me 
You can't deny 
When I turn the lights out 
When I close my eyes 
Reality overcomes me 
I'm living a lie 

When I'm alone 
I feel so much better 
And when I'm around you 
I don't feel together 
It doesn't feel right at all 
Together 
Together we've built a wall 
Together 
Holding hands we'll fall 
Hands we'll fall 

This has gone on so long 
I realize that I need 
Something good to rely on 
Something for me 

When I'm alone 
I feel so much better 
And when I'm around you 
I don't feel together 
It doesn't feel right at all 
Together 
Together we've built a wall 
Together 
Holding hands we'll fall 
Hands we'll fall 

My heart is broken 
I'm lying here 
My thoughts are choking 
On you, my dear 
On you, my dear 
On you, my dear 

When I'm alone 
I feel so much better 
And when I'm around you 
I don't feel together 
It doesn't feel right at all 
Together 
Together we've built a wall 
Together 
Holding hands we'll fall 
Hands we'll fall 
Together 
It doesn't feel right at all 
Together 
Together we've built a wall 
Together 
Holding hands we'll fall 
Hands we'll fall 

When I'm around you 
When I'm around you
I don't feel together, no
I don't feel together, no

When I'm around you 
When I'm around you
I don't feel together, no
I don't feel together, no
