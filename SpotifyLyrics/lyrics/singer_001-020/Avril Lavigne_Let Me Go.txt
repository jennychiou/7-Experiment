<B>Avril Lavigne</b>
Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something, but now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember the pain of December

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

<B>Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroeger</b>
I'm breaking free from these memories
Got to let it go, just let it go

I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Got to let it go, just let it go

<B>Chad Kroeger</b>
You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty
Like the hole that was left in me

Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me
Thought we were meant to be

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroeger:
I'm sorry it's too late

<B>Avril Lavigne</b>
I'm breaking free from these memories
Got to let it go, just let it go

I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Got to let it go, just let it go

I let it go
<B>Chad Kroeger</b>
(And now I know)
<B>Avril Lavigne</b>
A brand new life
<B>Chad Kroeger</b>
(Is down this road)
<B>Avril Lavigne</b>
And when it's right
<B>Chad Kroeger</b>
(You always know)
<B>Avril Lavigne</b>
So this time
<B>Chad Kroeger</b>
(I won't let go)

<B>Avril Lavigne</b>
There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late

I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go

And two goodbyes
Led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go

Oh
Oh
Oh
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Won't let you go, don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go
