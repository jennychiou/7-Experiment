I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna feel your gaze
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna be where you are
I just wanna feel your touch
I'm not asking for too much
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna wake up where you are

I used to think that love was just so easy
But I couldn't be less right, yeah
I finally found someone perfect, just for me
Gotta fly thousands of miles, yeah

I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow
Pretending it's you though
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow
Pretending it's you though

I need a minute to breathe you in
Just a second to taste your skin
I just gotta, I just gotta
Feel you here right next to me
Can we please just go back in time?
Those lazy Sundays, you and I
'Cause every hour and every day
Gets more painful when you're away

I used to think that love was just so easy
But I couldn't be less right, yeah

I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow
Pretending it's you though
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow
Pretending it's you though

And I can't lie, babe, I'm losing my patience
Too much waiting for you
Every time that I wake up
My hands go where I'm waiting for you
I know I say that I'm fine
But I'm losing my mind
Just need to hold you
Don't take your time
Oh, baby, I

I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow
Pretending it's you though
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow
Pretending it's you though
