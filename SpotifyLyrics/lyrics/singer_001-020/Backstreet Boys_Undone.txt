Your words burn, they're melting
What we have, I'm breaking down
No reason, no warning, no love loss
You might as well

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love without you
I used to think I'd die without you
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without you
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

This constant echoing
In my head,
I'm spinning round
You seem so unaffected
While I go on in this hell

Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love without you
I used to think I'd die without you
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

I can't feel without you
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you
And it's killing me
That we can be undone

We can be undone

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
It's dragging me to my grave

You're talking now
And I'm hearin' everything that you say
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love without you
I used to think I'd die without you
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone
I can't feel without you, You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undone

I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love with you
I used to think I'd die without you
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone
I can't feel without you, You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me
That we could be undone
