When I'm with him my body's weaker
Fall deeper, one word and I'm already shakin'
He's like a message in a bottle, sent from him just for me
It's like one thousand butterflies inside me, like
I'm floating in a dream that never ends
The sweetest thing, I can't get enough, it's never enough

I know that without him, I wouldn't feel like this
Nothing ever makes me feel like this
Wouldn't be the same if he went away and I keep on countin'
Every breath I take
Every little breath I wouldn't be the same if he went away
If he went away

You've never gotta worry girl I'll never leave you S O L O
Even if I'm far way I'll use my last breath so you'll know
Girl you're all in my head yeah and no other compares, yeah
And I've never felt this free
It's like one thousand butterflies inside me, like
I'm floating in a dream that never ends
The sweetest thing, I can't get enough, it's never enough

I know that without him, I wouldn't feel like this
Nothing ever makes me feel like this
Wouldn't be the same if he went away and I keep on countin'
Every breath I take
Every little breath I wouldn't be the same if he went away
If he went away

Don't know why I'm not afraid, no I'm not ashamed
That I feel this way, it gives me something to fight for
Now I know I'm not letting go, no I'm not in the cold anymore
And I feel safe with him in my arms, never lonely, my only
All I was looking for

I know that without him, I wouldn't feel like this
Nothing ever makes me feel like this
Wouldn't be the same if he went away and I keep on countin'
Every breath I take
Every little breath I wouldn't be the same if he went away
If he went away
