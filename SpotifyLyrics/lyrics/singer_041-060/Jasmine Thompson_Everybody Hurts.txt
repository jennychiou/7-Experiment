When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone
If you feel like letting go
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts sometimes
Sometimes
