Where you go, I'll follow, is that so naive of me?
It could be the wrong way, if it's not what it seems to be
But when I look in your direction
I erase all questions, fears and doubts fall away
I have no regrets today

Isn't that how it should be, if it's not then show me
Does it go further than a heart break or last longer than a mistake
Do we get to the part where you give me your heart
And you can't take it back if you try

Can you tell me
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me just how far
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me just how long
Can anybody tell me, tell me just how far
Can you tell me how far for love
Does it have a limit
Or will it be gone, does it let go or forever hold on
Can anybody tell me, tell me just how far
Tell me how far for love
How far will it run to catch me
And how long will love wait until I'm ready
If I'm wrong, will love forget me
Does anybody know just how far it goes

You say it's so good with me by your side
Can you say the same on a bad day
If I wanna stop the world than get off this ride
If you let me down I would be lost only to be found
I might take you on a long chase
But you gotta know that I will never stay away

Tell me
Tell me when is it enough to say we just don't want to
Can we go further than a heart break, last longer than a mistake
And I wanna know is there really a road
Where we can turn around if we try

Can you tell me
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me just how far
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me just how long
Can anybody tell me, tell me just how far
Can you tell me how far for love
Does it have a limit
Or will it be gone, does it let go or forever hold on
Can anybody tell me, tell me just how far
Tell me how far for love
How far will it run to catch me
And how long will love wait until I'm ready
If I'm wrong, will love forget me
Does anybody know just how far it goes

Can anybody tell me
Is it foolish or fearless of me, true unconditionally, tell me

Can you tell me
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me just how far
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me just how long
Can anybody tell me, tell me just how far
Can you tell me how far for love
Does it have a limit
Or will it be gone, does it let go or forever hold on
Can anybody tell me, tell me just how far
Tell me how far for love
How far will it run to catch me
And how long will love wait until I'm ready
If I'm wrong, will love forget me
Does anybody know just how far it goes
