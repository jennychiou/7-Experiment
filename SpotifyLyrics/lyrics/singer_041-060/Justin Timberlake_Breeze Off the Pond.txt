Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

Grass is greenest when you're here with me, okay, mmm
If what they got is all good then why would they trade
Now we are in the zone and we ain't gonna let it go, no way
(No we ain't gonna let it go, gonna let it go)
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away

Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, when they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

Now the sun dances across the sparkly waves, yeah
While we're canoeing, stoned as "Tiny Dancer" plays
Huff and puff all they want, but this house isn't made of straw
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away

Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

You and I against the world
(Against the world, against the world)
You and I against the world and everything it comes with
No denying what you're worth
(What you're worth, what you're worth)
I'd be foolish beyond words to lose you

What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway

What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway, uh

Like breeze off the pond (breeze off the pond)
Or trees on the lawn (or trees on the lawn)

Don't let it move you

You and I against the world
