I know it's been a little tough lately
You've been looking kind of worried lately
Like you don't know what's going on with us
You get lost and then I get sadder, we forget about the things that matter
We should have a little faith in us for once
It can't always be perfect, gets better then gets worse then
Just proves that we're still learning, baby I know

It gets so hard
Sometimes we aren't quite like we used to be you and me
But we've got no scars and it's been so long my love is strong
Strong as it used to be, you and me, we still belong
(We used to be, you and me baby)
(We used to be, you and me baby)

There's nothing more important to me
Than to make us all we could be
I'll be sure to always take the time, oh
Know my world revolves around you
I'm who I am because I've found you
I'd never take for granted that you're mine
No no no
I love you so completely, come kiss me softly
I need you like you need me, baby I know

It gets so hard
Sometimes we aren't quite like we used to be you and me
But we've got no scars and it's been so long my love is strong
Strong as it used to be, you and me, we still belong
(We used to be, you and me baby)
(We used to be, you and me baby)

We'll make it through together
I'm getting it all getting I'm it all to you
Baby I swear I'll never, never gonna let you slip away
We'll make it through together
I'm getting it all I'm getting it all to you
It's you and me forever, baby I know that it gets

It gets so hard
Sometimes we aren't quite like we used to be you and me
But we've got no scars and it's been so long my love is strong
Strong as it used to be, you and me, we still belong
(We used to be, you and me baby)
(We used to be, you and me baby)

We belong, oh
We belong, oh
