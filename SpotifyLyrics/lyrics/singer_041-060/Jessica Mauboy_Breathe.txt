How can I, how can I breathe?
How can I, how can I breathe? yeah

I'm breakin' down a little,
I'm throwin' in the towel,
Need you to get me off the ground

You're sayin' that it's over,
And we can't be together,
But I really need you around

Just stay a minute
And don't you let go of me,
You take my breathe away,
Oh, I don't wanna be left on my own like this
I'm breathless

Now I can't even breathe,
I gave you all of me, but you won't let me breathe
You're killing me softly, breathe
Without you there's no need
So how can I breathe?
You're all the air I need, so let me breathe

How can I, how can I breathe?
How can I, how can I breathe? Yeah

Was I supposed to know, you're leaving me alone?
And knew that it would end this way
I'm lost without your lovin'
I'm missing everythin'
Now you're so far away

Don't waste a minute
Just make your way home to me
Don't take my breath away
Why'd you wanna leave me on my own like this?
I'm breathless

I can't even breathe
I gave you all of me
But you won't let me breathe
You're killin' me softly
Breathe, yeah, oh
Without you there's no need
So how can I breathe, yeah
Oh, you're all the air I need
So let me breathe

How can I, how can I breathe? Yeah
How can I, how can I breathe? Yeah

I don't wanna be here no more
Ever since you walked out the door
You took away my heart
You're tearing me apart
Thought you were all I need
You're all that I'm waiting for
So I waited for tomorrow, until you come back to me

So you can let me breathe, eh
I gave you all of me, let me breathe
You're killing me softly, breathe

Without you there's no need
So how can I breathe?
You're all the air I need, so let me breathe

Let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Let me breathe

Let me breathe
