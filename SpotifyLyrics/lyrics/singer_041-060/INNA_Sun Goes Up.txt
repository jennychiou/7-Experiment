Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

Four'o'clock in the morning
Time to party
Time to let it out
Wanna dance to the sunlight
And I know you'll join me tonight

I wanna feel it
I wanna feel it tonight

I wanna feel it
I wanna feel it so tight

Tell me where's the party
Tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it going 'til 4 am
And we are gonna do it
Gonna do it all again

Oh, when the sun goes up
Move, let it go so tell me
What you like
And come and give it to me
'Cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

I wake up feeling hazy
It's so crazy
Do it all again

Went and danced
And it's over
And I need you
Join me tonight

I wanna feel it
I wanna feel it tonight

I wanna feel it
I wanna feel it so tight

Tell me where's the party
Tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it going 'til 4 am
And we are gonna do it
Gonna do it all again

Oh, when the sun goes up
Move, let it go so tell me
What you like
And come and give it to me
'Cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

Tell me where's the party
Tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it going 'til 4 am
And we are gonna do it
Gonna do it all again

Oh, when the sun goes up
Move, let it go so tell me
What you like
And come and give it to me
'Cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light
