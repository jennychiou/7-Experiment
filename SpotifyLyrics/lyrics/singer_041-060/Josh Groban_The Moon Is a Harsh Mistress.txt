See her as she flies
Golden saills across the skies
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold
The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold

Once the sun did shine
And Lord it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pine
And then the darkness fell
And the moon's a harsh mistress
It's hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
And I fell out of her heart
I fell down on my face
Yes I did
And I tripped and I missed my star
Then I fell and fell ago
And the moon's a harsh mistress
And the sky's made of stone

The moon's a harsh mistress
She's hard to call your own
