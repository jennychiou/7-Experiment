I just want to enjoy my life
And show this world how to care
But nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing my girl will be there

Are you happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowin' that you really broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowin' that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Sayin' you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you, for...

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
(You're on your own)
I'ma do for me what's right

In your eyes I see a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now I'll wash my hands
'Cause I love you baby, love you baby
Pharrell say don't do it the same
But this man ain't playin' my games
But for you my soul still remains
'Cause I love you baby, love you baby

Are you happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowin' that you really broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowin' that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Sayin' you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you, for...

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
(You're on your own)
I'ma do for me what's right

I hope your thinking
(Remember girl when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, you don't understand)
We're gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel) about you

I got something I wanna tell you girl

I hope your thinking
(Remeber girl when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, you don't understand)
We're gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel) about you

Let me tell you one more time

I hope you're thinking
(Remember girl when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, you don't understand)
We're gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel) about you

Oh baby, yeah yeah yeah yeah
See I ain't gonna be the one
Ain't gonna play these games with you
But I still love you
Remember girl when I was your man
And nothing gonna take that away
No no no no, no no no

See I remember, in December
We were walking holding hands
And I was your man

Can't we just get back to that?...Baby
