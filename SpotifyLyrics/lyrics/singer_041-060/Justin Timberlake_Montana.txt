Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, huh

Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back

Everything is heightened
We're feelin' vulnerable
I'm makin' you this vow, uh
That you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna

Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, huh

And now my circle of friends got tighter
I don't have time no more
Look, I'm only fuckin' with you, for real
And baby, you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me, "Go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna"

Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, huh

Now I know it's late o'clock
And we've been kissin' for hours
When the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows cast up on the mountains
It gives the stars somethin' to watch

Yes, I know it's late o'clock, oh
And we've been kissin' for hours
But when the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows cast up on the mountains
It gives the stars somethin' to watch

Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, huh

Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back

Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
