It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you

Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, then Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes, sometimes

It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
