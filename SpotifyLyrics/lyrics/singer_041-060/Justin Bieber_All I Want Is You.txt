Sitting here all alone
Watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days
We threw them snowballs
I can't believe
I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you
And nobody else

And I'm sorry
If I pushed you away
'Cause I need to here
And I want for you to know

And I don't care
If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now

And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that
All I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you
This Christmas

And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here
Here through the holidays yeah
I just wanna if you feel the same way
Because I'm lonely baby
Want you to hold me baby

And I'm sorry
If I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you
And I want you to stay

And I don't care
If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that
All I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you
This Christmas

Wrapping gifts without you babe
Starting in December and there's no call
I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay

And I don't care
If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now

And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that
All I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you
This Christmas
