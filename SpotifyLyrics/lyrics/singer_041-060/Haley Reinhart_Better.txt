Now I'm right where I wanna be
Out on the road, back to 818
Back to the place where I can breathe
Where it just feels better
You think you treated me like a queen
But I don't feel like no royalty
Well, things are finally clear to see
You want forever, I'm thinking never, never

I threw your ring into the ocean
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better now
I watch it sink, and now I'm floating
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better now

Better, well better.

Just because you're lookin' fine
Baby, that won't keep me satisfied
You wear that smile like a disguise
But I just need something better
Jump down off your pedestal
Not even you could have it all

Don't drive by, please don't call
When I say never, I mean forever

I threw your ring into the ocean
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better now

I watch it sink, and now I'm floating
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better now

So long, I felt so weighed down
Anchors away now, I'm finally letting go
I threw your ring into the ocean

Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better now
Better, better, better
Better, better, better

I threw your ring into the ocean
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better
I threw your ring into the ocean
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better now
I watched it sink and now I'm floating
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better now
I threw your ring into the ocean

Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better, feeling better
I threw your ring into the ocean
Now I'm feeling better
Feeling better, feeling better
I said better, better, better, better...
