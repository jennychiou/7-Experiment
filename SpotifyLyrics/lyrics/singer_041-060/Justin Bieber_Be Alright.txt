Across the ocean, across the sea,
Starting to forget the way you looked at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I,
Oh I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too,
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be all right, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be all right
