You and me are one in the same
It's the one thing that they can't change
You and me live for the ride
I'll take the drop if you're on my side
I'm hearing them sayin' we're wrong for each other
I'm taking my chances for worse or for better
Why can't they see some things are meant to be?

Black out the satellite, where should we run to?
It's gettin' physical boy
And if you want to go somewhere no one can find us
We can get out of here

Black out the satellite and be my road star
You wanted anything else so show ya my heart
Let's leave this city behind us
We can get out of here

(Let's go)

Underground and get lost with you
Only way from my point of view
Leave the rest of them in the dark
No one has to know where we are
I'm over the stories that we'll never make it
When I think of losing you baby I hate it
Why can't they see it's between you and me?

Black out the satellite, where should we run to?
It's gettin' physical boy
And if you want to go somewhere no one can find us
We can get out of here

Black out the satellite and be my road star
You wanted anything else so show ya my heart
Let's leave this city behind us
We can get out of here

Don't know where we'll be tomorrow
But I know how I feel right now
They don't have to understand
But baby if you take my hand...
(Let's go)

Black out the satellite, where should we run to?
It's gettin' physical boy
And if you want to go somewhere no one can find us
We can get out of here

Black out the satellite and be my road star
You wanted anything else so show ya my heart
Let's leave this city behind us
We can get out of here
