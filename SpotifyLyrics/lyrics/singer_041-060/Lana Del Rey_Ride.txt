I've been out on that open road,
You can be my full time daddy,
White and gold.

Singing blues has been gettin' old,
You can be my full time baby,
Hot or cold.

Don't break me down,
(Don't break me down),
I been travelling too long,
(I been travelling too long),
I've been tryin' too hard,
(I've been tryin' too hard),
With one pretty song,
(With one pretty song, oh).

I hear the birds on the summer breeze,
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight.
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble,
But I, I've got a war in my mind.

So, I just ride, just ride,
I just ride, I just ride.

Dyin' young and playing hard,
That's they way my father made his,
Life and art.

Drink all day and we talk till dark,
That's the way the road dogs do it,
Light till dark.

Don't leave me now,
(Don't leave me now),
Don't say goodbye,
(Don't say goodbye),
Don't turn around,
(Don't turn around),
Leave me high and dry.

I hear the birds on the summer breeze,
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight.
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble,
But I, I've got a war in my mind.

I just ride, just ride,
I just ride, I just ride.

I'm tired of feeling,
Like I'm fuckin' crazy!
I'm tired of drivin',
Till I see stars in my eyes!
All I've got to keep
Myself sane, baby,
So I just drive, I just ride!

Hear the birds on the summer breeze,
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight.
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble,
But I, I've got a war in my mind.

I just ride, just ride,
I just ride, I just ride.
