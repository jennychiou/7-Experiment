Something 'bout you girl
Something makes you so good
Something 'bout you girl
Something messing me, messing me up
You hit me like "Here's a fever for you,
You can't sweat out and you just can't cool"

I think you know you got style
Alright alright alright
I think you know you're so fine (ooh)
You're one of a kind
Beautiful all the time
Girl you're one of a kind, yeah

When you walk in
All people stop and stare
When you walk in
They whisper, "Look at her"
How do you do the things you do?
How do you do so that
When you walk in the room

All the guys go (whistle)
Even the girls go (whistle)

Feels like the whole world's
All crazy 'bout you girl
All crazy 'bout you girl
I'm so crazy 'bout you girl
That it's like your beauty makes me hush

Nothing compares to your eyes
Nothing you do girl
Nothing's making me anything but wild
You spin me round, I'm a sucker for you
I'm feeling down 'cause I know it's true

I think you know you got style
Alright alright alright
I think you know you're so fine (ooh)
You're one of a kind
Beautiful all the time
Girl, you're one of a kind, yeah
