Once again
All around the world
Dynamic duos are back
JB, Luda
I love everything about you
You’re imperfectly perfect
Everyone’s itching for beauty
But just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found
Can the DJ please reverse it
In life we pay for change
Let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles
But love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun
While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

All around the world
People want to be loved, yeah

They’re no different than us
All around the world
