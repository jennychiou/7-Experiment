Wake up world
Now do you hear it?
It's time to go and spread the word
Everywhere, oh yeah
People dancing
No matter where you turn

In the street gonna stop the traffic
Downtown, do you feel the magic
To the left, to the right
Just look to the sky, even angry birds are happy

Sing along, don't try to fight it
Cause you know tonight it's going down
Everybody move to the party alarm

Boys and girls, there's a party alarm
Going whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Across the world, there's a party alarm
Going whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa

Boys go "Yo"
Say "Let's go"
Hands in the air
Let's get it all rolling
Whoa whoa whoa
Everybody move to the party alarm

My stereo, padapada boom
Beat the music (beat the music)
Into shoulders, knees and toes
Bring your friends
And some L.U.V
It's proper party code

In the street gonna stop the traffic
Downtown, do you feel the magic
To the left, to the right
Just look to the sky even angry birds are happy

Sing along, don't try to fight it
Cause you know tonight it's going down
Everybody move to the party alarm

Boys and girls, there's a party alarm
Going whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Across the world, there's a party alarm
Going whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa

Girls go "Whoa, let's get down"
Come on, come on
And turn it up loud now
Whoa whoa whoa
Everybody move to the party alarm

You've got to move it, turn around now
People gotta move to the party alarm
You've got to groove it, turn around now
Turn around now, turn around now, yeah

Boys and girls, there's a party alarm
Going whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Across the world, there's a party alarm
Going whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa

Everybody move to the party alarm
