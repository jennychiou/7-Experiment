I I thought I really had it all
I I never really had to fall in love again
For a life full of happiness (yeah)
Taught my heart to never have a say
Since the day I built a barricade and closed it in
Nobody was getting in

Call me a fool cause I was running a mile
Call me a fool cause I was so in denial
Somehow you found a way to make me wanna change
I don't wanna turn back now

Cause this is the moment the barrier's broken
I'm finally gonna let it out
Now my mind stopped thinking my heart's now taken
The barriers are breaking down
The future was frozen reality poisoned
Till the day you came around
Got my world to start spinning out
The barriers are breaking down

This this world can be a funny place
Just like that I'm in a different space holding on
This time I ain't letting go
I hear the way my feelings fall so long
So deep you you brought them back to the surface
And then you showed me why it was worth it

Call me a fool cause I was running a mile
Call me a fool cause I was so in denial
Somehow you found a way to make me wanna change
I don't wanna turn back now

Cause this is the moment the barrier's broken
I'm finally gonna let it out
Now my mind stopped thinking my heart's now taken
The barriers are breaking down
The future was frozen reality poisoned
Till the day you came around
Got my world to start spinning now
The barriers are breaking down

Think once think twice
And you're thinking way too much
I gotta let my heart outside

Cause this is the moment the barrier's broken
Oh it's broken
Oh it's broken

Cause this is the moment the barrier's broken
I'm finally gonna let it out
Now my mind stopped thinking my heart's now taken
The barriers are breaking down
The future was frozen reality poisoned
Till the day you came around
Got my world to start spinning now
The barriers are breaking down
