There are times
I close my eyes
And wish upon a star
I tell myself my fairytale's not far
Not far

I close my eyes
And look deep inside
Let the dreams that I have take flight
I lift up my head
And just believe
Knowing I was made to dream

From now on
My life's my song
And I write the words
My moment will come
And until then, I'll hold on
I'll hold on

I close my eyes
And look deep inside
Let the dreams that I have take flight.
I lift up my head
And just believe,
Knowing I was made to dream

Made to dream
To live my goals
To be counted for
To stand
Knowing you'll take my hand

I'm here
I was made for this
To sing
Till I have no voice at all
Till the dream makes me whole

I close my eyes
And know deep inside
Let the dreams that I have take flight.
I lift up my head
And just believe

Knowing I was made to dream
Knowing I was made to dream
Made to dream
