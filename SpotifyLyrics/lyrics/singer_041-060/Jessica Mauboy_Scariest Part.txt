I'm walking down the road
I start to see the ghost
Of everything we had, the bad, the new, the past is over
Like a dying wilted rose on the ground so cold it froze
I try to pick it up but it just crumbles in my hand like ashes

This is where you wanna close your eyes
Here a voice saying hold on tight
You look around for someone by your side
This is where you wanna run and leave
The moment that makes you wanna scream
Living in a nightmare tonight

This is why I'm afraid of the dark
It's the scariest part of a broken heart
Hurts so bad, hits you hard
It's the scariest part of a broken heart

I'm locking down my doors, there's no more us no more
And I can't let the pain get in the way of me of moving on
Like a never ending dream where everything ain't what it seems
But still I wake up all alone drowning 'cause I'm barely breathing

This is where you wanna close your eyes
Here a voice saying hold on tight
Living in a nightmare tonight

This is why I'm afraid of the dark
It's the scariest part of a broken heart
Hurts so bad, hits you hard
It's the scariest part of a broken heart

Oh

This is why I'm afraid of the dark
It's the scariest part of a broken heart
Hurts so bad, hits you hard
It's the scariest part of a broken heart
