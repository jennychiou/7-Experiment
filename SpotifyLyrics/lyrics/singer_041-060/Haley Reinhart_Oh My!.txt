Oh, oh, my, oh my
Hot, hot heat between you and me
I'm burning up inside
You shock me with your ways
Ain't polite for me to say
Like a firecracker blowing up the sky

You don't know, you don't see
All the static electricity
And every time you touch me right it's like
Oh, oh, oh, oh my
Oh my, oh my

Sticky skin in the summer night
All this tension is mad
You rock me with your touch
And I'm likin' it so much
'Cause you're the best thing I ever had

You don't know, you don't see
The way your lovin' is shocking me
And every time you touch me right it's like
Oh, oh, oh, oh my, oh my

Look, well, these are the facts
She likes the phrases I make up from scratch
She likes my raps
She likes my racks how they hold up my slacks
She saw me when I snuck in the back, relax
Slapped a couple daps
Took a couple photos, took a few snaps, like that
Soon as she turned her back I was gone in a flash
In the blink of an eye
Got a speeding ticket for living my life too fast
I said sorry, pretty lady, it's a race against the clock and I don't like contracts
So let's make it a night to remember
Before last call, another round, two glasses
Shaken not stirred, this is my word
All I need is a night, you gon' call me fantastic, stop

You don't know, you don't see
All the static electricity
And every time you touch me right it's like
Every time you touch me right it's like
Every time you touch me right it's like
Oh, oh, oh, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
