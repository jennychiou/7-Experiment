Gotten too far off the map
Not so sure I can get back.
Was I the one who drifted off?
Did I take advantage of good love?
'Cause I swear I did everything I could've done
But what good is love
Without the trust?

Does anybody wanna
Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd read all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked

'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

Something steady, something good
It's probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid is getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close
But I don't know, it's hard to read
So I'll just keep moving
Hoping someone out there's gonna

Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd read all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked

'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

S.O.S is out of hand
Just holding out for a love again
I'm sending signals, find me fast
I know, I know
There's gotta be somebody who can

Put me back, put me back
On the map
'Cause I'd read all about it
I'd do anything anything
That you asked

'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map
