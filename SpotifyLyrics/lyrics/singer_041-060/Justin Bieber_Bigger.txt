The love, the love is
Bigger
The love, the love is
Bigger
The love, the love is
Bigger
Big

Gotta believe in me (gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale (yeah)
The tooth under your pillow case
No I won't I won't
Ever have let you down? (no)
like a see saw let's you down (oh)
You know why
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby

We're big enough
To stand in the picture
We're big enough
To stand next to love

I was a player
When I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker
When I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger
Love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoaa

Remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed close
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the schoolyard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby

We're big enough
To stand in the picture
We're big enough
To stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoaa

Remember those stroll down street?
(I remember that)
Don't knock you earrings, like yesterday
They shine on me
We were little then
In class daydreamed about you ooooohhohh
Just remember you ooooohhohh

Since then all I can remember is the love
Falling down

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger (love bigger)
I'm bigger (I'm bigger)
and you're bigger (you're bigger)
Whoaa

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger
I'm bigger
(...)
and you're bigger
Whoaa
