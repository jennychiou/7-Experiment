I've tried this love thing before
And lost it somewhere
This time I'm not letting go for nothing
Cause somehow boy in my
Head I knew you'd be here
It would just only take some
Time for us to get it right
It's a risk but you make it worth taking
So I let you hold my heart if
You're going my way

Boy we can take the long way home
It just makes sense when I'm with you
Why does it have to be over
When you can just pull me closer
Don't say goodbye, just kiss me hello
Just kiss me hello
Just kiss me hello
You tell the same stupid
Jokes over, and over
It's funny they never get old
They keep me laughing boy
In my head you're always here
It's like you're always on my mind
I never want to say goodbye
It's a risk but you make it worth taking
So I let you hold my heart if
You're going my way

Boy we can take the long way home
It just makes sense when I'm with you
Why does it have to be over
When you can just pull me closer
Don't say goodbye, just kiss me hello
Just kiss me hello
Just kiss me hello
It's a risk but you make it worth taking
So I let you hold my heart if
You're going my way

Boy we can take the long way home
It just makes sense when I'm with you
Why does it have to be over
When you can just pull me closer
Don't say goodbye, just kiss me hello
Just kiss me hello
Just kiss me hello
