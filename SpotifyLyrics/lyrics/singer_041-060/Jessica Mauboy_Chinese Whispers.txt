Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoo

Looking back to the third grade
Nothing has changed, sitting in the room
In a small circle of bloom
Waiting for the secret to come

I hear the words but the same to a different tune
Everybody's trying to bring in their point of view
No one knows just what we've begun

I know
(I know)
You know
(You know)
It's so predictable
The way it goes, it's driving me crazy

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers

Stuck in a world of worship and magazines
Messing with the minds of inspiring teens
I don't know, don't know where to turn

I need some inspiration
With information to take home
'Cause all this trivial information is becoming old
'Cause now's the time, I'm breaking the mode

I know
(I know)
You know
(You know)
It's so predictable
The way it goes, it's driving me crazy

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers

I know
(I know)
You know
(You know)
It's so predictable
The way it goes, it's driving me crazy

I know
(I know)
You know
(You know)
It's so predictable
The way it goes, it's driving me crazy

He says, she says
We say, they say
He say

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers

He says, she says
We say, they say
He say
Like Chinese whispers

He says, she says
(Yeah)
We say, they say
(Ooh)
This game of Chinese whispers
