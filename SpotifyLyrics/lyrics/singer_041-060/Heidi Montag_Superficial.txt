It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
But it ain't so hard

It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
But it ain't so hard

Hoppin out that Maserati
All I see is paparazzi
For the front cover of a magazine
I pose in everything I wear
Lots of makeup, people stare
Always center of attention
Lookin' so bootylicious

And I don't care
That I keep pissin' people off
Ima let 'em talk
I don't give a damn what they say
It isn't fair
That I wear diamonds for breakfast
And I know this isn't helping

They say I'm superficial
Some call me a bitch
They just mad 'cause I'm sexy, famous, and I'm rich
I brought the latest fashions and I set the latest trends
They all say I'm conceited 'cause they really wanna be me
So they say I'm superficial
'Cause I got money
They say I'm superficial
But they really don't know me
They say I'm superficial
'Cause I got money
They say I'm superficial
But they really don't know me

I'm addicted to the glitz and glamour
Maybe I need Betty Ford
A rehab for my shopping habit
If I see it, I gotta have it
Cause Daddy never says no
Mama get what she wants
I keep it new, new
Like I'm supposed to

And I don't care
That I keep pissin' people off
Ima let 'em talk
I don't give a damn what they say
It isn't fair
That I wear diamonds for breakfast
And I know this isn't helping

They say I'm superficial
Some call me a bitch
They just mad 'cause I'm sexy, famous, and I'm rich
I brought the latest fashions and I set the latest trends

They all say I'm conceited 'cause they really wanna be me
So they say I'm superficial
'Cause I got money
They say I'm superficial
But they really don't know me
They say I'm superficial
'Cause I got money
They say I'm superficial
But they really don't know me

It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
But it ain't so hard

It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
It ain't that easy
But it ain't so hard


They say I'm superficial
Some call me a bitch
They just mad 'cause I'm sexy, famous, and I'm rich
I brought the latest fashions and I set the latest trends
They all say I'm conceited 'cause they really wanna be me
So they say I'm superficial
'Cause I got money
They say I'm superficial
But they really don't know me
They say I'm superficial
'Cause I got money
They say I'm superficial
But they really don't know me
