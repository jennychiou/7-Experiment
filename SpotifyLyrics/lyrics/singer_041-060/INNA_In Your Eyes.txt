I want your body
Won't live without it
So turn up the party
I'm feeling naughty (Suelta!)
Stay close to me,
I'll be all that you need
Don't deny what you want baby
I want your body
All I desire,
You relight the fire,
Just come with me,
Come with me.
Just gonna let it go tonight,
All I want is you,
Thousand shades of blue
Dancing in your eyes.
I want your body.
Dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding
Dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding

Dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding
Dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding

It's getting hotter,
The beat is louder.
I know you want me
And I want your body.

Stay close to me,
I'll be all that you need,
Don't deny what you want, baby.
I want your body.
All I desire,
You relight the fire,
Just come with me,
Come with me.

Just gonna let it go tonight,
All I want is you,
Thousand shades of blue
Dancing in your eyes.
I'm just gonna let it go tonight,

Hold you close to me,
Dancing in your eyes.
