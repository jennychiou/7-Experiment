Let me tell you 'bout a girl that I used to be
Same name, same face but a different me
She didn't know what she was thinking
Didn't know her world was sinking
Had her dreams written on a paper in her hand
Held on tight but she didn't understand
The loving heart that she's replacing
Or the past that she's erasing

We all get lost sometimes 
And we forget who we are
And we forget who we are
Somewhere along the way

We're all running in a crazy race
Never thinking 'bout the hearts we break
And as our home starts fading away
Things are never gonna be the same
'Cause when you're standing there all alone
Losing everything you've ever known
You're staring at a different face
Things are never gonna be the same

I wish that I could share a different point of view
But the words coming out wouldn't speak the truth
You wouldn't know what I was really thinking
And I'd return to the girl who's sinking
Sinking down to the world that awaits below
And I don't wannna be there anymore
Don't wanna be there anymore, no

And we all get lost sometimes
And we forget who we are
And we forget who we are
Somewhere along the way

We're all running in a crazy race
Never thinking 'bout the hearts we break
And as our home starts fading away
Things are never gonna be the same
'Cause when you're standing there all alone
Losing everything you've ever known
You're staring at a different face
Things are never gonna be the same

The more you win, the more you want
It never ends, it never stops
Oh, it's never enough
The more you win, the more you want
It never ends, it never stops
Oh, it's never enough

We're all running in a crazy race
Never thinking 'bout the hearts we break
And as our home starts fading away
Things are never gonna be the same
'Cause when you're standing there all alone
Losing everything you've ever known
You're staring at a different face
Things are never gonna be the same
Things are never gonna be the same
Things are never gonna be the same

When you're standing there all alone
Losing everything you've ever known
You're staring at a different face
Things are never gonna be the same
Things are never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
