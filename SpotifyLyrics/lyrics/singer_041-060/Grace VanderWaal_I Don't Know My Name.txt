I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying
Just trying

So I heard you are my sister's friend
You get along quite nicely
You ask me why I cut my hair
And changed myself completely

I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying
Just trying

I went from bland and popular
To joining the marching band
I made the closest friends
I'll ever have in my lifetime

I am lost trying to get found
In an ocean of people
Please don't ask me any questions
There'll be a valid answer
I'll just say

That I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying
Just trying

I now know my name!
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say, I'm not trying
But I'm trying
To find my way
