It sounded so much better in my mind, mind
I guess I messed it up again this time, time, time
There's something else that I wanted to say, say
But my twisted tongue got in the way, way, way

Ooh
My mouth is moving without thinking
Ooh
My brain and mouth on different systems
Why can't you see my side of things
I've been thinking 'bout it ever since

I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda froze in my tracks
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda had a panic attack

I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good

Rerun the conversation in my head, head
Think of all the things that I should have said instead

Ooh
My mouth is moving without thinking
Ooh
My brain and mouth on different systems
Why can't you see my side of things
I've been thinking 'bout it ever since

I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda froze in my tracks
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda had a panic attack

I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good

I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good

My words, my mind
Are worth all your time
My words, my mind
Are worth all your time

I don't wanna be a puppet game and caught on your line

I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda had a panic attack
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda froze in my tracks

I wish it went the way it went in my head
But it kinda crushed and burned instead
Why does it always end up like it is now
So many wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good
