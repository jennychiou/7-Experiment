I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
The definition of insanity is looping on repeat
And expecting things to change
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
She always comes to me highly disguised
An angel whispering, so many pretty shapes

It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance
It's a dance
It's a dance

Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered, twisted and conflicted
So I casually can shoot the shit
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping-pong

It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance
It's a dance
It's a dance

But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out

It's a dance
It's a dance
It's a dance
