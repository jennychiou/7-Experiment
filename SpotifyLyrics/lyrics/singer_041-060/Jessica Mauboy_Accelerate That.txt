Speed up speed up, speed up speed up
I don't wanna waste my time, I don't wanna waste my time
Speed up speed up, speed up speed up

I like to think that I'm a pretty fly piece
Ladies I know you feel just like me
So don't expect me to wait for a drink
Better think fast if you're trying to get some
Ask me no more questions use your own discretion
There's no more time for second guessin'

Oh you're moving way too slow
You need to step on the gas
Accelerate that, way too laid back
Accelerate that, slow motion ain't gonna get you nowhere
Speed up, speed up
It ain't gonna get you nowhere
Speed up, speed up, accelerate that

Why can't you see that it's extreme necessity
For you to compliment my fabulosity
I don't wait for the party, I create the scene
That's why I'm asking myself "what the?" the, the
Hello to you goodbye, wastin' all my time
And acting way too shy, I would just turn you out

Oh you're moving way too slow
You need to step on the gas
Accelerate that, way too laid back
Accelerate that, slow motion ain't gonna get you nowhere
Speed up, speed up
It ain't gonna get you nowhere
Speed up, speed up, accelerate that

Speed up, speed up, speed it up
Speed up, speed up, speed it up
Speed up, speed up
Speed up, speed up
I don't wanna waste my time
I don't wanna waste my time
I don't wanna waste my time
Speed up, speed up, speed it up
You need to step on the gas

Oh you're moving way too slow
You need to step on the gas
Accelerate that, way too laid back
Accelerate that, slow motion ain't gonna get you nowhere
Speed up, speed up
It ain't gonna get you nowhere
Speed up, speed up, accelerate that
