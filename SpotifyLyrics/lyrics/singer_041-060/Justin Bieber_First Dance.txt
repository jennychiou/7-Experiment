(It's your chance, take her hand to the floor)
Fellas, it's the moment you've been waiting for
(Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know)
Ladies, I know you're ready
(Cause you only got one chance for your first dance)
Yeah, yeah, you never forget your first dance
(So take advantage of the slow jam)
Tell 'em JB

When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)
Here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
I'm gon' cherish every moment (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

"'Usher"'
It's your chance, take her hand
To the floor, to the floor
Girl if you see some and you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance
For your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah, man

"'Justin Bieber"'
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
