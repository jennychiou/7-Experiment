Flatline, flatline, flatline, flatline
Lately you've been busy
Wonderin' if you miss me
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know
How come you act so different?
Talk to me-I'll listen
All the love I'm givin', don't act like you don't know

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl you always catch me at the bad time (bad time)
When I know you probably think it's a lie (a lie)
And I know I told you last time was the last time (last time)
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline (flatline)?
Flatline (flatline), flatline (flatline)
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline (flatline)?
When I hit you, you don't even reply (reply)
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline?

Not breathin', what is it that I'm not seein'
Said she's leavin', damn I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleedin'
Knowin' that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what Imma do now

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl you always catch me at the bad time (bad time)
