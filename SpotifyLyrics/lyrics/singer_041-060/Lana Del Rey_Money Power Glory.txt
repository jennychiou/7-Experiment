You say that you wanna go to a land
That's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?

You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
Not what I want at all

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got, baby

The sun also rises
On those who fail the call
My life, it comprises
Of losses and wins and fails and falls

I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-b-b-b-baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got, baby, baby

Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds, diamonds
Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds, that's all that I want
Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds, diamonds
Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds, diamonds

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got, baby, baby
Baby, baby
