Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us
Someday, a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care

Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere

There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, someday, somewhere
