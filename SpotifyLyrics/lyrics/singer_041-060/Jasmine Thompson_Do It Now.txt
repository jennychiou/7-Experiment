Silence is my worst
Silence is my worst
My worst enemy
All I do is just
All I do is just
Revisit this memory

Cause you can't take back what you didn't say
If I could do it now
Do it now
I would do it now
Cause you can't break promises you never made
If I could do it now
Do it now
I would do it now

Woah
Put your best suit on and carry on now
Woah
Don't be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping the videos on replay
People will go but feelings they stay
Woah
If I had a second chance at love
I would do it now

Sorry doesn't work
Sorry doesn't work
If it's a thing you say everyday
Feelings that come back
Feelings that come back
Never went away
No they never went away

Cause you can't take back what you didn't say
If I could do it now
Do it now
I would do it now
Can you give back the breath that you took away
Won't you do it now
Do it now
Won't you do it now

Woah
Put your best suit on and carry on now
Woah
Don't be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping the videos on replay
People will go but feelings they stay
Woah
If I had a second chance at love
I would do it now

Woah
Put your best suit on and carry on now
Woah
Don't be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping the videos on replay
People will go but feelings they stay
Woah
If I had a second chance at love
I would do it now
