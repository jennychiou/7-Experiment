He said he couldn't wait to get me alone
I got him caught up, now he's in my song
His word plays nice but I shouldn't assume
Let's see what he can do, show me something brand new
I can tell that he thinks I'm the truth
Gettin' into him start to find me a groove
He's claiming he can make me sing out of tune
Make me blow out a fuse, really tryin' to get loose

Tell me if I put it on ya baby could you handle it
If I put it on ya baby could you handle it
Uh huh could you handle it
Uh huh could you handle it

I know that liquor got you talkin' real slick
But I'mma pull your card and see if you're bluffin'
Claimin' you can make me sing out of tune
Make me blow out a fuse, really tryin' to get loose

Tell me if I put it on ya baby could you handle it
If I put it on ya baby could you handle it
Uh huh could you handle it
Uh huh could you handle it

I got him sweatin' hard now he's losing his cool
Mesmerised by my curves and the way that I move
His body's sayin' things but I shouldn't assume
Let's see what he can do, show me something brand new
Check my silhouette I know you're diggin' the view
Especially when I throw it back at you
He's claiming he can make me sing out of tune
Make me blow out a fuse, really tryin' to get loose

Tell me if I put it on ya baby could you handle it
If I put it on ya baby could you handle it
Uh huh could you handle it
Uh huh could you handle it

You should know by now I ain't the one to play with
You see how I get down and the way I handle it
If I put it on ya boy you know you're gonna trip
You say you can handle it, then handle it
