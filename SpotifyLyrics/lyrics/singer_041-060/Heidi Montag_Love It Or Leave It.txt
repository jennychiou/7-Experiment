I'm gonna blow right past ya
Like I don't even know ya
'Cause your bringing me down down down down
Take a picture it might last longer
I won't be hanging around round round
Walk through the clubs party that's what you wanted
I light up night night night
I get this thing started if your laying broken hearted
I'm doing it right right right

I don't care that's how I (move)
Love it or leave it that's how I (move)
And don't you mess with my (love it or leave it)

I said it said it said it said it
Love it or leave it
If you don't get it you don't get it
Love it or leave it

Independent women with an eye for the lime life
Seeking short term relationship highlights
Likes to have fun and kiss under the moonlight
But not your average house wife

I'm an important lady
When I show up they pay me
Pass the check to the right
I don't need you to save me I know that some people hate me
Just living my life

I don't care that's how I (move)
Love it or leave it that's how I (move)
And don't you mess with my (love it or leave it)

I said it said it said it said it
Love it or leave it
If you don't get it you don't get it
Love it or leave it

Sometimes I max out your credit card
Sometimes a lapdance might be in order

I said it said it said it said it
Love it or leave it
If you don't get it you don't get it
Love it or leave it

You know that I'm the one that activates ya
I'll give up something that just captivates ya
I'm unpredictable and very uncontrollable
Baby if you don't understand it, it might be time to roll

I don't care that's how I (move)
Love it or leave it that's how I (move)
And don't you mess with my (love it or leave it)

I said it said it said it said it
Love it or leave it
If you don't get it you don't get it
Love it or leave it
I said it said it said it said it
Love it or leave it
If you don't get it you don't get it
Love it or leave it
I said it said it said it said it
Love it or leave it
If you don't get it you don't get it
Love it or leave it
I said it said it said it said it
Love it or leave it
If you don't get it you don't get it
Love it or leave it
