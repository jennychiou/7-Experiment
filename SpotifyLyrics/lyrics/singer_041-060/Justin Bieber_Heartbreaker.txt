Girl you don't know how I feel (how I really feel)
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call (take my call), if I got you today
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone

And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby

Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause girl I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet later on the low

Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking

Girl you see me here standing here
Standing in the rain
Any chance that you could stay right here
And never go away

You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone

And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby

Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause girl I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet later on the low

Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking

So what I'm really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around
But this is, this is personal, this is for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And I know the seasons may change
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that

I still believe in us
I still believe in love
I still believe in us
I hope you believe in love
The way I believe in us

You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I'm feelin'
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I, the way that I

You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
Be careful with your heart
