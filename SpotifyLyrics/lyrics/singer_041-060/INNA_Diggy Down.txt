Hey, boy
I really love the way
That you move
You wind me up
Up, up on you

You know I'm down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down

Down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down, down
Down

Slow down
Eh what you hidin'
Am I invited
I wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know, wanna know

Headlights
You wanna night drive
I got my skin tight
You wanna go, wanna go
Wanna, go wanna go

No one has to know
It can just be you and me alone
Get yourself a ticket to the show
And I let you, let you

Hey, boy
I really love the way
That you move
You wind me up
Up, up on you

You know I'm down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down

Down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down, down
Down

Hey, boy
I really love the way
That you move
You wind me up
Up, up on you

You know I'm down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down

Down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down, down
Down

Closer
I wanna know ya
You be my soldier
You wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try

Lights out
We gotta slow down
You wanna now how
We come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive

No one has to know
It can just be you and me alone
Get yourself a ticket to the show
And I let you, let you

Hey, boy
I really love the way
That you move
You wind me up
Up, up on you

You know I'm down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down

Down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down, down
Down

Hey, boy
I really love the way
That you move
You wind me up
Up, up on you

You know I'm down
Diggy, Diggy down
Diggy, Diggy down
