(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)

Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

These are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us, it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel

And these are real things
Yeah, these are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us, it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you

These are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
And then there is you
(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
And then there is you
(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
And then there is you
(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
