My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California, too
He drives a Chevy Malibu

And when he calls, he calls for me
And not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs
He loves his baby, too

But I can't fix him
Can't make him better
And I can't do nothing
About his strange weather

But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, one is blue

And when he calls, he calls for me
And not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace
And maybe someone new

But I can't help him
Can't make him better
And I can't do nothing
About his strange weather

'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Your hot, hot, weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot, weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover

You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling

You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
