Juice, juice is temporary, you know
Anyone can obtain the juice or something
I mean, you could say that just 'cause you got a nice car or something
Like, "Oh, man, he got the juice," you know
It's something that kind of comes and goes
But the sauce, the sauce is forever

Ooh, sauce
Uh, you got all of it
Yeah
You know, you got all of it
You got all of it
Go 'head

Ooh, I love your pink, you like my purple
You must be God herself, can I come worship?
Let's make some new details, just for your journal
'Cause you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

So, go ahead, say I won't
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

Ooh, I love your pink, you like my purple
That color right between those, that's where I worship
Let's make some new details up in your journal
'Cause you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

So, go ahead, say I won't
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

Four times, huh
Yeah, break it down, woo!
Uh huh
So, so, so, go ahead, say I won't

Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me (over me)
It's always loose screws when you get close to me (yeah)
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

Uh, ooh, sauce
You got all of it, go 'head
Ooh, sauce
Go 'head, you got all of it, huh
Ooh, sauce
Uh, yeah, you got all of it, go 'head
Ooh, sauce
Go 'head, you got all of it, uh
