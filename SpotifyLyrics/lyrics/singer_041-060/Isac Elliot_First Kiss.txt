Girl I'll be your lollipop, your sugar rush
Tease you when you're with your friends and make you blush
Baby let me turn into your teenage crush
If I could be your first

Girl I wouldn't wanna leave you alone
I'd call you up, say what's up on the phone
Hang with you after school and walk you home
If I could be your first

I see you
'You're looking so fine'
You see me
'Will you be mine?'
Girl take the first step with me
Take it with me tonight, oh

I wanna' be your first kiss, first kiss
I know you wanna' feel like this, like this
Girl I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss, first kiss

I wanna be your first kiss

I'll tag you at my show so your friends can see
Girl you need to know I don't fall easily
I wish I could be your first

I see you
"You're looking so fine"
You see me
"Will you be mine?"
Girl take the first step with me
Take it with me tonight, ooh

I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I know you wanna feel like this, like this
Girl I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss, first kiss

I wanna be your first kiss
I wanna take you, take you, take you
Far and beyond
I wanna take you, take you, take you
Up, up the stars, o-ooh
I'll let nothing, nothing, nothing get in our way
It's just you and me, babe
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your first kiss
