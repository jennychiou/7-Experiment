You made a mess and now my heart is an open wound
Oh, no
How do we save something when there's nothing left to lose?
Oh, oh
And when you're there, don't care
I know it just ain't right
I told myself from the start that I don't need you

But then I fall back under
I get the feeling, back to that summer
No matter what it is you keep me falling under
I get that feeling, feeling for your love
But when I'm alone I know
I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you
I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you
Round and round we go
Round and round in circles
It's an never ending road
But when I'm alone I know
I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you
I spend my days just repeating the same old scene

Uhm, yeah
Watch your light slip away, I feel angry in me, you know

But then I fall back under
I get the feeling, back to that summer
No matter what it is you keep me falling under
I get that feeling, feeling for your love
But when I'm alone I know
I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you
I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you
Round and round we go
Round and round in circles
It's an never ending road
But when I'm alone I know
I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you

Then I fall back under

I get the feeling, back to that summer

No matter what it is you keep me falling under

I get that feeling, feeling for your love

But when I'm alone

I I I I I can't see myself with no one else
Can't see myself with no one, but you
I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you

Round and round we go,

Round and round in circles

It's an never ending road

But when I'm alone I know

I I I I I can't see myself with no one else

Can't see myself with no one, but you.
