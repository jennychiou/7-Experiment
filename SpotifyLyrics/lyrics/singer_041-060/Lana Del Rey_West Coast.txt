Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
If you're not drinking, then you're not playing
But you got the music, you got the music in you
Don't you?

Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling
Like it all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment, boy blue
Yeah, you

You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me the most, I say "I miss you so much"
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
"Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love"

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
"Move baby, move baby, I'm in love"

(I'm in love) I'm in love (I'm in love)
(Mic check, one two, two, two, get it, girl)

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
The silver starlets, their queens of Saigons
And you've got the music, you've got the music in you
Don't you?

Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their Golden Gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you got the music, you got the music in you
Don't you?

You push me hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo cari√±o, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
"Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love"

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
"Move baby, move baby, I'm in love"

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
"Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love"

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
"Move baby, move baby, I'm in love"
I'm in love
I'm in love
