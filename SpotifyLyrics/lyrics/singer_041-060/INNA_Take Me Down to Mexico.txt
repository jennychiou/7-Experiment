I wanna dance, yo quiero bailar
Turning, turn me up
Buy me a pina colada
Gotta keep me up like the sun
Baby, it's you and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea
You and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea

Let's run away, away tonight
Let's jump the border, the border line
Anywhere we can free our minds
We can fall in love, we control the night

So if you wanna go there we can go there
And if you wanna go, I'll go with you
And I don't give a damn if we gon' know it
Baby just as long as I'm with you

I wanna dance, yo quiero bailar
Turning, turn me up
Buy me a pina colada
Gotta keep me up like the sun
Baby, it's you and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea
You and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea

I wanna wake up by the beach
With your arms surrounding me
We'll live it up like we're in a dream
Will you take me down? Make my body scream

So if you wanna go there we can go there
And if you wanna go, I'll go with you
And I don't give a damn if we gon' know it
Baby just as long as I'm with you

I wanna dance, yo quiero bailar
Turning, turn me up
Buy me a pina colada
Gotta keep me up like the sun
Baby, it's you and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea
You and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea

You'll be my dream, my dream
I'll be the astronaut
You'll wear a wet bikini, I'll be the pokadots
Bonjo, I want you baby
(You say you're loco loco loco loco)

I wanna dance, yo quiero bailar
Turning, turn me up
Buy me a pina colada
Gotta keep me up like the sun
Baby, it's you and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea
You and me, you and me
Take me down to Mexico, yea
