Try to remember
The kind of September
When life was slow
And oh, so mellow

Try to remember
The kind of September
When grass was green
And grain so yellow

Try to remember
The kind of September
When you were a young
And gallow fellow

Try to remember
And, if you remember
Then follow

Try to remember
When life was so tender
That no one wept
Except the willow

Try to remember
When life was so tender
That dreams were kept
Beside your pillow

Try to remember
When life was so tender
That love was an ember
About to billow

Try to remember
And, if you remember
Then follow

Deep in December
It's nights to remember
Although you know
The snow will follow

Deep in December
It's nights to remember
Without a hurt
The heart is hollow

Deep in December
It's nights to remember
The fire in September
That made you mellow

Deep in December
Our hearts should remember
Then follow

Then follow
