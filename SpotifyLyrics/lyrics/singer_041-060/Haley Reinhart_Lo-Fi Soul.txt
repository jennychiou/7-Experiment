He's got a lo-fi soul
He won't let me go
Black and white with a hint of gold
Tells me things that I oughta now
I've got a lo-fi soul
Or so I've been told
Taken back by the days of old
Sending chills right to my bones

Mmm la la la
Mmm la la la
Mmm la la la

He's got a lo-fi soul
Ooh, our new love, it feels so old
Don't worry, baby, it's a good thing
I know that you know

The way that you move, well, it speaks to me
It sings to me, it swings with me, and it's all that I need
It started out with just one glass and quiet gazes
Soon enough we finished each other's phrases
We just met, yet I've loved you lifetimes before
Familiar feelings
Ooh, how I adore

He's got a lo-fi soul
He won't let me go
Black and white with a hint of gold
Tells me things that I ougtha know
I've got a lo-fi soul
Or so I've been told
Taken back by the days of old
Sending chills right to my bones

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

He's got a lo-fi soul
Sending chills right to my bones

There's something about a little mystery
It keeps me questioning how far back we go in history
Victorian houses or life on the seas
You never know how many times we spoke of nights like these

It started out with just one glass and quiet gazes
Soon enough we finished each other's phrases
We just met, yet I've loved you lifetimes before
Familiar feelings
Ooh, how I adore

He likes, he likes
My type, my type
And I like, I like
What he likes, he likes

He likes my type
I like what he likes

He's got a lo-fi soul
He won't let me go
Black and white with a hint of gold
Tells me things that I ougtha know
I've got a lo-fi soul
Or so I've been told
Taken back by the days of old
Sending chills right to my bones

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

He's got a lo-fi soul

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

He's got a lo-fi soul
Sending chills right to my bones
