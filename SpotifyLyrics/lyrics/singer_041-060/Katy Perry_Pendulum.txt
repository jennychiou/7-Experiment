You got patina, ain't so green, no
You earned this spot, got your receipts, yeah
Funny, gotta add addendums to your dreams
Still you never sleep, no, you never sleep, ah
Oh, you learned to dance, to bob and weave, yeah
To let that water roll off easy
Yeah, you grew yourself above the weeds
Taller than the trees, oh

So don't try and reinvent your wheel
'Cause you're too original
Baby, just stay classic
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

It's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It's a pendulum)
Life's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It all comes back)
(It all comes back)

So just take those punches on the chin, yeah
Don't fight the changes in the wind, no
'Cause you'll find your way home, oh
If you find a way to let go...just let go

Don't try and reinvent your wheel
'Cause you're too original
Baby, just stay classic
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

It's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It's a pendulum)
Life's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It all comes back)
(It all comes back)

There is no need to worry
The pages keep on turning
And it goes on and on
Comes all the way around
There is no need to hurry
If there's a fire burning
'Cause it goes on and on
Comes all the way around

All the way around, around
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

It's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It's a pendulum)
Life's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It all comes back)
(It all comes back)

It's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It's a pendulum)
Life's a pendulum, it all comes back around
(It's a pendulum)
(It all comes back)
(It all comes back)
