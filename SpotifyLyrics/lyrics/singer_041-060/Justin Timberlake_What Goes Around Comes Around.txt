Hey girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand

So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry

It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah

Now girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)

Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it, no
Don't want to talk about it, hmm
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it, uh
Feeling the blues about it, yeah
I just can't do without you
Can you tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
Shoulda known better that you were gonna make me cry

Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around yeah

What goes around comes around, yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that

What goes around comes around, yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that

Don't want to think about it, huh
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
Shoulda known better that you were gonna make me cry

It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Now it's breaking my heart
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around yeah

Yo, yo
Let me paint this picture for you baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone

I heard you find out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
You'll see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey

See?
You should listen to me, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because...
(What goes around comes back around)
