Oh oh
Just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to show me the light
Not just for the meanwhile
For a long long time, better believe it

Oh oh
Whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missin' my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
Till you're back again oh yeah yeah

You think I'm biased
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missin' my lover

Got a whole lotta texts on my phone and I don't reply
The next eight bars tell you why

You're all that matters to me yeah yeah
Worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me yeah yeah

What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no I in team
To make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Take the gas out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you and only you

Oh oh
Grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

You're all that matters to me yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me yeah yeah

What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no I in team
To make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You're all that matters to me
