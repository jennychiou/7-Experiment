Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
You got your money now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything
Nothing could stop the two of us
Let's just get lost, that's what we want

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Dive in, dive deep, and dive blue my sweet,
Brushing up from the water where the ice meets,
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away, but
Nothing could stop the two of us
If that's what we want, we could just get lost

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Do you like,
Do you like where you've been
Where you're going to (going to)
Say good night
Say goodnight to the life and the world you knew
I'm gonna follow you

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
