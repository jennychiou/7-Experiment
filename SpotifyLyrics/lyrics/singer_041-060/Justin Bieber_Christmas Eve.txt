It's a holiday (yeah, yeah yeah)

Spend it with you baby
I think that I'm in love this Christmas, yeah
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace
You know that Santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh ride now
So today is all about you baby
The mistletoe can pull us close
That's what I'm waiting for
It sort of feels like it's Valentines, Valentines
So I land on top of your roof
Them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you
Them carols are singing
Japan to Peru
Baby me and you
This Christmas Eve

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday my dream
Lay your head on me
I got you babe whoa
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this Christmas Eve

You leave some cookies out
Imma eat em all
Nobody can see me but you
It's so magical
When we use imagination
We can fly to Never Never Land
The North Pole ain't that cold
If you wanna go
I got you baby

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday my dream
Lay your head on me
I got you babe whoa
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this Christmas Eve

Be my, be my Christmas Eve
Be my, be my Christmas Eve
Be my, be my Christmas Eve
I promise I won't do you wrong

Be my date this Christmas Eve (be my baby)
Be my holiday my dream
Lay your head on me
I got you babe whoa no no no
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this Christmas Eve

Be my, be my Christmas Eve
Be my, be my Christmas Eve
B-B-B-Be, be, be
Be my, be my Christmas Eve
B-B-B-Be
