I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protection my heart truly
I got lost in the sound

I hear in my mind all this voices
I hear in the mind all this words
I hear in my mind all this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks me heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

Suppose I never meet you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you
Kiss me so sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose we never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall

Never love nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds

I hear in my mind all this voices
I hear in my mind all this music
I hear in my mind all this words
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
I hear in my mind all this voices
I hear in my mind all this music
I hear in my mind all this words
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
Breaks my heart
