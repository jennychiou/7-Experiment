Everything is fine now
Let sleeping dogs lay
All our minds made up now
All our beds are made
No one's out of time, no
Chips fall wherever they may
Leave it all behind, let the ocean wash away

It never was about
The money or the drugs
For you there's only love
For you there's only love
It never was about
The party or the clubs
For you there's only love

'Cause you're my religion,
You're how I'm living
When all my friends say
I should take some space
Well I can't envision
That for a minute
When I'm down on my knees
You're how I pray

Hallelujah
I need your love
Hallelujah
I need your love

Everything is bright now -
No more cloudy days, even when
The storms come, in the eye we'll stay
No need to survive now -
All we do is play, all I hear is
Music like Lay Lady Lay

It never was about the money or the drugs
With you there's only love
With you there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you there's only love

'Cause you're my religion,
You're how I'm living
When all my friends say
I should take some space
Well I can't envision
That for a minute
When I'm down on my knees
You're how I pray

Hallelujah
I need your love
Hallelujah
I need your love

You're my religion,
You're how I'm living
When all my friends say
I should take some space
Well I can't envision
That for a minute
When I'm down on my knees
You're how I pray

Hallelujah
I need your love
Hallelujah
I need your love
