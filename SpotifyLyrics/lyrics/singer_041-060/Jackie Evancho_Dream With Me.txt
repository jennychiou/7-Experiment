If I could capture the moon
And paint a sky full of blue
I'd plant two stars
To light the night

If I could skip along clouds
Until the wind sing out loud
Rewrite the rhyme
And slow down time

I see a world where a world
Where every boy and girl
Has all they need to live free

Imagine a world that's kind
With not a child left behind
Where everyone could share the sun

Life is all I adore
Dream with me
