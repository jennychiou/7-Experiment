Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that, baby, bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that, baby, bump that track

Groove, slam, work it back
Space Cowboy just play that track
Gaga in the room, so starstruck
Cherry cherry cherry cherry boom boom

Rollin' out to the club on the weekend
Stylin' out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize on the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Cue me up, I'm the twelve on your table
I'm so starstruck

I'm so starstruck, struck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so (starstruck)
(Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up)
I'm so starstruck, struck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so (starstruck)
(Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up)

Baby now that we're alone, got a request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?
Got your Dre headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch me back and forth back and forth, uh-huh

Put your hands on my waist pull the fader
Run it back with the original flavor
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus to the verse (frika frika reverse)

I'm so starstruck, struck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so (starstruck)
(Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up)
I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so (starstruck)
(Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up)

Hey, li'l mamma like really really is that him?
I haven't seen you before and you've got all them big rims
Into that cash flow, I'm a fan of you, don't trip
Shawty say, hand over you signature right here

Like it's just a dotted line and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I should have had an overdose, too many Starbucks

Ain't never seen a baller, paper that's that taller
Stunners that let their top back on their Chevy Impalas
Hummers and all that fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?

But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
So please swagger, they're gonna dagger
Got what she want, shawty happily ever after

I'm so starstruck, struck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so (starstruck)
(Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up)
I'm so starstruck (struck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so (starstruck)
(Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up)
