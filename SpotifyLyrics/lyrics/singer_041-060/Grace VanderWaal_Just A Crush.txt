You're looking at me
I'm looking at you
This is never gonna sort itself out
I don't know what will do

'Cause you're talking 'bout a marriage
And a life together
But honey I'm not looking for anything like
What you're searching for, oh

You're just
Just
Just
You're just a crush

I hope you understand
What I'm trying to tell you
I don't wanna be confusing
With anything that I do
I guess it would be nice
To hold hands once in a while
But you're over here
Planning like wild

Yes, you're talking 'bout a marriage
And a life together
But honey I'm not looking for anything like
What you're searching for, oh

You're just
Just
Just
You are

No, I don't wanna hold tears
It'd be worse if I faked you out all of these years
I know this may be hard to hear
So let me just say it perfectly clear

You're just
Just
Just
You are
You are
Just a crush
