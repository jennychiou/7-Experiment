They call me crazy but I'm just waiting
For the world around me to change
I'm thinking maybe if we look in time
We'll find the love and peace of mind

Can see the halos, can't feel the wings low
But I've got faith that the angels will see

Walking on heaven, walking on heaven
Streets are now in painted gold
Walking on heaven, waking on heaven
Free your mind and let it go

So call it lazy but all that I'm saying
Is please, don't waste your time
You keep hating
But why not try saving the love?

Can see the halos, can't feel the wings low
But I've got faith that the angels will see

Some say we're tripping
But we're just believing
