My own love said to me
My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind
She went away from me
And this she did say
It will not be long 
Till our wedding day

She went away from me
And she moved through the fair
And slowly I watched her
Move here and move there
She went her way homeward
With one star awake
As this swan in the evening
Moves over the lake

I dreamed last night
That my own love came in
She came in so sweetly
Her feet made no din
She came close beside me
And this this she did say
It will not be long love
Till our wedding day
