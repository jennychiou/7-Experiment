Can you hear me
I call your name twice
Can you feel me
I treat you so nice
When you're not here
I feel it's getting cold
Come around me
And you will see my world

Move with me to the left
And then move it, move it
Move with me to the right

Move with me to the left
And then move it, move it
Move with me to the right

Just dance, just dance
Just dance, just dance

So sexy
So sexy

Move with me to the left
And then move it, move it
Move with me to the right

Move with me to the left
And then move it, move it
Move with me to the right

Just dance, just dance
Just dance, just dance

So sexy

Move with me to the left
And then move it, move it
Move with me to the right

Move with me to the left
And then move it, move it
Move with me to the right

Just dance, just dance
Just dance, just dance

Just dance, just dance
Just dance, just dance
