Everybody in the club is famous
No matter who you are, just celebrate it
So turn it up and keep it going
On and on 'cause we are one

Beautiful, proud, get loud, the music's right
Get on the floor, some more, feel the love inside
'Cause for tonight, tonight, we're all the same
Just do it like nobody's watching you

Don't stop believing, tonight we are one
If you get in the moment, you've already won
Don't stop believing, tonight we are one
If you're lookin' for a ami, you you you just found one

Oh whoa
Everybody in the club is famous
No matter who you are, just celebrate it
So turn it up and keep it going
On and on 'cause we are one
(x2)

Oh whoa, oh whoa oh oh
Oh whoa, oh whoa oh oh
Oh whoa, oh whoa oh oh
Oh whoa, oh whoa oh oh

Don't stop it now, get down, have another round
Reach for the lights, and have the time of your life
'Cause for tonight, tonight, we're all the same
Just do it like nobody's watching you

Don't stop believing, tonight we are one
If you get in the moment, you've already won
Don't stop believing, tonight we are one
If you're lookin' for an ami, you you you just found one

Oh whoa
Everybody in the club is famous
No matter who you are, just celebrate it
So turn it up and keep it going
On and on 'cause we are one

Oh whoa
Everybody in the club is famous
No matter who you are, just celebrate it
So turn it up and keep it going
On and on 'cause we are one

So turn it up and keep it going
On and on 'cause we are one...
