'Cause it's all over inside
I'm waiting for love again, saying to myself
What I feel about you, When no one arrives
I stare at my phone again, put it to my ear
Why pretend when it's through?

So baby tonight
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
Baby tonight
I already know
I'm letting you go

Cause tonight
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
Baby tonight
I already know
I'm letting you go
Go, go, go, go, go, go...

Don't you know rule number one
Gotta make me feel wanted
Don't ever flaunt it, flaunt it
Many other guys wanna try
Wanna die to jump on it

So, baby tonight
I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
Baby, Tonight
I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go

See it's all in my eyes
Can't hide so why pretend?
Wanna tell the world how I feel about you
It's building inside
I'm thinking of where and when
Running out of time
So I gotta cut through

So baby tonight
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
Baby, tonight
I already know
I'm letting you go
Cause tonight
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
Baby, tonight
I already know I'm letting you go
Go, go, go, go, go, go...

Don't you know rule number one
Gotta make me feel wanted
Don't ever flaunt it, flaunt it
Many other guys wanna try
Wanna die to jump on it

So, baby tonight
I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
Baby, tonight
I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go

So, baby tonight
I'm letting you know
I'm letting you go
Baby, tonight
Already know
I'm letting you go
