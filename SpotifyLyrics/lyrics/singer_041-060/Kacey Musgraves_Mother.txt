Bursting with empathy, I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors

Wish we didn't live, wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother, mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother, mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother, mother
