So beautiful
Got me wrapped around her finger
She's mystical
She's the magic, I'm the wizard

She's so sweet
I must be dreaming
It's unreal
The way she's glowing
Don't you know
Baby you're a stunner

It's amazing how you
Glitter glitter glitter so bright
Just like in a movie
What you doing to me?
Girl, you glitter glitter glitter alright
And when you're smiling
My heart is dancing, oh
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)
Woah oh, woah oh

So natural
You don't need no make-up
It's incredible
You're so good you could be made up

She's so sweet
I must be dreaming
Oh my god
I think I'm dying
Don't you know
Baby you're a stunner

It's amazing how you
Glitter glitter glitter so bright
Just like in a movie
What you doing to me?
Girl, you glitter glitter glitter alright
And when you're smiling
My heart is dancing, oh
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)

I'll buy you all the shiny pears
You're my diamond girl
I'll fight for you till I fall
And when you're walking in
Yeah you're sparkling
Just like a disco-ball

It's amazing how you
Glitter glitter glitter so bright
Just like in a movie
What you doing to me?
Glitter glitter glitter alright
And when you're smiling
My heart is dancing, oh

How you glitter glitter glitter so bright
Just like in a movie
What you doing to me?
Girl, you glitter glitter glitter alright
And when you're smiling
My heart is dancing, oh
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)
Woah oh, woah oh (glitter)
