Let's go
Woke up Mexico
Tan lines
Here we go

Gin fizz
In my glass
Shake, shake
Shake, shake the shack

We meet all the cats
New scene fade to black
Bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop

Bop, bop
Bop, bop, bop

Milkshakes on the rack
Just dancing in the street
Hands up holler back
And c'mon dance with me
Hot hands on your hips
And work it baby please

One kiss on the lips
It's summer by the sea
By the sea
By the sea

Wake up
It's time to blend
Everything
Throw the juices in
Mix it up till it's bubbling
Now your tripping of the good

Get you rocking
Like an animal
Always ready babyË‡
Locked and loaded

Bop, bop

Hot hands on your hips

Hands against the wall
Mr. Officer
I don't know nothing
That is the truth

So how you gonna move

That's cool if that's true
