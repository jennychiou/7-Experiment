Rising above tension below
Learn from the in-between
Blinded by trust, asleep to the truth
Awakened by disbelief
Somewhere I found strength in my soul
Still you refuse to see

Are you sure I'm not all right?
'Cause lately I've been feeling fine!
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens
But I have seen you run in circles, unforgiven
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?!
Oh, you're a machine!

A world of your own
Hollow inside
Careful when worlds collide
I'm filling my life
With all it can hold
Carry it on with pride

Are you sure I'm not all right?
Cause lately I've been feeling fine!
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens
But I have seen you run in circles, unforgiven
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?!
Oh, you're a machine!

The sun's still above
All the rain that's coming down
And I can feel the clouds drifting away
And now the sky is open wide!

Turn the light on, you will see things
So much clearer, oh
But there's no heart; oh, there's no heart!
And I've spent all this time feeling something you can't feel at all!
You're a machine!
Oh, you're a machine.
