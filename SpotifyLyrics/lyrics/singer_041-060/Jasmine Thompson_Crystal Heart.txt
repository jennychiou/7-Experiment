I see the world in stars and laser beams
The future's bright in my kaleidoscope of dreams

I feel so shatterproof 'til you look me in the eyes
Somehow you see my truth like particles of light

So shine a light through me
I will let you in, let you in
But I can break so easily
Underneath the skin, 'neath the skin
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crystal, crystal heart

I'll take a leap of faith don't let me fall
You always raise me up by breaking down my walls

I feel so shatterproof 'til you look me in the eyes
Somehow you see my truth like particles of light

So shine a light through me
I will let you in, let you in
But I can break so easily
Underneath the skin, 'neath the skin
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crystal, crystal heart

Shine your light through me, I won't hide
But you can't help falling if you don't mind

So shine a light through me
I will let you in, let you in
But I can break so easily
Underneath the skin, 'neath the skin
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crystal, crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crys-crys-crystal heart
I've got a crystal, crystal heart
