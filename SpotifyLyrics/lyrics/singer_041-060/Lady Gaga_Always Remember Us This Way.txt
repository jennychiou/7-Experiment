That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how to rhyme but damn we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory baby yeah

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way
