Standing so close but we're far away
Tired of waiting on circumstance to change
I tried it all, running outta ways
Sick of searching for the right time and place

I just wanna change the tempo
But you're always trying to slow it down
Tired of being stuck in a red zone, red zone, oh
The way the body moves, so vicious
Make me wanna touch right here and now
I just wanna close the distance, distance, oh

But she won't notice
I can't help myself, I can't help myself
And she won't notice
'Til there's someone else, 'til there's someone else
I guess you're missing all
My good and bad intensions
Guess I'm invisible
'Til you lose my attention
And she won't notice
'Til there's someone else, 'til there's someone else

Turn my attention a night away
Now you wanna act like I'm yours to claim (oh no)
Guess you don't like I'm in second place
You don't like the fact that she's in the way

I just wanna change the tempo
But you're always trying to slow it down
Tired of being stuck in a red zone, red zone, oh
The way the body moves, so vicious
Make me wanna touch right here and now
I just wanna close the distance, distance, oh

But she won't notice (no)
I can't help myself, I can't help myself
And she won't notice (no)
'Til there's someone else, 'til there's someone else
I guess you're missing all
My good and bad intensions
Guess I'm invisible
'Til you lose my attention
And she won't notice (she won't notice)
'Til there's someone else, 'til there's someone else

I just wanna change the tempo
But you're always trying to slow it down
Tired of being stuck in a red zone, red zone, oh
The way the body moves, so vicious
Make me wanna touch right here and now
I just wanna close the distance, distance, oh

But she won't notice (she won't notice)
I can't help myself (oh no), I can't help myself (oh)
And she won't notice (yeah)
'Til there's someone else, 'til there's someone else (else)
I guess you're missing all
My good and bad intensions
Guess I'm invisible
'Til you lose my attention
And she won't notice
'Til there's someone else, 'til there's someone else
