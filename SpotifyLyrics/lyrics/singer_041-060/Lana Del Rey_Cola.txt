My pussy taste like Pepsi Cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I got'sa taste for men who are older
It's always been, so it's no surprise

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive alive)
All he wants to do is
Party with his pretty baby, yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side

We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, baby, woah-oh, oh-yeah

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge alligiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive alive)
All he wants to do is
Party with his pretty baby, yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side

We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Drugs suck it up like vanilla icys
Don't treat me rough
Treat me really niceys

Decorate my neck
Diamantes ices
Why? Come on, come on

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, yeah!

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on
Come on, baby
Come on, come on

Woah-oh, woah-oh
