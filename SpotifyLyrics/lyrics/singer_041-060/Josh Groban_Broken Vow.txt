Tell me his name, I want to know
The way he looks and where you go
I need to see his face, I need to understand
Why you and I came to an end

Tell me again, I want to hear
Who broke my faith in all these years
Who lays with you at night while I'm here all alone
Remembering when I was your own

I let you go, I let you fly
Why do I keep on asking why?
I let you go, now that I've found a way to keep somehow
More than a broken vow

Tell me the words I never said
Show me the tears you never shed
Give me the touch, the one you promised to be mine
Or has it vanished for all time?

I let you go, I let you fly
Why do I keep on asking why?
I let you go, now that I've found a way to keep somehow
More than a broken vow

I close my eyes
And dream of you and I and then I realize
There's more to love than only bitterness and lies
I close my eyes
Well, I'd give away my soul to hold you once again
And never let those moments end

I let you go, I let you fly
Now that I know, I'm asking why
I let you go, now that I've found a way to keep somehow
More than a broken vow
