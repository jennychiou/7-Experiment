More is more
On the dance floor
It's fucking chaos in here
More is more
Than you asked for
It's fucking chaos in here

I'm good to go, got my girls in tow
I've been waiting all week to get high

Forget the plans, with your man, at your hand
There's plenty of that kinda guy where I'm goin'

More drinks
More skin showin'
More lights glowin'
It's an endless supply

Never too much, of a good thing baby
You don't need to be asking me why, no

More is more
On the dance floor
It's fucking chaos in here
More is more
Than you asked for
It's fucking chaos in here
Hook me up, with a Jack 'n' Coke and let it flow
Till the end of the night
It's automatic that I jones like an addict
I could overdose on you tonight

More touch, less talk
Keep it up, boy
This is my favorite part

When I get started
There's no more I wish about it
I just gonna do what I like
(Believe it)

More is more
On the dance floor
It's fucking chaos in here
More is more
Than you asked for
It's fucking chaos in here

More you, more me
More of what we been doin' naturally

More this, more that
Oh boy, you're makin' me love
Yeah, you're makin' me love

Excessive, gimme extra in addition to what I got
Yeah, I get a lot
I can never get enough, so much goin' on
This night is gettin' so rough

More is more
On the dance floor
It's fucking chaos in here
More is more
Than you asked for
It's fucking chaos in here
