You keep calling, you keep calling
Saying that you want it back
All my loving, all my loving
But you can't, you can't
You keep trying, you keep trying
With that sweet talk on your tongue
But I'm not buying, I'm not buying

Yeah, you ripped it up and you chewed it
And the more you talk, you prove it
Yeah, you prove it

That damn, you're such a
Did you think that I would let you
Crawl right back into my bedroom
After everything we've been through
I know the truth

That damn, you're such a
Difficult little Devil
Trying to put it back together
'Cause you see I'm doing better
Without you now

Damn, you're such a
Da da di da da, da da di da da
Damn, you're such a
Da da di da da

See you smoking, see you smoking
Those electric cigarettes
Are you joking? Are you joking?

'Cause you had your chance and you blew it
Yeah, you ripped it up and you chewed it
And the more you talk, you prove it
Yeah, you prove it

That damn, you're such a
Did you think that I would let you
Crawl right back into my bedroom
After everything we've been through
I know the truth

That damn, you're such a
Difficult little Devil
Trying to put it back together
'Cause you see I'm doing better
Without you now

Damn, you're such a
Da da di da da, da da di da da

Without you now

You can take your lies to your next girlfriend
'Cause I don't wanna hear it anymore
And if you're all that's left when the whole world ends
No I still don't wanna hear it anymore
