Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your wish
Every day the clouds clear more and more
Listen to my heart, can you hear it sing?
Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around with you
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather,
And stars may collide
But I love you (I love you)
Until the end of time (until the end of time)

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Oh, come what may, come what may
I will love you,
Oh I will love you
Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day
