Everywhere I turn there's bombs going off
Just total chaos all around me
Smoke all in the air there's casualties of love
Broken hearts laying everywhere

But it don't scare me at all
I've got my armour on
Damn right I'm ready for battle
I know it's dangerous, right now I'm strong enough
I'm pushing through to you
Baby I'm on my way and I'll fight for you

I'll do what I gotta do yeah I'll fight for you, I'll fight for you
I'd risk my life dying on the frontline for you, I'll fight for you
For your love, I'd fight for your heart
Go to war to be next to you
And no I won't stop till you're mine boy
I'll fight for you, I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you

Okay I'm going in better take cover, better yet find another 'cause this one's for me
There's bound to be some warfare I don't care
'Cause the way I feel about him I'm gonna go there

But it don't scare me at all
I've got my armour on
Damn right I'm ready for battle
I know it's dangerous right now I'm strong enough
I'm pushing through to you
Baby I'm on my way and I'll fight for you

I'll do what I gotta do yeah I'll fight for you, I'll fight for you
I'd risk my life dying on the frontline for you, I'll fight for you
For your love, I'd fight for your heart
Go to war to be next to you
And no I won't stop till you're mine boy
I'll fight for you, I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you

Go ahead and mark this date in history
'Cause it's the battle of the century
There's never gonna be another soldier for love
That'll fight for you like me

I'll fight in the south
I'll fight in the north
I'm gonna fight for you like I've never fought before
I'll fight in the west
