I owe you $20 baby you were right
I guess I should have thought it through before
I swear that all I've done since I got off the flight,
Is missed you much and then missed you some more
Unpacked my bags, put on some tunes
But all it did was make me think of you
Now I'm a wreck, I miss my boo
Being away from you is just not cool

I love what you do to me baby
The touch of you makes me go crazy
I figure there's only one thing to do
I've gotta get back to you

I need you to whisper in my ear
And tell me the things that I want to hear
The moment that I got here boy I knew
I've gotta get back to you

Rush rush now boy, running on back to you (running on back to you)
Rush rush now boy

Can't wait until your arms are wrapped around me tight
All night, every night
We'll watch the stars turn into the morning light
Right there side by side
The things you say, the little things you do
Make me go, make me go ooh ooh
I need you close, I'll be home soon
And when I get back I'm gonna stick like glue

I love what you do to me baby
The touch of you makes me go crazy
I figure there's only one thing to do
I've gotta get back to you

I need you to whisper in my ear
And tell me the things that I want to hear
The moment that I got here boy I knew
I've gotta get back to you

I've gotta get back to where I never feel alone
Back to the best and only love I've ever known
To the familiar face, that smile
You make me laugh until I cry
There I belong (I belong)
'Cause you're my heart

(I'm running on back to you)

I love what you do to me baby
The touch of you makes me go crazy
I figure there's only one thing to do
I've gotta get back to you

I need you to whisper in my ear
And tell me the things that I want to hear
The moment that I got here boy I knew
I've gotta get back to you

Rush rush now boy, running on back to you (running on back to you)
Rush rush now boy
Rush rush now boy, running on back to you (running on back to you)
Rush rush now boy
