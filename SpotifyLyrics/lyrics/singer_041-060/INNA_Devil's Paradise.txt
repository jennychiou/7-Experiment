No I don't know
Know where you came
You came from bad
If you like

You can be my
Inspiration
In the day time
Or at night

'Cause baby
You shine like platinum ring
And if you want mine
I will show you off

And if you like to be held
I can hold you
Till the end of time

'Cause you are
The thing I need to do
Now I'm craving you
'Cause you make
All my wrongs feel right
Like a devil's paradise

You
I'm a little scared of you
Yeah, I want you now
'Cause your lips
Are the perfect crime
Like a devil's paradise

You take all my flaws
And make them
Priceless diamonds
I bet you're

You're an angel
Undercover
And I like it
Yeah, I'm sure

'Cause baby
You shine like platinum ring
And if you want mine
I will show you off

And if you like to be held
I can hold you
Till the end of time

'Cause you are
The thing I need to do
Now I'm craving you
'Cause you make
All my wrongs feel right
Like a devil's paradise

You
I'm a little scared of you
Yeah, I want you now
'Cause your lips
Are the perfect crime
Like a devil's paradise
