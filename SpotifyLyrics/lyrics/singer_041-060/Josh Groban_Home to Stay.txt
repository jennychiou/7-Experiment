I know you're gone 
I watched you leave 
I always thought 
That it was me 
You made it clear 
With that last kiss 
You couldn't live a life 
With maybe's and whatif's 

When every boat 
Has sailed away 
And every path 
Is marked and paved 
When every road 
Has had its say 
Then I'll be bringing you back 
Home to stay 

I have the cards you sent to me 
You wrote of trains and Paris galleries 
This spring you'll draw 
Canals, and frescoed walls 
Look how far your dreaming's gone 

When every town looks just the same 
When every choice gets hard to make 
When every map is put away 
Then I'll be bringing you back 
Home to stay 

And now I know why you had to go alone 
Isn't there a place between 

When every boat 
Has sailed away 
And every path 
Is marked and paved 

When every road 
Has had its say 
Then I'll be bringing you back 
Home to stay 

Reach out to me 
Call out my name 
And I would bring you back again 
Today
