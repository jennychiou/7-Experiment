Your lips are moving
But I don't hear a thing
Your body calling
Calling biology
I'm on a mission
So breathe it all on me
Breathe it all on me baby

And I'm good at conversations
But I'm down with easy words
Let's give it a temptation
'Cause I got you (?)
Yeah

Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth you can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
You want it
I want it

I'm sick of distance
Remove the space between
It's human nature
It's only natural
So let me take her
Somewhere you've never been

And I'm good at conversations
But I'm down with easy words
Let's give it a temptation
'Cause I got you (?)

Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth you can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
You want it
I want it
You want it
I want it
You want it

You can bring me back back, back, back
You can bring me back back, back, back
You can bring me back back, back, back
You can bring me back back, back, back

Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth you can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
You want it
(Mouth to mouth I can give you)

Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth you can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth I can give you mouth to mouth
You want it
I want it
(Bring me back, oh)
You want it
I want it (oh)
You want it
I want it
