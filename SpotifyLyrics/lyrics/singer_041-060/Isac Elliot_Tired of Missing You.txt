I'll write you a song with simple words
I'll write you a song with chords you've heard
I'll write you a simple melody
With hopes you'll understand it and come back to me

I'll think of you time and again
But I'll lie to you because it's everyday my friend
And I'll wholeheartedly wish you well
You need it more than me oh boy - can't you tell?

I'll sing it to you until you know
That my life is only going... so so
'Cause I'm tired I'm tired I'm tired of missing you
I'm tired I'm so tired of missing you
I'll let my single life set me free and overcharge my credit card
It's good for me
And I'll eat your heart in chocolate bar
And hope that you are fat at our next encounter

To you I'm so put together
I've moved on from you
I'll look back never
Open your eyes and see I've been
Waiting here for you to
Come back to me
Woah

And I know this doesn't sound like me
But how would you know you left me so prematurely
And I'll feel better I know some day soon
And remember you as a good guy once I've met someone new
I'll sing it to you until you know
That my life is only going... so so
'Cause I'm tired I'm tired I'm tired of missing you
I'm tired I'm so tired of missing you
