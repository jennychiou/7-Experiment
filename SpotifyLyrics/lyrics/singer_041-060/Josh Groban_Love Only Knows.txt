I've tried to hold this back so long
And we're always such a good thing when its gone
Would it be all right if we just left our heads tonight

Take me away from this old game
Of saying we're both too much the same
Would it be all right if I just stayed with you tonight
And before I go, will I ever see you again

She said love only knows
Love only knows if we'll give into fear and choose life undercover
She said love only knows if its special enough that we'll choose one another
Choose each other

You were the secret I loved keep
The name I would only sing in my sleep
Would it be all right if we just lose ourselves tonight
And if you let go, will you reach out again

She said love only knows
Love only knows if we'll give into fear and choose life undercover
She said love only knows its special enough that we'll choose one another
We'll choose each other
And I can't breath without you and I don't, and I can't live without love and I won't... and I won't

Love only knows if we'll give into fear and choose life undercover
She said love only knows if its special enough that we'll choose one another
Oh, love only knows how your arms pull me in like the tide pulls me under
She said love only knows just how long we can run before we lose each other

And we need each other
And I can't live without you and I won't
