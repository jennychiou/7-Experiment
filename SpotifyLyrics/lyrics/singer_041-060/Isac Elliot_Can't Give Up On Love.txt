Heart, soul... Shine like silver and gold
Girl you've got it all... Yes you make me shiver
Me, you, I can't believe it's true
Wish that we could make this last forever

I've got this feeling
And you know it's so hard to explain
You wind me up
And I can't seem to come back down again
It's getting serious

We have to keep it tight
No matter how I try
Things are building up inside
I want to get it right
That's why I, why I

One heart is the lonely one
Two and we'll do better together
Three: I've got a crush on you
Four: I wish we could get much closer
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I lose control
One step further I know that I just

Heart, soul... Shine like silver and gold
Girl you've got it all... Yes you make me shiver
Me, you, I can't believe it's true
Wish that we could make this last forever

With every kiss my strength
And power gets a little weaker

I can't stop thinking 'bout this baby'
You and me
That's why I, why I

One heart is the lonely one
Two and we'll do better together
Three: I've got a crush on you
Four: I wish we could get much closer
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I lose control
One step further I know that I just

Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah, I gotta go
