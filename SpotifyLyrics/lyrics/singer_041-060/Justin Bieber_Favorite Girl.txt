I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest
The star of my show
So many times I wished
You'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this
Girl what you do to me

You're who I'm thinking of
Girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what you're always number one

My prize possession
One and only
Adore ya girl I want ya
The one I can't live without
That's you (that's you)
That's you (that's you)
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl

You're used to going out your way
To impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
Is a dream that can't be real
So girl let's write a fairytale
And show 'em how we feel

You're who I'm thinking of (of)
Girl you ain't my runner up (up)
And no matter what you're always number one

My prize possession
One and only
Adore ya girl I want ya
The one I can`t live without
That's you (that's you)
That's you (that's you)

Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite

My favorite girl
Baby it's you
My favorite, my favorite

You take my breath away
With everything you say

Promise to play no games
Treat you no other way
Than you deserve 'cause you're the girl of my dreams
