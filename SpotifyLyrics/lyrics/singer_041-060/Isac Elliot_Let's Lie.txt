Let's lie, yeah
Lie, yeah, girl

I wanna take you to a place that I've found
It's a place that no one else knows about
You can see the clear night sky
Girl if you come with me tonight
And if you ever see a shooting star
You can wish for anything you want

But you can't tell anyone
'Cause if your parents say no
There's only one thing we can do

And tell 'em that we're gonna sleep
Sneak out the windows, meet down the street
We can run away
Then we'll stay up late
Watch the starry sky
So let's lie
'Cause we're never gonna go to sleep

I wanna take you by the hand as we go
And hold you in my arms when we're alone (we're alone)
We can watch the clear night sky
Just hang and let the hours fly
And if it gets cold and dark
Then I'll keep you warm by my side

But you can't tell anyone
'Cause if your parents say no
There's only one thing we can do

And tell 'em that we're gonna sleep
Sneak out the windows, meet down the street
We can run away
Then we'll stay up late
Watch the starry sky
So let's lie
'Cause we're never gonna go to sleep

Baby, if you come with me I'll be as happy as can be
And if we fall asleep this will be the best dream

And tell 'em that we're gonna sleep
Sneak out the windows, meet down the street
We can run away
Then we'll stay up late
Watch the starry sky
So let's lie
'Cause we're never gonna go to sleep
