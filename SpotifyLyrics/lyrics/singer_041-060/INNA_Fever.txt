Look in the mirror
You, I'm a hero
You give me fever
Fever

Slowly with passion
Boy have attraction
Nobody's trying to stop me

Look in the mirror
You, I'm a hero
You give me fever
Fever

Slowly with passion
Boy have attraction
Nobody's trying to stop me

But I can fall
I can fall
You're the reason
That I'm crying
And I dream
I can dream
That I'm with you

Look in the mirror
You, I'm a hero
You give me fever
Fever

Slowly with passion
Boy have attraction
Nobody's trying to stop me

Look in the mirror
You, I'm a hero
You give me fever
Fever

Slowly with passion
Boy have attraction
Nobody's trying to stop me

But I can fall
I can fall
You're the reason
That I'm crying
And I dream
I can dream
That I'm with you
