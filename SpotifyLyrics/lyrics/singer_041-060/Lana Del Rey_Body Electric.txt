[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] is my daddy,
[[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]]'s my mother,
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We don't need nobody,
'Cause we got each other,
Or at least I pretend.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling all right,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.

(I said don't worry 'bout it).

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
I'm on fire, sing that body electric.

Whitman is my daddy,
Monaco's my mother,
Diamonds are my bestest friend.
Heaven is my baby,
Suicide's her father,
Opulence is the end.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling all right,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.

(I said don't worry 'bout it).

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
I'm on fire, sing that body electric.

My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say that you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt and go about the world like I'm
Having fun
We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
Feeling all right
Mary swaying softly to her hearts delight.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
I'm on fire, sing that body electric.

I sing the body electric, baby,
I sing the body electric, baby,
I sing the body electric, baby.
