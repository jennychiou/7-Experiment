Ah ah ah ah
Caught somewhere
Between a nightmare and a dream
Not sure who's game it is
Or what it all even means
Not sure who to be
Do you want the good or bad in me

Not sure what you expect to find
But I'm certain I can change
Your mind
You ask what kind of girl am I
Well, do you want the good or
The bad kind
You know I'd stay

Every morning every evening
Boy I'd stay
Just as long as you can please me
Boy I'd stay

Wrap myself around your body
Can't let go
Ouu you make it hot hot baby
Come on
I can be as sweet as a summers day
Fulfill your fantasies once I
Whisper your name

Here you come running one
More time
Mister, do you want the good
Or bad kind
You know I'd stay
Every morning every evening
Boy I'd stay

Just as long as you can please me
Boy I'd stay
Wrap myself around your body

Can't let go
Ouu you make it hot hot baby
Come on

You know I'd stay
Every morning every evening
Boy I'd stay
Just as long as you can please me
Boy I'd stay
Wrap myself around your body
Can't let go
Ouu you make it hot hot baby
Come on
Ouu you make it hot hot baby come on 3x
Stay, wrap myself around your body
Can't let go
You make it hot hot baby come on
Stay every morning every
Evening
Boy I'd stay
Just as long as you can please me
Boy I'd stay
Wrap myself around your body
Can't let go
Ouu you make it hot hot baby
Come on
Stay every morning every
Evening
Boy I'd stay
Just as long as you can please me
Boy I'd stay
Wrap myself around your body
Can't let go
Ouu you make it hot hot baby
Come on
