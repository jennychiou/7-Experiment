Oh we need to be reconnected
Oh we need to be reconnected, reconnected

I'm not ready for it to be over yet
No, don't wanna pull the plug out
But my heart don't wanna repay the debt, no
I know it's gonna cost me if I keep this thing going
There's a bug in the system
Don't think that it can be fixed at all
I need it, call in my life line, I need it but it keeps cutting in and out
Our circuit's shortin' now, the system's overloaded
We're losing it, we need a power surge
What we use to have was electric, what we use to have was electric

What happened to the spark, somebody pulled the plug
That connected our hearts
I'm tryin' to get that love back
Call in an electrician tell them that we need an
Urgent reconnection, tell that we need an urgent reconnection
Tell them that we need an urgent reconnection
We need an urgent reconnect, we need to reconnect
We need to be reconnected, yeah oh
We need to be reconnected, reconnected

I'm not ready for it to be over yet
No, no I didn't want it
But it was inevitable that we disconnected, disconnected
No communication, our lines crossed and the signals faded
But that's how we made it, is it worth the repair how can we patch it up
Maybe we'll shut it down and see it that'll work
Our circuit's shortin' now, the system's overloaded
We're losing it, we need a power surge
What we use to have was electric, what we use to have was electric

Oh what happened to the spark, somebody pulled the plug
That connected our hearts
I'm tryin' to get that love back
Call in an electrician tell them that we need an
Urgent reconnection, tell that we need an urgent reconnection
Tell them that we need an urgent reconnection
We need an urgent reconnect, we need to reconnect
We need to be reconnected, yeah oh
We need to be reconnected, reconnected

Oh what happened to the spark, somebody pulled the plug
That connected our hearts
I'm tryin' to get that love back
Call in an electrician tell them that we need an
Urgent reconnection, tell that we need an urgent reconnection
Tell them that we need an urgent reconnection
We need an urgent reconnect, we need to reconnect
