When the days seem darker
And the nights more cold
All the fear is broken
When there's you to hold

Never doubt or question
What I feel for you
You will not be certain
I will follow through

Take me there
Take me there with you
I don't know where
But I'll follow too

So take me there
Take me there with you
With the road wide open
And the daybreak near
I could never fathom
Life without you here

Take me there
Take me there with you.
I don't know where
But I'll follow too

So take me there
Take me there with you
I will see you through

Everything you do
Take me there
Take me there with you
