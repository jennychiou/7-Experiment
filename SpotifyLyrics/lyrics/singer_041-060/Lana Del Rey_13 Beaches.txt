I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With dripping peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying (yeah)
For something real
That I've been dying for something real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines with the daisies
Feeling hazy in the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying (yeah)
For something real
That I've been dying for something real
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal
