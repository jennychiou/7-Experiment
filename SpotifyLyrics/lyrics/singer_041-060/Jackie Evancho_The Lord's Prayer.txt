Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth
As it is in heaven

Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive our debts
As we forgive our debtors
Lead us not into temptation
And deliver us from evil.

For Thine is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory forever.

For Thine is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory forever.

Amen
