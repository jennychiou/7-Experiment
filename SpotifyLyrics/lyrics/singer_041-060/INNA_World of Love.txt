Only got my life, one time
One ticket, one step, one love
Wanna live it up large so don't stop
Come on everybody, come move your body and turn it way up loud

Oh yeah...
Oh oh oh...
Yeah...
Oh oh oh...

It's a world of love oh oh oh oh
Where all my friends make me feel so good
So here go oh oh oh oh oh
So throw your hands in the air just like you should

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
No sitting down, rock the rhythm, dance all night

Send your hands up high in the sky
My crowd, the room goes wild
Hands up in the air like you just don't care
Come on everybody, come move your body and turn it way up loud

Oh yeah...
