Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
I've been good, but I can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
And I want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late

Want a plane that loops the loop
And I still want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
