"'Justin Bieber"'
This is the time of year
We can give it, give it, give it, give it all
1 thru 10 on your list
You can get it, get it, get it, get it all
Make your wish tonight
When you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl
I'll be right there

"'Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber"'
Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night oooh
When I put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me
(like fa la la, la, fa la la)
That's how I know that it's Christmas time

"'Boyz II Men"'
You got on my favorite dress
And you're lookin, lookin, lookin good oh
Snow fallin on your hair
And I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift

"'Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber"'
Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, oooh
When I put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me
(like fa la la, la, fa la la)
That's how I know that it's Christmas time

"'Justin Bieber and Boyz II Men"'
I'm gonna deck your heart with boughs of holly (boughs of holly)
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Baby 'cause you're the reason to be jolly
Fa la la, la la la, la la la

"'Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber"'
I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me
(like fa la la, la, fa la la)
That's how I know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Christmas
That's how I know it's Christmas time
Fa la la, la, fa la la
That's how I know it's Christmas time
