I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make a nighttime all the day
So it'd suit the mood of your soul
Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty
Black beauty

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather, too
You have no room for light, love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling you can't let everything seem so dark blue
Oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through you?

Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty
Black beauty
Black beauty
Black beauty
Black beauty
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby

Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty
Black beauty
Black beauty
Black beauty
