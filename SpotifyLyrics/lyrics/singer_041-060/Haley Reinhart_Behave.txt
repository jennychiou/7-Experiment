I like you 'cause you're in your
Own little world
I like you 'cause you tell me I'm
Your pearl
Sometimes I scream out at night
Wanting more of your love
Funny how time flies
When I just can't enough
How deep can you go
'Cause I just can't get enough of
Your funnin'
Kisses for breakfast
Then lunch
That's when you take it down-

Town
Dressed up a dinner for two
Take it off for desert now
Champaign and roses it's true
You sure make me want to
Come home and cling onto you
Ouu I'm falling falling

How deep can you go, 'Cause I just can't get enough of your funnin' 2x

Hey

I can't get enough 4x
A guy like you

Could make me forget the rest
Of 'em
You put it down
Better than the best of 'em
A guy like you is all I need to
Keep me happy
You lay it down
Ya have me begging more please
Please please
A guy like you
Could make me forget the rest
Of 'em
You put it down
Better than the best of 'em
A guy like you is all I need to
Keep me happy
You lay it down
Ya have me begging more please
Please please
Waking up in a daze
I come to find
You're not here
You never were
It figures
Why can't I find a guy like you
A guy like you 6x
