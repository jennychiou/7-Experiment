You are so hard to read like a foreign novel
I don't know if I'll ever figure you out
So many pieces of ya like a jigsaw puzzle
My head is spinnin' around

Yeah, 'cause one minute you want my touch
Next minute you don't want none
Honestly don't know which way to go
This love is out of control
Should I stay or should I go?
I don't know 'cause
Sometimes you treat me so special sometimes you don't
Sometimes you give me your best sometimes you're cold
Your heart is like a maze
Your heart is like a maze
Your heart is like a maze
Everyday I keep losing my way

You make me insecure like I'm goin' crazy
But it can't be my fault 'cause I'm trying hard
It's you who won't commit everything is maybe
Leaving me out in the dark

Yeah, 'cause one minute you want my touch
Next minute you don't want none
Honestly don't know which way to go
This love is out of control
Should I stay or should I go?
I don't know 'cause
Sometimes you treat me so special sometimes you don't
Sometimes you give me your best sometimes you're cold
Your heart is like a maze
Your heart is like a maze
Your heart is like a maze
Everyday I keep losing my way

So confused, so lost
Everywhere I turn seems to be wrong
I need your help let me know
Give me a sign and let me know that there's hope

Yeah, 'cause one minute you want my touch
Next minute you don't want none
Honestly don't know which way to go
This love is out of control
Should I stay or should I go?
I don't know 'cause
Sometimes you treat me so special sometimes you don't
Sometimes you give me your best sometimes you're cold
Your heart is like a maze
Your heart is like a maze
Your heart is like a maze
Everyday I keep losing my way
