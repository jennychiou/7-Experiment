Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron

He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes"

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah baby bow down making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar how now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss
I sing the national anthem while I'm standin' over your body,
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me
King of chevron

He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Umm, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah baby bow down making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar how now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage

Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe, in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation

Boy, you have landed
Babe in the land of
Sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah baby bow down making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar how now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem, of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem, of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem, of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem, of success
