Stars, they got nothing on us
I don't think you understand

Let's go out and do something we'd never do
'Cause I feel like I can do anything when
My head is spinning and my feet off the ground
When I can't stop dancing like no one's around
And yeah, I think we were born to shine

'Cause the stars are dull when they're compared to you and I
And if people don't like it then they can close their eyes
'Cause we're not the same and we don't have to try
'Cause we're brighter than fireflies, we're gonna light the sky

Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh oh

Light the sky
You and me, me and you
'Cause we are not afraid to let our light out
So trust in me and just have no doubt
'Cause we will be tearing through the clouds

'Cause my head is spinning
And my feet off the ground
And I can't stop dancing
Like no one's around
And yeah I think we were born to shine

'Cause the stars are dull when they're compared to you and I
And if people don't like it then they can close their eyes
'Cause we're not the same and we don't have to try
'Cause we're brighter than fireflies, we're gonna light the sky

Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh oh
Light the sky

You and me, me and you
We will shine through
You and me, me and you
We will shine

'Cause my head is spinning
And my feet off the ground
And I can't stop dancing
Like no one's around
And yeah I think we were born to shine

'Cause the stars are dull when they're compared to you and I
And if people don't like it then they can close their eyes
'Cause we're not the same and we don't have to try
'Cause we're brighter than fireflies, we're gonna light the sky

Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh oh
Light the sky
