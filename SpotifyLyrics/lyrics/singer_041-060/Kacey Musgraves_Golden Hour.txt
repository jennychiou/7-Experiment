All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

Baby don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright, mhm

I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
It's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

Baby don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire, yeah, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, yeah

You make the world look beautiful, ooh
Thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

You're my golden hour
A watercolor sky
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

Yeah I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour
