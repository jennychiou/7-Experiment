Everybody falls in love
And then falls down
And I'm feeling so high
I'm feeling so high
For you

Everybody falls in love
And then falls down
And I'm feeling so high
I'm feeling for you
Boy, I'm feeling for you

Don't let the music die
Don't have to feel alone
You have to learn to say
We'll be okay tomorrow

Don't let the music die
Don't have to feel alone
I've got love
And many reasons to love
Reasons to love

Every step that I take
Brings you closer
In my dream
In my dream, in my dream

Every step that I take
Brings you closer
In my dream
In my dream, in my dream

Every step that I take
Brings you closer
In my dream
In my dream, in my dream

Every step that I take
Brings you closer
In my dream
In my dream, in my dream

Don't let the music die
Don't have to feel alone
You have to learn to say
We'll be okay tomorrow

Don't let the music die
Don't have to feel alone
I've got love
And many reasons to love
Reasons to love
