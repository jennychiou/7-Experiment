Your eyes
They speak to me
But I don't know what they are saying
But I think I know what you are thinking

Just close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through your hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life

You found a lighter
On the street
And suddenly everything just might seems so happy
My honey that's all temporary

Just close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through you hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life

Just close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let to wind blow through you hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life

A better life
Maybe this time
Things will turn out right
