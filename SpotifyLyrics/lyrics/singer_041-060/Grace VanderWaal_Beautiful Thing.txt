You think that you know my heart
And you probably do, so I'm always with you
I could stay with you for hours in an empty room
And never get bored, never have nothing to do

You're my other half, you're what makes me me
What makes me smile when I fall down
And can't get back, get back, get back up on my feet

Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself, makes me funny
You're a beautiful thing

We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
We find the rainbow, up in the sky
You'd say don't you cry, it's all gonna be alright

If we ever gone through a fight oh that would be bad
'Cause you know all of my secrets
But I know all of yours

We make hours turn into seconds together
The weight of the world feel like a feather
'Cause we're holding it right in our hands

You're my other half, you're what makes me me
What makes me smile when I fall down
And can't get back up, get back, get back up on my feet

Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself, makes me funny
You're a beautiful thing

We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

You and me
Together, we'll forget what we have been told
We'll live in our own dream world
You and me, forever
We'll forget what we have been told
We will take on the whole world

Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself, it makes me funny
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

And that's a beautiful thing
