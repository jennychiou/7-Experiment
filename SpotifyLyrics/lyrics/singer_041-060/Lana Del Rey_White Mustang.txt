Packing all my things for the summer
Lying on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feeling
The day your record dropped

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

Caught up in my dreams and forgetting
I've been acting like armageddon
'Cause you held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for loving and leaving
I was such a fool for believing that you
Could change all the ways you've been living
But you just couldn't stop

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

You're revving and revving and revving it up
And the sound, it was frightening
And you were getting a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightning

White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild mustang

You're gonna hit me like lightning
You're gonna hit me like lightning
