Look at you kids with your vintage music
Coming through satellites while cruising
You're part of the past but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

It's enough just to make you feel crazy crazy crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love
To be young and in love

Look at you kids you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy crazy crazy
I know it's enough just to make you go crazy crazy crazy

But you get ready you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or [go] the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love
To be young and in love

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy crazy crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy crazy crazy

I get ready I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love
I'm young and in love

Don't worry, baby
Don't worry, baby
