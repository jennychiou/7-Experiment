Are you, are you, are you gonna be my girl

You're standing there looking cooler than ice
Can't help but stare
You were born to be in the spotlight
You act so tough, hanging with your crew
Them girls will step aside
Now that I'm walking over to you

Oh, pull on my jacket, yo they check me out
You're lighting up my socket
I'm on my fire don't put me out
Oh, people keep blocking
But I've locked on to your eyes
There's just one question that is going round
And round my mind

Are you my type
'Cause I'm waiting for you baby
I've been looking all night
Are you my type
'Cause I think that you're amazing
It feels like the right time

Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Gonna' be my girl

Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Gonna' be my girl

If you're my girl I can give you the world
"Oh you want a diamond ring"
I'll buy the crown jewels to be your king
I catch your eye with one cheeky glance
I wink you blink, let me tell you baby what I think

I am a gnarly dude for my cool girl
I want my name on her lips, she's a fly girl, check it
Pretty, witty, she's a little fitty
I'll shout it out what she does to me
So delectable, so respectable
She's original, simply magical
Oh, never ever let her go
She's my girl so unforgettable

Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Gonna' be my girl

Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Gonna' be my girl

Oh, you're one in a million
Say my name, say my name baby
I'm dying just to take you out, are you gonna be my girl

Come on girl I know you what you thinking
Ha, let's do this, let's do this on 1, 2, 3, 4

Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Gonna' be my girl

Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Gonna' be my girl

Are you gonna be my girlfriend tonight
My girl tonight...

Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Gonna' be my girl
