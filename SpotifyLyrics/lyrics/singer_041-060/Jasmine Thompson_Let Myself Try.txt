I'm gonna find and I'm not coming back
And all the white lies that I don't understand
All of these walls, well they're starting to fall
I'm gonna try and I'm not gonna stop
I'll give all I have and I'll take what I've got
And if all of my dreams fall apart at the seams

It's alright cause in time, I'll be fine
I'm gonna let myself, let myself
Fall once or twice, I won't mind
I'm gonna let myself, let myself
Fail and discover, cause one way or another
I'll be fine, it's alright in this life
I'm gonna let myself, let myself

If I'm gonna love, maybe I'm gonna lose
If I'm gonna touch, maybe I'm gonna bruise
Cause all of these scars, they know that we are

It's alright cause in time, I'll be fine
I'm gonna let myself, let myself
Fall once or twice, I won't mind
I'm gonna let myself, let myself
Fail and discover, cause one way or another
I'll be fine, it's alright in this life
I'm gonna let myself, let myself

And who says perfect can't be little things, little things
I look at you and I see simplicity in front of me
And that's everything

It's alright cause in time, I'll be fine
I'm gonna let myself, let myself
Fall once or twice, I won't mind
I'm gonna let myself, let myself
Fail and discover, cause one way or another
I'll be fine, it's alright in this life
I'm gonna let myself, let myself
