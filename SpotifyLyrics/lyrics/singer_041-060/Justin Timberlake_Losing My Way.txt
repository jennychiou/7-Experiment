Yeah um, excuse me

Hi, my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make forty-something dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way

It all goes back to when I dropped out of school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See I can't put down the pipe

And it is breaking me down
Watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

It is breaking me down
No more friends around
And my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself

There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself

Losing my way, oh, keep losing my way, oh
Keep losing my way, can you help me find my way?
Losing my way, oh, keep losing my way, oh
Keep losing my way, can you help me find my way?

Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I would have done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone

I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is I probably never know
The color of my daughter's eyes

And it is breaking me down
Watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

It is breaking me down
No more friends around
And my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself

There's gotta be a heaven somewhere (There's gotta be a heaven somewhere)
Can you save me from this hell? (Can you save me?)
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself

Losing my way (yeah), keep losing my way (losing my way)
Keep losing my way (keep losing my way), can you help me find my way? (Oh yeah, yeah)
Losing my way (losing my way), keep losing my way (keep losing my way)
Keep losing my way, so can you help me find my way?

Oh, my God, please forgive me (Father, hear my prayer)
'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life (in this life)
If I could do it all again (do it all again), have just one more chance
To take all those wrongs and make them right, oh

Can anybody out there hear me? (Oh)
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself (Hey)
Can anybody out there see me? (Anybody out there see me?)
'Cause I can't seem to see myself

There's gotta be a heaven somewhere (There's gotta be a heaven somewhere)
Can you save me from this hell? (Hey)
Can anybody out there feel me? (Feel me)
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself (Feel me, hey)

Can anybody out there hear me? (Can anybody out there hear me?)
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself (I can't hear myself)
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself (I can't seem to see myself)

There's gotta be a heaven somewhere (There's gotta be a heaven somewhere)
Can you save me from this hell? (Can you save me from this hell?)
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself

Losing my way, keep losing my way (keep losing my way)
Keep losing my way (keep losing my way), can you help me find my way? (No, no, hear my cry)
Losing my way (losing my way), keep losing my way (keep losing my way)
Keep losing my way (please), so can you help me find my way?
