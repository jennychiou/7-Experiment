Hold tight
Mama used to say
It's alright
No need to be afraid
Confusion
Is the damnedest thing
One day your flying
The next you've lost your wings
But I'm getting tired of all this
Fronting
Feels like I'm running on empty
For nothing
Now I'm telling you
I can't take no more
'Cause I feel the weight
Of the world on me
Tell me the truth
That it's not in vain
Broken promises
They can be saved
To this day
I believe
There's no shame
'Cause love is worth fighting for
When it takes you
It's the grandest thing
It'll make you
It can break you just the same
But I'm getting tired of all this
Fronting
Feels like I'm running on empty
For nothing
Now I'm telling you
I can't take no more
'Cause I feel the weight
Of the world on me
Tell me the truth
That it's not in vein
Broken promises
They can be saved
To this day
I believe
There's no shame
'Cause love is worth
Love is worth
Love is worth fighting for
Tell me now
Won't you tell me now
Won't you tell me now
Can you tell me now
Won't you tell me now
Is it worth fighting for
Well I'm telling you
I can't take no more
'Cause I feel the weight
Of the world on me
Tell me the truth
That it's not in vein
Broken promises
They can be saved
To this day
I believe
There's no shame
'Cause love is worth
Love is worth
Love is worth fighting for
I said love is worth, Love is worth, Love is worth fighting for 3x
