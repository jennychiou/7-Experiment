I know you're thinking that I'm right here
Where you left me
Patiently waiting for your call
Never imagine that I'll ever tell you no
'Cause it's never happened before

If you'd thought higher of yourself
You'll be up in the clouds
But here let me help you down
So, don't tell me that you
Wanna start working it out
When it's too late to question now

What about me?
What about what I want?
Wanna know what I think?
No, I didn't think so
I, I feel like I played the fool
In assuming that life
Ain't all about you

You think I'm crazy
For not wanting you no more
But how can you blame me? Blame
When you're, you're, you're you're
So self righteous?
In a perfume of politeness?
Yes, your highness

If you'd thought higher of yourself
You'll be up in the clouds
But here let me help you down
So, don't tell me that you
Wanna start working it out
When it's too late to question now

What about me?
What about what I want?
Wanna know what I think?
No, I didn't think so
I, I, I feel like I played the fool
In assuming that life
Ain't all about you

Oh oh, 'cause it's all about you
Yeah, it's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
It's all about you, uuh

It's all about you
It's all about you, uuh
It's all about you
It's all about you, uuh
It's all about you
It's all about you, uuh

What about me?
What about what I want?
Wanna know what I think?
No, I didn't think so

I, I, I feel like I played the fool
In assuming that life
Ain't all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you, uuh

It's all about you
It's all about you, uuh
It's all about you
It's all about you, uuh
It's all about you
All about you
