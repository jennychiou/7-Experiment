I swear I don't belong here
But I believe
Don't tell me this all comes from fear
I promise I'll be different
There's nothing left
I'm on my knees surrendering
This can't be

I didn't know I lost it all
Didn't know I'd break and fall
This isn't who I'm meant to be
There's so much here that I found missing

Lost it all
You can hear the angels call
This isn't who you're meant to be
I lost it all now I'm found missing

I look in my reflection
A stranger now
I bury vows and redemption
And if you can't see the pain in
My father's eyes as he told me goodbye honey, don't be afraid I'll be here waiting at the end of your time
I will learn to walk again, again

I didn't know I lost it all
Didn't know I'd break and fall
This isn't who I'm meant to be
There's so much here that I found missing

Lost it all
You can hear the angels call
This isn't who you're meant to be
I lost it all now I'm found missing

Like a bomb in the night
I woke up to different life
I'm at war with my head, open my eyes
Let the dust settle in

I was just too afraid
Doing my best was never enough to really win
I was told that this curse only gets worse
If you never hurt or ask God, for forgiveness
For forgiveness

Yeah, yeah

I didn't know I lost it all
Didn't know I'd break and fall
This isn't who I'm meant to be
There's so much here that I found missing

Lost it all
You can hear the angels call
This isn't who you're meant to be
I lost it all now I'm found missing.
