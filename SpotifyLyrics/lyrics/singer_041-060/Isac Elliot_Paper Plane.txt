So many days since I saw your face
God knows how many times
I've been tryin' not to call you
You've been around the world, up to the moon
Always on the run, so young and restless

She was long gone when she was close to me
Oh, I just had to let her go for now, just let her leave

Now the road is long and she's far away
Don't have a boat, no I can't co by train
Ooh, baby, I'm coming anyway

I'll build a paper plane so I can fly
Over the skyline
I know it sounds insane
But I will try
Cause wherever u r
Where ever you are
Where ever ever I'll risk it for ya'

How d'ya feel?
Tell me where do you stand
Where do you call home
Girl I need to know

'Cause in my heart there is a hole
That only you can fill
So I'm coming for ya'

She was long gone when she was close to me
Oh, I just had to let her go for now, just let her leave

Now the road is long and she's far away
Don't have a boat, no I can't co by train
Ooh, baby, I'm coming anyway

I'll build a paper plane so I can fly
Over the skyline
I know it sounds insane
But I will try
Cause wherever u r
Where ever you are
Where ever ever I'll risk it for ya'

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I know I'll find ya'
My heart belongs to ya'
Then this won't hurt no more
No this won't hurt no more
