You might think things are sweet
But I'm here to tell you something
Not everything is peachy keen
I need more than what you're offering

Man, you're lucky your lovin' is something to keep you around
But don't get excited there's more on my mind than you now

I'll have my cake and eat it too
I'll have my cake and eat it too
Long as you keep your lovin' good
Don't worry 'bout me leaving you

Some are saints and others judge
And say what they shouldn't
I ain't no angel, but I speak the truth
Wouldn't be me if I couldn't

Man, you're lucky your lovin' is something to keep you around
But don't get excited there's more on my mind than you now

I'll have my cake and eat it too
I'll have my cake and eat it too
Long as you keep your lovin' good
Don't worry 'bout me leaving you

Oh, I want it
Oh, that's what I want

I'll have my cake and eat it too
I'll have my cake and eat it too
Long as you keep your lovin' good
Don't worry 'bout me leaving you
I'll have my cake and eat it too
