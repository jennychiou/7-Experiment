Twisted like a turnakette tighter tied around my neck
It's not just what you do it's a lack of respect
My friends are callin' me everyone's tellin' me
What you've been doing who you've been screwing

Here's that last chance you get your failing every test
I can see right through you, you just don't know it yet
But you won't let me live you want to strangle me
Take everything that's good I want you back

Your twisted
As a liar your gifted
Can't believe you're so twisted
Like an actor in character
I don't know how I missed it
No matter what you do no matter what you say
I can see it more everyday, everyday
But I won't take it I won't be jaded
You think I can't resist and that's because
Your twisted

You cross your heart and say baby it's not that way
I don't need to see your phone I can see your face
Not losing any sleep the secrets that you keep
You enjoy yourself and I know why

Your twisted
As a liar your gifted
Can't believe you're so twisted
Like an actor in character
I don't know how I missed it
No matter what you do no matter what you say
I can see it more everyday, everyday

But I won't take it I won't be jaded
You think I can't resist and that's because

You can not be trusted
It is just a waste of time
Let the hours tick tock
You won't get no more of mine
And yes its clear to me
I see you'll always be twisted
From the neck up get a checkup
Please don't tie
I'm gettin' off of this ride

Your twisted
As a liar your gifted
Can't believe you're so twisted
Like an actor in character
I don't know how I missed it
No matter what you do no matter what you say
I can see it more every day, every day
But I won't take it I won't be jaded
You think I can't resist and that's because
Your twisted
Your twisted
No matter what you do no matter what you say
I can see it more every day, every day
But I won't take it I won't be jaded
You think I can't resist and that's because
Your twisted
