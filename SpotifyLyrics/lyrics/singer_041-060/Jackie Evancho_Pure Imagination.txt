Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination

We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy
Explanation

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world, there's nothing to it

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

If you want to see magic lines
Close your eyes and you will see one
Wanna be a dream, I'll be one
Anytime you please
And please leave me one

Come with me
And you'll be
In a world of
Pure imagination
Take a look
And you'll see
Into your imagination

There is no
Life I know
To compare with
Pure imagination
Living there
You'll be free
If you truly
Wish to be

Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be
