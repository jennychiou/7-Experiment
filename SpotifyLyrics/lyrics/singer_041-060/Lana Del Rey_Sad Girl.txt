Being a mistress on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
We've been around on the side
Wanna be something you would do

But you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him

He's got the fire and he walks with fame
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me so sad, girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl

Being a bad bitch on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
We've been around when he gets high
It might not be something you would do

But you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him

He's got the fire and he walks with fame
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me so sad, girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl

Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
I'm on fire, baby
I'm on fire

He's got the fire and he walks with fame
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me so sad, girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
