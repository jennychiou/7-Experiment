He's a one way ticket
Hate to tell you you'll be traveling alone
There's only one thing missing
And that's a heart that never was yours

Don't try to stop just keep on moving gotta go
No need to tell me how you feel
I got some things to do that don't include you
Don't believe me I'm for real

Cuz I won't waste all of my time
Hoping you gon get me right
And I got one thing on my mind
And you need to know it isn't you
So you can go, that's ok
I had a party I'll keep the boys up late
We gonna party trust me I'm ok
I'll have a heartbreak party
I won't be missing you

It's like you just ain't in it
So what's the point in me giving my all
I really feel like livin'
Not sitting 'round waiting for you to call

Don't try to stop just keep on moving gotta go
No need to tell me how you feel
I got some things to do that don't include you
Don't believe me I'm for real

Cuz I won't waste all of my time
Hoping you gon get it right
And I got one thing on my mind
And you need to know it isn't you
So you can go that's ok
I had a party I'll keep the boys up late
We gonna party trust me I'm ok
I'll have a heartbreak party
I won't be missing you

But we ain't gon leave together
I would rather be a party of one
Then be unhappy with two forever

Oh you can go
That's ok I'll have a party
Keep the boys up late
We gonna party, trust me I'm ok
I'll have a heartbreak party

I won't waste all of my time
Hoping you gon get it right
I have one thing on my mind, and you need to know it isn't you
So you can go
That's ok, we're gonna have a party I'll keep the boys up late
We gonna party, trust me I'm ok
I'll have a heartbreak party
I won't be missing you
