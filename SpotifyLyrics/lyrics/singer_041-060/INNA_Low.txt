You got me feeling so alive
We better slow down
It's like I'm on a roller coaster ride
And I'm screaming so loud

I got you so hungry
For my love
From the walls
Right down to the floor
An animal
Let me hear you roar
I'll take you to the
Heaven right before

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

Love it how you touch me
You're reading my mind
Close my eyes
I need to see
I feel you inside

I got you so hungry
For my love
From the walls
Right down to the floor
An animal
Let me hear you roar
I'll take you to the
Heaven right before

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

I got you so hungry
For my love
From the walls
Right down to the floor
An animal
Let me hear you roar
I'll take you to the
Heaven right before

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low

We turn the lights down
Low, low, low, low, low
