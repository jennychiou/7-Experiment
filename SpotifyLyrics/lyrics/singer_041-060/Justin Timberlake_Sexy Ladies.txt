I can tell you want girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dude don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes

If you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Timbaland:] Hey girl.

[Justin:] Let me see you work it out.

[Timbaland:] Hey girl.

Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

[Timbaland:] Come on Justin talk to 'em

"'Justin:"'
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
Let me take it off

I know a little girl from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance around
When they hear me rocking the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true

If you know what I'm talking 'bout.

[Timbaland:] Hey girl.

[Justin:] Let me see you work it out.

[Timbaland:] Hey girl.

[Justin:] Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout.

[Timbaland:] Come on Justin talk to 'em.

"'Justin:"'
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off

"'Timbaland:"'
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body [Repeat 3x]

"'Justin:"'
Now break it down
Now move a little bit to the left
Now move back over here to the right
Now let me see you walk, walk, yeah
Let me see you walk
Here comes your part girl

"'Timbaland:"'
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Slow down girl
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Slow down girl
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Slow down girl
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body

"'Justin:"'
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off
