Mama, thank you for who I am
Thank you for all the things I'm not
Forgive me for the words unsaid
For the times I forgot

Mama remember all my life
You showed me love, you sacrificed
Think of those young and early days
How I've changed along the way

And I know you believed
And I know you had dreams
And I'm sorry it took all this time to see
That I am where I am because of your truth
And I miss you, yeah I miss you

Mama forgive the times you cried
Forgive me for not making right
All of the storms I may have caused

And I've been wrong; dry your eyes
And I know you believed
And I know you had dreams
And I'm sorry it took all this time to see
That I am where I am because of your truth
And I miss you, yeah I miss you

Mama remember all my life
You showed me love, you sacrificed
Think of those young and early days
How I've changed along the way

Mama I hope this makes you smile
I hope you're happy with my life
At peace with every choice I made
How I've changed along the way

'Cause I know you believed in all of my dreams
And I owe it all to you,
Mama
