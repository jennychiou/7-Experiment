I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that

Words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react

And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time

Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice
You make it now

Falling slowly
Eyes that know me
And I can't go back

Moods that take me
And erase me
And I'm painted black

Will you have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

So take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time

Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice
You've made it now

So take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time

Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice
You've made it now

I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that
