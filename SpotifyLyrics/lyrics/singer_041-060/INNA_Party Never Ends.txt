I found a special place,
Where everything feels right
No negativity,
Everything's all right
I feel tonight's the night,
I'm here with all my friends
The party never stops,
Party never stops and never ends

Hey, oh, just run away and keep on going,
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Hey oh, the energy keeps you from falling,
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
