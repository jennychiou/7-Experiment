Opening my eyes
Seems like it gets harder sometimes
Look at the skylight
Would you mad at me if I tried running away to it in the night?
I tried to fight
But I'm not strong enough
I just want you here
But I also want to be alone
I don't know what I want anymore

Every now and then
The darkness tries to chase me
And my legs are getting tired of running
Oh, please don't
Please don't let it get to me
Oh, I don't want to give up that easily
But the darkness keeps chasing me

Hiding places remind me of you and I
I wanna call you
But if I hear your voice
I just might cry
And I don't even know what the song's about, anymore
And I don't know what I want, anymore

Every now and then
The darkness tries to chase me
And my legs are getting tired of running
Oh, please don't
Please don't let it get to me
Oh, I don't want to give up that easily
But the darkness keeps chasing-

Weather streams down my cheeks
Look to my eyes
See you're blowing smoke in your ripped jeans
Don't tell me you fell in
The darkness is already seeping through
Oh, can't you see?
I will be different
I'm not sure if I can do it all alone
God, I want to be different
But I'm not sure if I can do it on my own

'Cause every now and then
The darkness tries to chase me
And my legs are getting tired of running
Oh, please don't
Please don't let it get to me
Oh, I don't want to give up that easily
But the darkness keeps chasing me
