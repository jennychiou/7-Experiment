I was just coasting, never really going anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was getting kind of use to staying there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color, makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt, 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
Yeah, you give me butterflies

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand, 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, hmm
You give me butterflies
