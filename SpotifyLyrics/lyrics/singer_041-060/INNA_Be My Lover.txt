I think I'm ready for you
You take my higher, get me to cloud 9
Go up to the light
Yeah you can see who you want
It doesn't matter 'cause we shine tonight
I won't let you go

So baby give me more
Don't let me dancing on my own
Yeah you can fool me on
And I can make your body flow
Cause you, you and I/I will run the show
In this moment you're all I want

Hold me until the end of time
'Cause we are written in the sky
Get close to my lips
Lock you up in my kiss
Tell me you will be mine tonight
You will be mine tonight

Be my lover

Be my lover

Now let me do it to you
You've got my heart beating like a truck
I Show you how It's done
Yeah you can take all you want
Do what you like 'cause I'm all yours tonight
Love my potty ride

So baby give me more
Don't let me dancing on my own
Yeah you can fool me on
And I can make your body flow
Cause you, you and I/I will run the show
In this moment you're all I want

Hold me until the end of time
'Cause we are written in the sky
Get close to my lips
Lock you up in my kiss
Tell me you will be mine tonight
You will be mine tonight

Be my lover

Be my lover

Be my lover

Caught in a moment
It's just you and me
Where have you been all my life
Come be my lover and take me away
Touch me and turn up my heart

Get close to my lips
Lock you up in my kiss
Tell me you will be mine tonight
You will be mine tonight
Be my lover

Be my lover
Be my lover

Be my lover
Be my lover
