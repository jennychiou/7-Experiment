You turn on the light
Then you turn it back off
'Cause sleeping alone, yeah it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink
It's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping

You heard from your friends
That I'm doing okay
And you're thinking, maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know
But I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk
And it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
Know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk
And it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Yeah keep it to yourself

Yeah, when you're drunk
And it's late
And you're sad
And you hate going home alone
'Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah keep it to yourself

Yeah keep it to yourself
