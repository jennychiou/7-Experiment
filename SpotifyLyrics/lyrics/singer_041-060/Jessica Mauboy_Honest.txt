You know it's not even what you've gone and done
That makes me sad I ain't mad,
Never been the type to stop you from having fun,
That ain't me I let you breathe,

It's what I can't understand; you've had my heart there in your hands,
All this time that's gone by, you've still got secrets that you hide,
And it doesn't make no sense to me that every time you speak,
I've still gotta choose what to believe,

Why can't you be honest? I need you to just be honest,
Is that so hard to do, and just tell me the truth,
Why is it so hard for you to be honest?
Admit that you broke your promise?
And hide behind your lies,
Look me in the eyes and be honest,
Be honest, be honest, be honest, be honest,

I don't wanna fight and I'm not breaking up,
And I just want to discuss this thing we call trust,
And I'm reaching out and all I'm trying to say
Is for this to work something's have got to change,

It's what I can't understand; you've had my heart there in your hands,
All this time that's gone by, you've still got secrets that you hide,
And it doesn't make no sense to me that every time you speak,
I've still gotta choose what to believe,

Why can't you be honest? I need you to just be honest,
Is that so hard to do, and just tell me the truth,
Why is it so hard for you to be honest?
Admit that you broke your promise?
And hide behind your lies,
Look me in the eyes, yeah,

Why why why?
Won't you open up to me?
Why why why?
What you hiding underneath?
Why why why?
Why is it that you can't see there no wrong in love no secrets between us,

Why can't you be honest? I need you to just be honest,
Is that so hard to do, and just tell me the truth,
Why is it so hard for you to be honest?
Admit that you broke your promise?
And hide behind your lies,
Look me in the eyes, and be honest
Be honest, be honest, be honest, be honest,
Be honest
Tell me the truth boy
