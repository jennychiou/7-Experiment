Who can say for certain, maybe you're still here?
I feel you all around me your memory, so clear
Deep in the stillness, I can hear you speak
You're still an inspiration
Can it be that you are mine forever love
And you are watching over me from up above?
Fly me up to where you are beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight to see you smile
If only for awhile
To know you're there, a breath away's not far to where you are

Are you gently sleeping here inside my dream?
And isn't faith believing all power can't be seen
As my heart holds you just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me
Everyday, 'cause you are mine forever love
Watching me from up above
And I believe that angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave
Fly me up to where you are beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight to see you smile
I'm where and who I want
To know you're there, a breath away's not far to where you are
I know you're there, a breath away's not far to where you are
