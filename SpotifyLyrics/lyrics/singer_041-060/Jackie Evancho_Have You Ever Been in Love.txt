Have you ever been in love?
Feels just like a mystery,
A story written on the stars,
Jupiter and Mars
Well, I can't see that far.

Have you ever been in love?
It's just like a kaleidoscope,
A thousand tiny shards,
The colours of your heart,
Together and apart.

And I'm happy to believe
But if it's just a feeling,
How will I know?
And if it's something fleeting,
Where does it go?
And can I keep holding it all,
Together alone?
Lately I've been needing love?

Have you ever been in love?
It feels just like a showdown.
The company I keep
Lying at my feet,
You get what you deserve.

Have you ever been in love?
It feels just like a land mine.
The fire in the bright,
The silence and the spite,
And nothing's ever right.

And I'm happy to believe
But if it's just a feeling,
How will I know?
And if it's just a fleeting,
Where does it go?
And can I keep holding it all,
Together alone
Lately I've been needing love

And maybe what I see,
And maybe what I need,
What I cannot believe
But I'm happy to believe in love

Have you ever been in love?
It feels just like home.
And every time it leaves,
Me crying on my knees,
I pray for it again.
