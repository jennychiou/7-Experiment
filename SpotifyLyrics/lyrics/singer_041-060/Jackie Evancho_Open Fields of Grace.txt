Last night
I saw you running
In the open fields of grace
No longer were you broken or in pain

The wind blew kisses through your hair
You laughed with beauty unaware
I wish I could be there with you
In the open fields of grace
In the open fields of grace

Last night I heard you singing
In the open fields of grace
No longer were you silent or afraid
Your voice was innocent and strong

As you proclaimed love's ancient song
Oh, teach me how to sing along with you
In the open fields of grace
In the open fields of grace

When tears are but a memory
We'll run to God like children finally free
In the open fields of grace
In the open fields of grace
Dancing in God's delight
As night fades away

Last night I saw you running
In the open fields of grace
Someday, I'll be running there with you
