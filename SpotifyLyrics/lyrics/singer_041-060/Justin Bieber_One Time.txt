When I met you girl my heart went knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we goin' keep keep climbin' to the mountain top

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right

You're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
