You've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool in so many ways
But I would change my life if you thought you might try to love me
So please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

I'm not a saint
I'm just a man who had heaven and Earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness
And if you could just please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again
'Cause I'll give you my life
Yes, I would, if you would let me try to let me love you
So please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

...Again
You know I love you
Give me one more chance
