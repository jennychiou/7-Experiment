"'The Band Perry"'
Looking out the window
Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really going down tonight

"'Justin Bieber"'
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
"'The Band Perry"'
You should be here with me safe and warm

"'The Band Perry and Justin Bieber"'
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

"'Justin Bieber"'
Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop
Except for the clock on the wall yeah yeah

"'The Band Perry and Justin Bieber"'
I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home

When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I
Till Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here
Oh oh oh oh
I'll be waiting

Waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Looking out the window
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really going down tonight
