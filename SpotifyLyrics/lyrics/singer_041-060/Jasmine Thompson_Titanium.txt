You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticised
But all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice
Sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
