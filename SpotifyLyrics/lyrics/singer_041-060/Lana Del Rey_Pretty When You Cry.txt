All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

I'll wait for you, babe
It's all I do, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do

Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that

I'll wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do

Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Don't say you need me when
You're leaving, you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you

Don't say you need me if
You're leaving us, you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
