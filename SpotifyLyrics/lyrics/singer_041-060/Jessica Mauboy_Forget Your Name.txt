Funny when you had me you didn't do a thing
But now that it's over you're calling out my name
Show up uninvited to each and every place
Beggin' me to come back saying baby I swear I've changed

Well take two steps back
'Cause you're spilling your drink all on me now
And you're killin' my buzz I just wanna have fun while my girls around
Let me make this clear I don't wanna hear what ya talkin' 'bout
It ain't about you now
Ain't about your love I don't wanna hear ya
Turn the music up so I can't remember
Who you ever were outta my life forever
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name

They say that you don't miss a good thing till it's gone
Now look at you crying baby you're alone
Hope you learnt your lesson, can't treat your woman wrong
You can beg all night but I won't be coming home

So take two steps back
'Cause you're spilling your drink all on me now
And you're killin' my buzz I just wanna have fun while my girls around
Let me make this clear I don't wanna hear what ya talkin' 'bout
It ain't about you now
Ain't about your love I don't wanna hear ya
Turn the music up so I can't remember
Who you ever were outta my life forever
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name

I'm not gonna leave this place till I forget your memory
Stay here all night or day until you're erased

Ain't about your love, I don't wanna hear ya
Turn the music up so I can't remember
Who you ever were outta my life forever
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance

Ain't about your love I don't wanna hear ya
Turn the music up so I can't remember
Who you ever were outta my life forever
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name
I just wanna dance dance I just wanna dance
I just wanna dance, when I fall into a trance and I shake you off and forget your name
