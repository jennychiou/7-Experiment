Won't let you rain on my parade
No, I won't let you rain on my parade
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, this is my parade

You hear the beat beat, beatin' up the drum, yeah
I hear the front down the street, they lookin' at me sayin'
The mean attraction, if you're lookin' for some action
Better follow me, we had to the after-party

But if the rain falls down
Imma keep on walking, you can keep on talking
Talking out the storm now
I will stay strong, got my marching moves on
Moving to the song, all damn night long

I'm going to invite everyone so I'm gonna celebrate
If you wanna play then follow me baby
But if you don't, get outta my way
Wont let you rain on my parade
No, I won't let you rain on my parade
I'm gonna take you one step at a time
Don't get outta line
Keeping it low, just so you know
This is my parade

Let's get together, you can put me in the center of attention
Did I mention that nobody does it better?
I got the fire striking up like a match
This ain't no sting wishing that
No matter if the rain is falling down

Its all right, I shine
I wonder why some beast people wanna steal my thunder
I will stay strong, got my marching moves on
Moving to the song, all damn night long

I'm going to invite everyone so I'm gonna celebrate
If you wanna play then follow me baby
But if you don't, get outta my way
Wont let you rain on my parade
No, I won't let you rain on my parade
I'm gonna take you one step at a time
Don't get outta line
Keeping it low, just so you know
This is my parade

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, this is my parade

The crowd is cheering me on
I'm the queen of the show
The sun's coming out so I'm ready to go
So strike up the bell and drown you out with the sound
Like it or not, it's still going down

I'm going to invite everyone so I'm gonna celebrate
If you wanna play then follow me baby
But if you don't, get outta my way
Wont let you rain on my parade
No, I won't let you rain on my parade
I'm gonna take you one step at a time
Don't get outta line
Keeping it low, just so you know
This is my parade

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, this is my parade
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, this is my parade
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, this is my parade
