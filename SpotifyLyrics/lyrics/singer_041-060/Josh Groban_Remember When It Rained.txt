Wash away the thoughts inside
That keep my mind away from you
No more love and no more pride
And thoughts are all I have to do

Ooh, remember when it rained
I felt the ground and looked up high and called your name
Ooh, remember when it rained
In the darkness I remain

Tears of hope run down my skin
Tears for you that will not dry
They magnify the one within
And let the outside slowly die

Ooh, remember when it rained
I felt the ground and looked up high and called your name
Ooh, remember when it rained
In the water I remain

Running down... (x7)

(Music comes in hard)

Ah ah ah ah ah na na
Oh oh ah oh ah na na
Running dowwwwwn...

Ooh, remember when it rained
I felt the ground and looked up high and called your name
Ooh, remember when it rained
In the water I remain
