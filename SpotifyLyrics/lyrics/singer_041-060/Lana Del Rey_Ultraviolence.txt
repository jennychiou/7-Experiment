He used to call me D.N.
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage

Jim told me that
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back
Reminded me of when we were kids

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence

I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me

Jim raised me up
He hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that
Loving him was never enough

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence

I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are

Heaven is on earth
I would do anything for you, babe
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold-like lemonade

I love you the first time
I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa
Comprende mis white lines

'Cause I'm your jazz singer
And you're my cult leader
I love you forever
I love you forever

With his ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (In my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (Riviera girls)

I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
