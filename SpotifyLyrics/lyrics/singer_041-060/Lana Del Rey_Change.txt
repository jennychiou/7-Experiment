There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in hotly and it's coming in strong

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
But who am I to wanna try? But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time something is done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a song
There's something in the water, I can taste it turning sour
It's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time something is done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it
