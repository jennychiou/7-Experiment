Whoa oh, whoa oh, wonderland
Whoa oh, whoa oh, wonderland

We've been through everything
For the last year and a half
Going everywhere, seeing the world
Being my man, being his girl

Come on, sister
(Come on, come on)
Stand up for love
(Come on, come on)

Everybody
(Come on, come on)
Ease up the love
(Come on, come on)

Come on, sister
(Come on, come on)
No more crying
It's around the corner, ain't no denying

Whoa oh
(Gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland

Whoa oh
(Gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland

You will be lying there in the sun
Waiting for shade
It's cool when your coat is
By someone who really cares and to be his girl

Come on, sister
(Come on, come on)
Stand up for love
(Come on, come on)

Everybody
(Come on, come on)
Ease up the love
(Come on, come on)

Come on, sister
(Come on, come on)
No more crying
It's around the corner, ain't no denying

Whoa oh
(Gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland

Whoa oh
(Gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland

Fairy tales
(As if none of that's real)
Do come true
(Gonna make you feel)
If you want them to

Whoa oh
(As if none of that's real
Gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Come on, sister
(Come on, come on)
No more cryin'
It's around the corner, ain't no denyin'

Whoa oh
(As if none of that's real, gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland
Whoa oh
(As if none of that's real, gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland

Whoa oh
(As if none of that's real, gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland
Whoa oh
(As if none of that's real, gonna make you feel)
Whoa oh, wonderland

Fairy tales
(As if none of that's real)
Do come true
(Gonna make you feel)
(As if none of that's real)
(Gonna make you feel)

Whoa oh
(As if none of that's real, gonna make you feel)
