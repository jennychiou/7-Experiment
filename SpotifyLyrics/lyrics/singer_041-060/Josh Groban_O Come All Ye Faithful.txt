O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord.
Come and behold him, born the King of angels;
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation,  
O sing all ye citizens of heaven above; 
Glory to God, Glory in the highest: 


O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord. 

Yes, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning; 
Jesus, to thee be the glory given; 
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing: 
O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord.
