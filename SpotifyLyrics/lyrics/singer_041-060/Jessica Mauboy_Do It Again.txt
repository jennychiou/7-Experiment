I'll do it again, I'll do it again oh mmm
I'll do it all (again, again)

Sometimes I wish we never met
So I wouldn't have to let you go
Wouldn't have to deal with all this pain
'Cause it hurts so much
And it just won't go away
But I know that you just had to go, go, go
And I know it's not your fault
My heart just keeps going going back, back, back
To the way that you loved me
And I, I, I

I know that you
Have to go and do it without me baby
But your the one who said I should wait for you
But everyday seems like I'm waiting for the seasons to change
Everyday feels like I'm moving even further away
And don't pretend your better without me baby
When nothing is as good as it use to be
'Cause only you can come and take away the hurt and pain
Ever though it had to end
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again

I don't know if you feel the same
'Cause I feel like I'm to blame
Always trying to hide what I feel
And I pray for the day to come
When I didn't have to runaway
From the memory of what we had
But I know that you just had to go, go, go
And I know it's not your fault
My heart just keeps going going back, back, back
To the way that you loved me
And I...

I know that you
Have to go and do it without me baby
But your the one who said I should wait for you
But everyday seems like I'm waiting for the seasons to change
Everyday feels like I'm moving even further away
And don't pretend your better without me baby
When nothing is as good as it use to be
'Cause only you can come and take away the hurt and pain
Ever though it had to end
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again

I can't let you go another day
Before I tell you how I feel
Even if the evil wants another chance
I wouldn't be afraid
To do it again (I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again)
Do it all again

You had to go and do it without me baby
But your the one who said I should wait for you
But everyday seems like I'm waiting for the seasons to change
Everyday feels like I'm moving even further away
And don't pretend your better without me baby
When nothing is as good as it use to be
'Cause only you can come and take away the hurt and pain
Ever though it had to end
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again
