Recklessly

Oh girl, it should be me who will take you out
Show you places you always dreamed about
We can run away from here right now
Right now, right now, right now

Recklessly

Oh girl, it should be me who will make you smile
Lift you up if you ever feel down
If I'd be with you somehow, somehow, somehow

You don't know what love is before you've had it all

We can be foolhardy
Leave the world behind and go crazy
Wild and free recklessly
I'll make you feel like you're the one for me
My heart goes boom, boom, boom
When I'm with you, you, you
Don't you see we're meant to be
Live on full attack and recklessly
Oh, oh yeah

Oh girl, it should be me who will love you right
Bring the stars to your sky in the midnight
We would laugh, we would cry, we would feel alive
Alive, alive, alive

So now when we are in this real world
Take a leap and become my girl
Cause now we both know
It's time, it's time, it's time

You don't know what love is before you've had it all

We can be foolhardy
Leave the world behind and go crazy
Wild and free recklessly
I'll make you feel like you're the one for me
My heart goes boom, boom, boom
When I'm with you, you, you
Don't you see we're meant to be
Live on full attack and recklessly
Oh
Recklessly
Recklessly

I don't know if you're the kind of girl
I don't know if you're the kind of girl
Who could jump head first into this wild, wild, wild world
But I'm thinking you're
I'm thinking that you're everything I wanted
So just take all my, my, my, my world
And trust me when, I say that you're
The only one that I'm so crazy for

My heart goes boom, boom, boom
When I'm with you, you, you
Don't you see we're meant to be
Live on full attack and recklessly
Oh
Recklessly
Recklessly
Recklessly
Recklessly
Recklessly
