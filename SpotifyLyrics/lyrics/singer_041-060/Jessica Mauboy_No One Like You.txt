Got used to being alone that I hid the pain of a broken heart
That love thing I tried it over and over 'til I got tired
And I never wanted to keep a smile up, can't deny it was fake to cover up
All of the pain I felt inside but you came in and made everything right

Came into my life, my heart's brand new
And now I give my all, my all to you
It's that kind of love, it's that kind of love
'Cause no matter if I'm down I can count on you
And I'd be crazy if I ever lost you
No one comes close to ya, there'll be no one like ya
No one else in the world
'Cause there's no one like you

You came and kissed my tears away
And now there's nothing left to say
You came in and saved me and now I'm ready for love
Now I look to you without a fear in my heart
It's guaranteed that we will never part
'Cause you love me and I love you
There is no way that I will ever leave, no

Came into my life, my heart's brand new
And now I give my all, my all to you
It's that kind of love, it's that kind of love
'Cause no matter if I'm down I can count on you
And I'd be crazy if I ever lost you
No one comes close to ya, there'll be no one like ya
No one else in the world
'Cause there's no one like you

I've swimmed an ocean and I've climbed a mountain top
I've fought the battle and lost it all 'cause nothing returned
Why not give it up, I thought to myself
'Til there was you, I got another chance with you

Came into my life, my heart's brand new
And now I give my all, my all to you
It's that kind of love, it's that kind of love
'Cause no matter if I'm down I can count on you
And I'd be crazy if I ever lost you
No one comes close to ya, there'll be no one like ya
No one else in the world
'Cause there's no one like you
