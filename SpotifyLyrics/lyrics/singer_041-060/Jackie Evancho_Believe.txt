Children, sleeping
Snow is softly falling
Dreams are calling
Like bells in the distance
We were dreamers
Not so long ago
But one by one, we
All had to grow up

When it seems the magic slipped away...
We find it all again on Christmas Day

Believe in what your heart is saying
Hear the melody that's playing
There's no time to waste
There so much to celebrate
Believe in what you feel inside
Give your dreams the wings to fly
You have everything you need, if you just believe

Trains move quickly
To their journey's end
Destinations...
Are where we begin again
Ships go sailing
Far across the sea
Trusting starlight
To get where they need to be

When it seems that we have lost our way...
We find ourselves again on Christmas Day

Believe in what your heart is saying
Hear the melody that's playing
There's no time to waste
There so much to celebrate
Believe in what you feel inside
And give your dreams the wings to fly
You have everything you need, if you just believe

If you just believe
If you just believe
If you just believe
If you just believe
