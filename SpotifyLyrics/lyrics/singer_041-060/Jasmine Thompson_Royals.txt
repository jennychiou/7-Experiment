I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in a torn up town
No post code envy

But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood, that kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee
And, baby, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this, we didn't come for money

But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals, it don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals, it don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee
And, baby, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy
