The first time that I saw you
I had to get to know you
I could see a sparkle
When you looked in my eyes
And then I saw you smiling
And like a star you're shining
Never had this feeling
You warmed it up inside

It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are

Shining star
Give me, give me, give me, give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
Shining star
Give me, give me, give me, give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now

You tell me that you're lonely
And time is moving slowly
Complaining that you miss me
'Cause I'm never at home
But baby don't you worry
I'll be there in a hurry
I will cross the oceans
To hold you in my arms

It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are

Shining star
Give me, give me, give me, give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
Shining star
Give me, give me, give me, give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now

It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are
It doesn't matter where you are
Your shining light will guide me home to where you are

Shining star
Give me, give me, give me, give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
Shining star
Give me, give me, give me, give me right now
You give me right now
You give me right now
