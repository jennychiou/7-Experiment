1-2-3
I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knockin' 'em down

I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars
But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

Under the foggy day
I'm lookin' for a light
And my only friend
Is workin' tonight

I can't get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song
But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can't believe it won't believe it
Uh
Look what you found!
Yeah baby
Look what I found
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Whoo!
C'mon!
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Heart just layin' on the ground
