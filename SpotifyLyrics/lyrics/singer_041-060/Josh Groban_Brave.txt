Wake up, wake up, the sun cannot wait for long
Reach out, reach out before it fades away
You will find the warmth when you surrender
Smile into the fear and let it play

You wanna run away, run away and you say that it can't be so
You wanna look away, look away but you stay cause' it's all so close
When you stand up and hold out your hand
In the face of what I don't understand
My reason to be brave

Hold on, hold on, so strong, time just carries on
And all that you thought was wrong is pure again
You can't hide forever from the thunder
Look into the storm and feel the rain

You wanna run away, run away and you say that it can't be so
You wanna look away, look away but you stay cause' it's all so close
When you stand up and hold out your hand
In the face of what I don't understand
My reason to be brave

O-oh-oh-oh-oh
O-oh-oh-oh-oh
O-oh-oh-oh-oh

Go on, go on

You wanna run away, run away and you say that it can't be so
You wanna look away, look away but you stay cause' it's all so close
When you stand up and hold out your hand
In the face of what I don't understand
My reason to be brave
