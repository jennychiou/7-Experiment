Take me
To a place you have never been
Make me
Feel like I'm breathing again
Paint me
Color me with you inner visions
Save me
Show me all the things I've been missing
Nothing scares me more
Than losing out on the unknown
Open up the doors
We're stronger together
So wake up
Can you hear the bells they're ringing
Yeah, they're calling out our name
Can you see the tide is rising
Coming closer every day
You hear me 3x
Can you hear me
Can you hear the whistle blowing
Yeah they're calling for a change
Can you feel the sun is getting warmer
There's no time to waste
You hear me 3x
Can you hear me
Listen 2x
Maybe we can be beautiful again
And you and me
We can do anything
Open up the door
Can you hear the bells they're ringing
Yeah, they're calling out our name
Can you see the tide is rising
Coming closer every day
You hear me 3x
Can you hear me
Can you hear the whistle blowing
Yeah they're calling for a change
Can you feel the sun is getting warmer
There's no time to waste
You hear me 3x
Can you hear me
Listen 2x
Can you hear the bells they're ringing
Yeah, they're calling out our name
Can you see the tide is rising
Coming closer every day
You hear me 3x
Can you hear me
Can you hear the whistle blowing
Yeah they're calling for a change
Can you feel the sun is getting warmer
There's no time to waste
You hear me 3x
Can you hear me
