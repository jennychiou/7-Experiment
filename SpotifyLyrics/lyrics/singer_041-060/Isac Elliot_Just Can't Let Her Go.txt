I've been hypnotized by bright red candy lips and angel eyes
I know that it ain't right, her pretty comes with pain
My hands are tied
I want her everybody wants her she knows it
Eh eh eh
I want her but I better run away
'Cause I know oh oh

She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped
She deserves a medal
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la la la la
I just can't let her go

Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind
I want her everybody wants her she knows it
Eh eh eh
I want her but I better run away
'Cause I know oh oh

She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped
She deserves a medal
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go
La la la la la la
I just can't let her go

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one last time
Just one last time

She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped
She deserves a medal
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la la la la
I just can't let her go
