Treat me like your patient
Just don't keep me waiting
Or I'll just be wasted
In a crowd of the lonely
I need you to inspire me
When I can't inspire myself
I need you to provide for me
When I feel like someone else

Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down

Heal me
God knows nothing else is gonna, gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah

Dose me with your energy
Leave your soul inside of me
Cool me down and calm me
Ring me, don't alarm me

Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down

Heal me
God knows nothing else is gonna, gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah

I wanna be more, or equal, not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed
I wanna more, or equal, not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed

Heal me
God knows nothing else is gonna, gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah
