Don't think that your hittin' from a team
'Cause you don't know what it means to be a real man
Don't act like your payin' my bills
When you know your broke ass can't even pay attention

It's not for free boy
Your not the one for me
Just uncanny boy
Your not the one for me

I'm tired of you keeping me down
All the bitches had enough of your demons
I'm tired of the way you get around
You switch your stories and your making me believe 'em
You'll get caught sooner or later
Hey Boy you're not the one for me
Your not the one for me
Wanna be a smooth operator
Hey Boy you're not the one for me
Hey boy the one for me

I don't wanna be with you
Watch this I'm quitting your scene
Before you even know you're on the D list
Watch me gettin' treated like a queen
With a better hearted man
And I'm gonna let him hit this

You'll be sorry when boy
Your not the one for me
Cry in your procardy boy
Your not the one for me

I'm tired of you keeping me down
All the bitches had enough of your demons
I'm tired of the way you get around
You switch your stories and your making me believe 'em
You'll get caught sooner or later
Hey Boy you're not the one for me
Your not the one for me
Wanna be a smooth operator
Hey Boy you're not the one for me
Hey boy the one for me

Live it up now while you can
'Cause it's your last night as my man
Your just a boy who had a girl
And didn't know he had the world
Always thinking you're the one in control
Now it looks like you're feeling lost 'cause

I'm tired of you keeping me down
All the bitches had enough of your demons
I'm tired of the way you get around
You switch your stories and your making me believe 'em
You'll get caught sooner or later
Hey Boy you're not the one for me
Your not the one for me
Wanna be a smooth operator
Hey Boy you're not the one for me
Hey boy the one for me

I don't wanna be with you
