We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Boy you turn me on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Like no other one

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Feel the heat, it's on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Let's turn up the love

Red bull cans, tequila
Say all night
(All night)
Mi casa es tu casa

Table dance
We got sangria
Arriba
Mi casa es tu casa

We can dance, we can jive
We can shake if you wanna
We can touch, we can play
We can do, hey, whatever

The night is young
And you're so fine
Got me dance the Lambada
Oh, we can dance, oh, we can jive
Oh, we can shake if you wanna

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Boy you turn me on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Like no other one

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Feel the heat, it's on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Let's turn up the love

Mi casa es tu casa

Red bull cans, tequila
Body, tequila
Mi casa es tu casa
(Can I get a)

Table dance
We got sangria
Arriba
Mi casa es tu casa

You can dance, you can jive
You can shake if you wanna
You can touch, you can play
You can do, hey, whatever

The night is young
And you're so fine
Got me dance the Lambada
You can dance, you can jive
You can shake if you wanna

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Boy you turn me on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Like no other one

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Feel the heat, it's on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Let's turn up the love

Mi casa es tu casa

Let's release the tension
Feel my body baby
Need no conversation
You had me at hello

Got all of my attention
Feel my body baby
Need no conversation
You had me at hello

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Boy you turn me on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Like no other one

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Feel the heat, it's on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Let's turn up the love

We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Boy you turn me on
We're walking on the sun
Sun, sun
Like no other one
