Staring out at a beautiful sunrise,
I begin taking in all the blue sky,
There are clouds raining down over yesterday,
I wasn't firing in the eye of a hurricane,

I believe, I believe all things happen for a reason,
I believe
I believe
I believe
I was hurt but my heart is still beating,
I believe
I believe
All the joy and the pain the love and heartbreak,
Lead me where I am today,
I believe, I believe I'm sure as I'm breathing,
I believe, I believe it.

You gotta learn when to know when it feels right
You gotta be in the dark to see the light,
Maybe if I'm afraid of failing,
Then it's worth my fall we're saving,

I believe, I believe all things happen for a reason,
I believe
I believe
I believe
I was hurt but my heart is still beating,
I believe
I believe
All the joy and the pain the love and heartbreak,
Lead me where I am today,
I believe, I believe I'm sure as I'm breathing,
I believe, I believe it.

I've got scars and burns, but I've lived and learned,
And I made it through like I always do,

I believe, I believe all things happen for a reason,
I believe
I believe
I believe
I was hurt but my heart is still beating,
I believe
I believe
All the joy and the pain the love and heartbreak,
Lead me where I am today,
I believe, I believe I'm sure as I'm breathing,
I believe it, I believe, I believe,
My heart is still beating,
I believe
I believe
All the joy and the pain the love and heartbreak,
Made me where I am today,
I believe, I believe I'm sure as I'm breathing,
