It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

Word on the street's Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer flying thru the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Hey love, the wise men followed a star
The wise men followed a star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle

Aye love, don't you buy me nothing
Don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a Merry Merry Christmas

It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you (shawty with you)
With you, under the mistletoe
Under the mistletoe

Kiss me underneath the
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

Kiss me underneath the
Kiss me under the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
