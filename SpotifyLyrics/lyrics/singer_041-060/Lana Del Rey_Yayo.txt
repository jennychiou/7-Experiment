I like the snake on your tattoo,
I like the ivy and the ink blue,
Yayo, yes, you, yayo.

You have to take me right now,
From this dark trailer park life now,
Yayo, how now, yayo.

Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do."
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama.

Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
Let me put on a show.
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
Let me put on a show.

I need you like a baby when I hold you,
Like a druggie, like I told you.
Yayo, yes, you, yayo.

Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do."
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama.

Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
Let me put on a show.
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
Let me put on a show.

Hello, Heaven, you are tunnel lined,
With yellow lights on a dark night.
Yayo, yes, you, yayo.

Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do."
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama.

Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
Let me put on a show.
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
Let me put on a show.
