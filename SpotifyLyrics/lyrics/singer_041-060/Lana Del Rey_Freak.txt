Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still I'd take this moment
Make it last forever

Your head lies, full of fire
I'm risin' up, risin' up
My heart loves, full of fire
Love's full of fire, love

Baby if you wanna leave
Come to California, be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity
Loving me is all you need to feel 
Like I do
We could slow dance to rock music
Kiss while we do it
Talk till we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California, be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Turn it up, turn it up
And let's dance by the ocean, ooh-ooh

Baby if you wanna leave
Come to California, be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity
Loving me is all you need to feel 
Like I do
We could slow dance to rock music
Kiss while we do it
Talk till we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California, be a freak like me, too

Oh, you're cold as ice, baby
But when you're on ice, baby
It's so amazing in every way
Oh, you're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay I'll stay, yeah

Baby if you wanna leave
Come to California, be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity
Loving me is all you need to feel 
Like I do
We could slow dance to rock music
Kiss while we do it
Talk till we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California, be a freak like me, too
