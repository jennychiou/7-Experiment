We don't talk much
And I got two years worth of stories
But we don't talk much, no
I don't sleep much
And my heavy head that's full of worry
Hasn't changed much, no

If I call, would you pick up?
It's the only thing I wanna do
And I should stop
'Cause I fucked up
So I'm putting all my tears to use
I wrote a song for you
I wrote a sing for you
Oh yeah, hm

When I wake up
I might just throw away these pages
When I wake up, yeah
I hope you hear this
'Cause face to face
I never say it
That I still feel the same
Time won't heal the pain
I wish you would've stayed, yeah

If I call, would you pick up?
It's the only thing I wanna do
And I should stop
'Cause I fucked up
So I'm putting all my tears to use
I wrote a song for you, oh yeah
I wrote a song for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, hm

You never say enough
And I always say too much
You're there every heart that I break
Every song that I play is for you
And all of our old friends
Asking me how you been
I wish I knew

If I call, would you pick up?
It's the only thing I wanna do
And I should stop
'Cause I fucked up
So I'm putting all my tears to use
I wrote a song for you, oh yeah
I wrote a song for you, oh oh
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah
