I'm a grown up woman but a girl again
It's been like this since I can remember when
Your questioning and answering
You're always talking to me like I can't relate
When all I want to do is to communicate
You were meant to be someone else
I look at the pictures of me and you we're smiling
Tell me what happened to the times when
We understood each other
Yeah

All I need is a little bit of space to breathe
And a little bit of freedom to be who I want to be
Let me be me
Love means learning to let me go and spread my wings
You let me grow and live life you gotta let me be
Let me be me

You try to teach me lessons not to suffocate
Always setting goals that I don't wanna make
And I'm tired of it, sick and tired of it
And it feels just like we're on a one way street

It's only half where we gotta meet, we gotta make
It back
I look at the pictures of me and you we're smiling
Tell me what happened to the times when
We understood each other
Yeah

All I need is a little bit of space to breathe
And a little bit of freedom to be who I want to be
Let me be me
Love means learning to let me go and spread my wings
You let me grow and live life you gotta let me be
Let me be me
Let me be

I look at the pictures of me and you we're smiling
What happened to the times when
We understood each other

All I need is a little bit of space to breathe
And a little bit of freedom to be who I want to be
Let me be me
Love means learning to let me go and spread my wings
You let me grow and live life you gotta let me be
Let me be me

All I need is a little bit of space to breathe
And a little bit of freedom to be who I want to be
Let me be me
Love means learning to let me go and spread my wings
You let me grow and live life you gotta let me be
Let me be me

Let me be, just let me be
Let me be, just let me be
