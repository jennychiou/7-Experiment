So give me the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Ooh, yeah

Anybody can be in love on a sunny day
And anybody can turn and run when it starts to rain
And everybody wishes all the skies were blue
But that ain't the kind of love I'm lookin' to have with you

So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I'll be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff

When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Yeah, I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, yeah)

My God knows I'm not the man that I want to be
And we all know there's things in this life we refuse to see
So just know my fire for you will always burn
And please forgive the things in this life that I have to learn

So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I wanna be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)

When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)

No, we won't have to wonder
Oh, you won't have to wonder
If we're ever goin' under
No, we're never goin' under
No, we're never goin' under

'Cause I want the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I wanna be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff (I want the hard stuff)

When they're throwin' sticks and stones
Cut each other to the bone (break each other to the bone)
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, oh)

Yeah I want the hard stuff (I want the hard stuff)
And I want the hard stuff
Give me the hard stuff
Give me the hard stuff
Yeah I want the hard stuff
So give me the hard stuff
