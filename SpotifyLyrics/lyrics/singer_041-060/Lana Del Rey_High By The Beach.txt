Boy look at you, looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here is harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive, if this is all that's real

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby bye-bye

The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I knew that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby bye-bye

Boy look at you, looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive, we're sinking into the sand

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby bye-bye

The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I knew that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby bye-bye

Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby bye-bye

The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I knew that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby bye-bye

Anyone can start again
Not through love but through revenge
Through the fire we're born again
Peace by vengeance brings the end
