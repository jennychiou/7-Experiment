I'm smoking while I'm runnin' on my treadmill
But I'm coming up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser
I'm crying while I'm cummin'
Making love while I'm making good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee
Because I fell for another loser

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time
While you're taking what's mine, with the things that you're doing
Talk that talk, well now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings (got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again (I'm making love songs all around)
Drown out all our screaming (Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's free-er than me?
You wanna make the switch, be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

I'm smoking while I'm running
This town and you better believe it honey
I'm laughing as I'm taking my prisoners
And taking down names
I'm crying while I'm gunning
In the smoke they can hear me coming
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time while you're taking what's mine
While you know what you're doing
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings (got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again (I'm making love songs all around)
Drown out all our screaming (Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's free-er than me?
You wanna make the switch, be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

Got me up in this place right now
Making no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feeling so blue
Making no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

'Cause you got me in my feelings (got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again (I'm making love songs all around)
Drown out all our screaming (Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's free-er than me?
You wanna make the switch, be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings
