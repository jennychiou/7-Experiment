Took a car to Rio
Crossed the border to Mexico
Ten hours straight
Down to the sea

And my heart was racing
'Cause I know
That you'll be waiting
Same time and place
We always meet

Outside
Drinking, the moonlight
You fill up all my
My fantasies

Outside
Stars are in your eyes
We're dancing all night
More memories

One more time
Under the Salina skies
As I hold you
In these arms of mine

One more time
Under the Salina skies

Never mind siesta
We can start own fiesta
We're the only ones
Left on the beach

Foamy like the ocean
Let me drown
In your emotions
I'm ready to learn
If you will teach

Outside
Drinking, the moonlight
You fill up all my
My fantasies

Outside
Stars are in your eyes
We're dancing all night
More memories

One more time
Under the Salina skies
As I hold you
In these arms of mine

One more time
Let's celebrate
Our love tonight
I can tell by the look
In your eyes

Next year, year
We'll be right here, here
We'll meet again, babe
No sad goodbyes

One more time
Under the Salina skies

One more time
Under the Salina skies
As I hold you
In these arms of mine

One more time
Let's celebrate
Our love tonight
I can tell by the look
In your eyes

Next year, year
We'll be right here, here
We'll meet again, babe
No sad goodbyes

One more time
Under the Salina skies
