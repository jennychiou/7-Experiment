I can't lie, Boy I've been missing you tonight
I thought that this would fade with time, time time,
And I don't wanna go out there but right now I'm so out there,
Why's it feeling like I'm just loosing like I'm just losing control,
Why do I keep wanna call keep wanna your phone,
Maybe I don't wanna be don't wanna be alone,
And I can't help but think that you're feeling like me,

Something in the air tonight, something on the radio, something that I drove by,
Tell me that I'm on your mind; just say it and I'll be there,
Faster than the speed of light,
Or a shot of a bullet,
In the dead of night I'll run right to you,
Tell me that I'm on your mind; just say it and I'll be there,

It's crazy I can't even go to sleep cause I know that you'll be in my dreams,
Baby this is unfair I wish that you were right here,
Why's it feeling like I'm just losing like I'm just losing control,
Feels like I'm one second from walk walking out that door,
Maybe I don't wanna be don't wanna be alone,
And I can't help but think that you're feeling like me,

Something in the air tonight, something on the radio, something that I drove by,
Tell me that I'm on your mind; just say it and I'll be there,
Faster than the speed of light,
Or a shot of a bullet,
In the dead of night I'll run right to you,
Tell me that I'm on your mind; just say it and I'll be there,

Oh I don't know why I still love you,
Cause I gotta good guy but he just ain't you,
Doing it like you do, so what am I supposed to do,

Something in the air tonight, something on the radio, something that I drove by,
Tell me that I'm on your mind; just say it and I'll be there,
Faster than the speed of light,
Or a shot of a bullet,
In the dead of night I'll run right to you,
Tell me that I'm on your mind; just say it and I'll be there,
I'd be there if you told me to baby,
I'd leave him if you'd wanted baby,
I know it's wrong but I don't care baby,
Boy I'd be there I'd be there,
I'd be there if you told me to baby,
I'd leave him if you'd wanted baby,
I know it's wrong but I don't care baby,
Boy I'd be there I'd be there
