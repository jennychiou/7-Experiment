There's something about her, she ain't got nothing to prove
She walk in here without no invitation
And I'm right behind her 'cause I got nothing to lose

She say what she wanna
Wear what she wanna
Be what she wanna
Do what she wanna do
Right when she wanna
Come when she wanna
She gonna blow me away

Ayo, sshe came out just to play, yo
Not gonna get in the way, yo

I just can't stayaway, yo
Ain't gonna make her stop

Anything she want, she know she can take it
I'm getting wrapped up in all of that attitude (attitude)
If she a mistake then I guess I'mma make it (I'mma make it)
I hate that I love it, I can't rise above it
I'm so confused (yeah)

She say what she wanna
Wear what she wanna
Be what she wanna
