Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad
All the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands
On my body
Tell me you want me tonight

I'm looking
For my Mr. Wrong
If that's all right
Then let me know

I know exactly
What you want
But if you tell me
We can go

So put your summer hands
All over my summer body
You'll get some of this
After my summer party

I can make it hard
If that's the way you want it
If that's the way you want it

Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad
All the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands
On my body
Tell me you want me tonight

I'm looking
For my Mr. Wrong
If that's all right
Then let me know

I know exactly
What you want
But if you tell me
We can go

So put your summer hands
All over my summer body
You'll get some of this
After my summer party

I can make it hard
If that's the way you want it
If that's the way you want it

Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad
All the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands
On my body
Tell me you want me tonight

Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad
All the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands
On my body
Tell me you want me tonight
