Under pressure
Some might break
I pack my troubles in a suitcase
Travel heavy
On my way
I wonder who will wipe your tears away

And I know
And I know
And I know
You'll wait, wait till I'm coming home
But I want you here
Be part of my journey

Let's run away for a moment
Just take the time and come with me
On this great escape
I know you're worried see your burdens
So take the time and come with me
On this great escape

Darling I'm here for you
Darling I care for you
Darling I want you to
Come with me on this great escape
Darling I'm here for you
Darling I care for you
Darling I want you to
Come with me on this great escape

I wanna see what
We could make
Of a different life
In a different place
Please convince me that you've changed
Will you be there to wipe my tears away

And I know
And I know
And I know
You'll wait, wait till I'm coming home
But I want you here
Be part of my journey

Let's run away for a moment
Just take the time and come with me
On this great escape
I know you're worried see your burdens
So take the time and come with me
On this great escape

Darling I'm here for you
Darling I care for you
Darling I want you to
Come with me on this great escape
Darling I'm here for you
Darling I care for you
Darling I want you to
Come with me on this great escape

You've been uneasy
You've been down
You've been out so
Let's take it easy
Let's leave town for a while oh
You've been uneasy
You've been down
You've been out so
Let's take it easy
Let's leave town for a while oh

Let's run away for a moment
Just take the time and come with me
On this great escape
I know you're worried see your burdens
So take the time and come with me
On this great escape

Darling I'm here for you
Darling I care for you
Darling I want you to
Come with me on this great escape
Darling I'm here for you
Darling I care for you
Darling I want you to
Come with me on this great escape
