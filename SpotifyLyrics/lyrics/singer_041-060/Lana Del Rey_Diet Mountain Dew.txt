You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now, love down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we going to take a ride
I'm not going to listen to what the past says
I've been waiting up all night

Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's going to teach me just what fast is
Say it's going to be all right

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now, love down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times

Maybe I like this roller-coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now, love down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you

You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you, I want you

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty

Baby, stopping at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
