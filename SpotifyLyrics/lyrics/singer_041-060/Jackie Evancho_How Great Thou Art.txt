O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

And when I think of God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And lead me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow with humble adoration
And then proclaim, 'my God, how great Thou art'

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
