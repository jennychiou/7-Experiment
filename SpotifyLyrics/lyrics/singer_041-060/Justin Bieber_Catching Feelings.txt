The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what I'm supposed to do

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

In my head we're already together
I'm cool alone, but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just trying to see where this can take us
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now it's left to do now, let's get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Should I tell her, how I really feel
Or should I moving closer just be still
How would I know?
'Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same?

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Catching feelings, catching feelings
