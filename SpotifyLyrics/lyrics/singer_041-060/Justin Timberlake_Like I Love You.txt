Just somethin' about you
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
Gettin' scared now, right
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right, listen

I kinda noticed something one night,
In the club a frump face,
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so is datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Yeah
You know I could make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, hold my jacket
And then...

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just want to love you baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby)
Girl...

(Pusha T)
Ma' whatcha wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'
Point to me I say 'Yeah, it's the same dough'
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night

(Malice)
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
(I just love your... brain...)
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain'
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl...
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl...)

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya
(Can't love ya like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Makes me trust ya like I do, hey)
Late at night I talk to you (hey)
You will know the difference when I...

(Break it down)

You know
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way
Drums... (hey)

It's kinda special right, yeah
You know, if you think about it
Sometimes people are just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is

Now everybody dance
