It's not like I'm invisible
You still wear me under your skin
When we talk we don't talk at all
Too weak to leave, too stubborn to give in

Who is gonna be the first to say a truce?
It's not enough that we should part
Can't stop fighting too

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you and you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery

Free, well, oh, can't you see?
I wanna be, I want you to be free

It's not like she isn't loving you
It's just that you can't be alone for too long
I'd like to wish you all the happiness
Maybe the truth is it will kill me if you move on

Who is gonna be the first to say enough?
Who is gonna be the first one to find true love?

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you and you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery

Free, well, oh, can't you see
I wanna be, I want you to be free

Let it be, let it be just a beautiful memory
Anything that starts will have an ending
Let it go, let it go, yeah 'cause we both know
This will only be over when we're free

Oh, when we're free, oh, I know

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you and you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery

Free, well, oh, can't you see
I wanna be, I want you to be free
I wanna be, I want you to be, oh can't we be free
Oh, I wanna be free
