Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dongâ€¦.

Ding dong merrily on high,
In heaven the bells are ringing:
Ding dong! verily the sky
Is riven with angel singing.
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong...

E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swung,
And "Io, io, io!"
By priest and people singing.
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

Pray you, dutifully prime
Your matin chyme, ye ringers;
May you beautifully rime
Your evetime song, ye singers.
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Hosanna in excelsis!
