Oh my God it's you, I never thought I'd see you here.
Looks like all is well, like you're having a hell of a good time.
Me? Not gonna lie.

Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four leaf clovers
Yeah my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck,
The stars are all lined up,
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you.

You can have your cake and eat it too, I should have known
'Cause what good is good anyway
And having it all is just a state of mind
And I, I got no reason to cry

I got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four leaf clovers
Yeah my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck,
The stars are all lined up,
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you.

Been kissed by Lady Luck,
The stars are all lined up,
Every arrow that I aim is true.
I got a big smile on my face
The best one I can fake
I'm as happy as half a heart can do
But I miss you.
