Tried to keep my heart
From falling, yeah
Oh, no way to resist it, no

And now summer is gone
And we are drunk in love
But you're going away

Boy, don't get me wrong
I'm just a girl in love
And I want you to stay

So just fool me, fool me
Fool me that is all I'm asking for
Here to watch your body tempo
'Cause you won't be here no more

Can't you see my heart is beating
Like it never did before
You're the one

Tried to keep my heart
From falling, yeah
Oh, no way to resist it, no

And now summer is gone
And we are drunk in love
But you're going away

Boy, don't get me wrong
I'm just a girl in love
And I want you to stay

So just fool me, fool me
Fool me that is all I'm asking for
Here to watch your body tempo
'Cause you won't be here no more

Can't you see my heart is beating
Like it never did before
You're the one

I am dreaming of a life
Where I will let you know
Why I love you so

'Cause I'm melting in your eyes
I can let you know
Why can't I let you go

So just fool me, fool me
Fool me that is all I'm asking for
Here to watch your body tempo
'Cause you won't be here no more

Can't you see my heart
Is beating like it never did before
You're the one
