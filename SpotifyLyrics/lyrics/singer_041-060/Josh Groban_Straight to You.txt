All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows sharpen their beaks
This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running
Straight to you, for I am captured
Straight to you for I am captured one more time

The light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge
Well now sorrow it comes a stealing
And I'll cry girl but I'll come running
Straight to you for I am captured
Straight to you for I am captured once again

And gone are the days of rainbows

And gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
For the sea will swallow up the mountain
And the sky will throw thunderbolts and sparks
Straight at you, but I'll come running
Straight to you, but I'll come running one more time

Heaven has denied us its kingdom
The saints are drunk and howling at the moon
And the chariots of angels are colliding
Well I'll run babe, I'll come running
Straight to you for I am captured
Straight to you for I am captured one more time
