We've been friends for so long, I can't deny
These feelings are so strong, I keep hot inside
I wanna tell you but I can't find the words to say
So afraid if I do things will never be the same
I gotta work it out, time's really running out
Don't know what to do but I know I gotta say it now
Don't wanna lose a friend, but why should I pretend
That I don't love you when I've waited so long

(So long) been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
I can't hold it back 'cause I've been waiting so long,
Been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
Been waiting (so long) I've been waiting so long,
I've been trying to tell ya, tell ya,
That we should be together, everyday,
Boy you're giving me something, something, oh
And I'm crazy in love with all you do,
Boy you're giving me something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, something

When you come to me and say some other girl has broke your heart once again
Will you ever learn? All this time I've been patiently
Hoping that you would notice me, you need to know that I've been waiting so long

(So long) been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
I can't hold it back 'cause I've been waiting so long,
Been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
Been waiting (so long) I've been waiting so long,
I've been trying to tell ya, tell ya,
That we should be together, everyday,
Boy you're giving me something, something, oh
And I'm crazy in love with all you do,
Boy you're giving me something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, something

(So long) been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
I can't hold it back 'cause I've been waiting so long,
Been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
Been waiting (so long) I've been waiting so long,
I've been trying to tell ya, tell ya,
That we should be together, everyday,
Boy you're giving me something, something, oh
And I'm crazy in love with all you do,
Boy you're giving me something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, something
