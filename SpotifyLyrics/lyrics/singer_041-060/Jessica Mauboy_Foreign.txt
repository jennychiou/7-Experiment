Now, you know we could just exchange numbers but then that be boring
Come an' sit front row in the range
'Cause I'm flooring it
Tryin' getcha away from the crowd, go exploring
I could have you wide open like new territory
I may not be Columbus but I stumbled upon something kinda wonderous
Your body plus my body means somebody's getting comfortable
I'm talking slick, but I ain't playin'
One touch, I'll have you out of this world like I'm alien

I'm gonna love you, love you, love you like, like, I'm from overseas
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you like, like, you ain't ever seen
Let me give you a warning, your body I'll be touring
Like no other woman, I love you like I'm foreign
Let me have that baby, let me have that
Let me have that baby, let me have that
If you can hold it then baby you can grab it
If you can grab it then boy you better claim it

Now I can get you 100 degrees, have you bakin'
If you like it chilled, get you cooler than a penguin
Whatever you like, serve it up, where's my apron
If you roll the dice, I'll invite you in the playpen
You ain't gotta lie, let's be clear, I know you're new to this
It's your first time in the presence of a goddess
I won't steer you wrong, come along for the ride boy
You can have the treasure, if you're man enough to dig for it

I'm gonna love you, love you, love you like, like, I'm from overseas
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you like, like, you ain't ever seen
Let me give you a warning, your body I'll be touring
Like no other woman, I love you like I'm foreign
Let me have that baby, let me have that
Let me have that baby, let me have that
If you can hold it then baby you can grab it
If you can grab it then boy you better claim it

I can feel the chemistry between you and me
And it's so unique I just can't shake it babe
And I can't put my finger on it, but I wanna put 'em on you
'Cause I know you and me belong, so let's do what we came to do

I'm gonna love you, love you, love you like, like, I'm from overseas
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you like, like, you ain't ever seen
Let me give you a warning, your body I'll be touring
Like no other woman, I love you like I'm foreign
Let me have that baby, let me have that
Let me have that baby, let me have that
If you can hold it then baby you can grab it
If you can grab it then boy you better claim it
