Picked you out and picked you up
Hoping that my luck would change
I let the summer fill my lungs
And superstition fill my brain

Dandelion
A million little wishes float across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and it's a waste of time I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me cryin' dandelion

Sent you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinking it could change my world

Dandelion
A million little wishes float across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and it's a waste of time I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me cryin' dandelion

Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more
Oh, dandelion

Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowing kisses out across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and it's a waste of time I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me cryin' dandelion

Dandelion
