I hear you calling Inndia

Welcome to India
You don't need nobody but India
She's enough to make your body go wild
I can live my life here right now

It's a little bit scandalous
But she lives her life a little bit dangerous
Everybody in the club, can you handle us?
I can live my life here right now

Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move?
Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no

The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no

I hear you calling Inndia [x2]

Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move?
Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no

The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no

I hear you calling Inndia [x2]

Everybody stand up
I wanna se your hands up
I wanna see you move your body, girl don't stop
And if you're ballin'
Let me hear you callin'
'Cause we'll be at the after party, till the mornin'

Everybody stand up
I wanna se your hands up
I wanna see you move your body, girl don't stop
And if you're ballin'
Let me hear you callin'
'Cause we'll be at the after party, till the mornin'

Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move?
Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no

The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no
