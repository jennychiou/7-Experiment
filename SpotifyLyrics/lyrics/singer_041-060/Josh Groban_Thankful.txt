(Dean Pitchford, Richard Page, Tom Snow)

Here we are again;
I guess it must be fate.
We've tried it on our own,
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight.

I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new.
Every memory repeats,
Every step I take retreats,
Every Christmas always brings me back to you.

So for tonight we pray for,
What we know can be,
And on this day we hope for,
What we still can't see,
It's up to us, to be the change,
And even though we all can still do more,
There's so much to be thankful for.

When love is truly right
It lives from year to year.
It changes as it goes,
And on the way it fears,
Each of us most find our truth,
It's so long overdue,

So for tonight we pray for,
What we know can be,
And everyday, we hope for,
What we still can't see,
It's up to us, to be the change,
And even though we all can still do more,
There's so much to be thankful for,

Even with our differences,
There is a place we're all connected,
Each of us can find each other's light,

So for tonight, we pray for
What we know can be,
And on this day, we hope for,
What we still can't see.
It's up to us, to be the change,
And even though this world needs so much more
There's so much to be thankful for.
