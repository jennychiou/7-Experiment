Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, prepare us as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow on the ground, I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Auburn on the mountainside
