The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smooths the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summer time

Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arms

And if you've learned your lessons well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smooths the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summer time

Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arms

And if you've learned your lessons well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall
