Something about you just got me crazy and wild.
Can't describe what I'm feeling but yes I like what I see in ya, babe.
I just wonder why you're staring around.
Got your eyes on the ceiling, as if the wallpapers peeling, babe.

I bet you that I know just what to do,
To make you come my way.
I'm sure you're blood is pumping when I move,
When you say,
In your dreams,
I'm the bitch,
That you don't wanna miss.

So, turn ya head,
Fix your eyes on this, ain't nothing like a show.
Turn ya head,
Keep the dance floor lit.
Ain't nothing like a show.

Loves an exhibition,
So let me put you in the light
I'm gonna start a mission,
To take you home with me tonight.

Get stereo pumping
'Cause we're taking it down.
If you're hungry for pleasure,
I can serve you a measure, babe.
Serenade me while I'm surfing the crowd
Got my eyes on the ceiling;
Hah hah
Heavy breathing, babe.

I bet you that I know just what to do,
To make you come my way.
I'm sure you're blood is pumping when I move,
When you say,
In your dreams,
I'm the bitch,
That you don't wanna miss.

So, turn ya head,
Fix your eyes on this, ain't nothing like a show.

Turn ya head,
Keep the dance floor lit.
Ain't nothing like a show.

Loves an exhibition,
So let me put you in the light
I'm gonna start a mission,
To take you home with me tonight.

Come watch me
I love it when your eyes are on me.
This closely,
And let me tell you I won't give up.
Till you love me-
Got me losing my mind, got me losing my head,
Now I'm stuck and there's no escaping.
All I need is your heart, all I need is your head,
Can't you see that I'm done with waiting?


So turn ya head,
Baby, just turn ya head,

Baby-

So, turn ya head,
Fix your eyes on this, ain't nothing like a show.
Turn ya head,
Keep the dance floor lit.
Ain't nothing like a show.

Loves an exhibition,
So let me put you in the light
I'm gonna start a mission,
To take you home with me tonight.

Loves an exhibition,
So let me put you in the light
I'm gonna start a mission,
To take you home with me tonight.

So, turn ya head.
