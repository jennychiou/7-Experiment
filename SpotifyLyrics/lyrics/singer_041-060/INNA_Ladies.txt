All the girls
Are hear me now
Listen when I call you
Ladies

You don't have
To trust a man
That is driving a Mercedes

You don't know, boy
How hard I try
Being just here
Not with you baby

Someday you should
Tell me why
Why you do this to me, baby

You don't love me now
You just hurt me now
It's over, it's over

I'm not looking back
I'm not going back
It's over, it's over

You don't love me now
You just hurt me now
It's over, it's over

I'm not looking back
I'm not going back
It's over, it's over

You don't love me now

You don't love me now
You just hurt me now
It's over, it's over

I'm not looking back
I'm not going back
It's over, it's over

You don't love me now
You just hurt me now
It's over, it's over

I'm not looking back
I'm not going back
It's over, it's over

All the girls
Are hear me now
Listen when I call you
Ladies

You don't have
To trust a man
That is driving a Mercedes

You don't know, boy
How hard I try
Being just here
Not with you baby

Someday you should
Tell me why
Why you do this to me, baby

You don't love me now
You just hurt me now
It's over, it's over

I'm not looking back
I'm not going back
It's over, it's over

You don't love me now
You just hurt me now
It's over, it's over

I'm not looking back
I'm not going back
It's over, it's over
