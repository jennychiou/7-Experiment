You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more

Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah
