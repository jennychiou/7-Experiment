We can go for miles after midnight
Tracing every shadow till the daylight
Going off the edge just to feel what it's like
What it's like what it's like

You wanna go right you wanna go left
You know I don't mind
My feet on the edge and I come alive
Come alive, come alive
I feel invincible anywhere with you
Indestructible I go I go
To the end of the earth with you
With you
With you
I go I go
To the end of the earth with you

It's a technical dream all around me
I let you... a deed through my body
Push me off the edge 'cause with you I can fly
I can fly I can fly

You wanna go right you wanna go left
You know I don't mind
My feet on the edge and I come alive
Come alive, come alive
I feel invincible anywhere with you
Indestructible I go I go
To the end of the earth with you
With you
With you
I go I go
To the end of the earth with you
I go I go
To the end of the earth with you

I feel invincible
Anywhere with you
Indestructible
I go I go
To the end of the earth with you
With you
With you
I go I go
To the end of the earth with you
