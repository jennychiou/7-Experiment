"'Lana Del Rey"'
Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
Till it runs red, runs red with blood

We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

"'Lana Del Rey"' & "'Stevie Nicks"'
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems
God knows, we've got them

But we've gotta try
La-la-lie
Every day and night
La-la-lie

"'Stevie Nicks"'
Blue is the color of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

"'Lana Del Rey"' & "'Stevie Nicks"'
And when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
(There's no wasted love)

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems
God knows, we've got them

But we've gotta try
La-la-lie
Every day and night
La-la-lie

"'Lana Del Rey"'
Yeah, we've gotta try
La-la-lie
We gotta walk through fire
La-la-lie

Because we're...

"'Lana Del Rey"' & "'Stevie Nicks"'
Because we're beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems
God knows, we've got them
(Beautiful people)

Beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems
God knows, we've got them
So beautiful

Yeah, yeah, yeah
