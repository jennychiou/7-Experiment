Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful

Hands up, you're mine
Come close, I don't mind
No rush, it's fine
Times on your side

Don't stray away babe
Your kiss, your touch awakes me
And we're so connected
No one, nothing can break it
You make me feel

Beautiful, beautiful
I wanna be, with you with you
Forever that should be around
In my life, I feel beautiful
Forever that should be around
In my life, I feel beautiful

Lets dance all night
Keep your body on mine
Don't stop live your life
Your love shines bright

I feel it baby
Your kiss, your touch awakes me
And we're so connected
And no one, nothing can break it
You make me feel

Beautiful, beautiful
I wanna be, with you with you
Forever that should be around
In my life, I feel beautiful
Forever that should be around
In my life, I feel beautiful

Hearts don't lie
Baby can I spend my life
In your arms I know I'm safe forever
No one loves me better

Hearts don't lie
Baby can I spend my life
In your arms I know I'm safe forever
No one loves me
You make me feel

Beautiful, beautiful
I wanna be, with you with you
Forever that should be around
In my life, I feel beautiful
Forever that should be around
In my life, I feel beautiful
