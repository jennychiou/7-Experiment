In this world 
You tried
Not leaving me alone behind
There's no other way
I'll pray to the gods
Let him stay

The memories ease the pain inside
Now I know why
All of my memories
Keep you near
In silent moments

Imagine you'd be here
All of my memories
Keep you near
The silent whispers
Silent tears

Made me promise I'd try
To find my way back in this life
I hope there is a way
To give me a sign you're okay
Reminds me again
It's worth it all
So I can go home

All of my memories
Keep you near
In silent moments
Imagine you'd be here

All of my memories
Keep you near
The silent whispers
Silent tears

Together in all these memories
I see your smile
All the memories I hold dear
Darling 
You know I love you 
Till the end of time

All of my memories
Keep you near
In silent moments
Imagine you'd be here

All of my memories
Keep you near
The silent whispers
Silent tears
