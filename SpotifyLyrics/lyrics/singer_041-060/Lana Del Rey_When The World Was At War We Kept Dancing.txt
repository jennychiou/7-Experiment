Girls, don't forget your pearls
And all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls
And all of your courses 
Memorize them in a little song

Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the free and brave)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

No, it's only beginning
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy ending

When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the free and brave)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

No, it's only the beginning
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy ending

When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

We'll do it again
(Oh my God, dizzy from loving you)
We'll do it again
(Oh my God, dizzy from loving you)
We'll do it again
(Dizzy from, dizzy from loving you)
We'll do it again
(When the world's at war)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

They'll do it again
And we'll do it again
