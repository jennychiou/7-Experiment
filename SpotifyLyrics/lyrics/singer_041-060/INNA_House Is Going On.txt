The house is going on
The house is going on

The house is going on
The house is going on

I wanna tell you that tonight
I'm gonna break the show
I wanna take you really high
And drop you low, low

I listen to my music
When I'm walking down the street
I'm turn it up the volume
Just to make you feel my beat

The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on

Sound for the people
Now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

Sound for the people
Now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

The house is going on
The house is going on

Sound for the people
Now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

The house is going on

Sound for the people
Now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

The house is going on
The house is going on

The house is going on
The house is going on

The house is going on

Don't stop
Don't give it up
I feeling that
I have to sight, now

I won't give it up
I wanna feel it
Maybe right now

Don't stop
Don't give it up
I feeling that
I have to sight, now

I won't give it up
I wanna feel it
Maybe right now

The house is going on
The house is going on
The house is going on

Sound for the people
Now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

The house is going on

Sound for the people
Now heart beats faster
Heart beats faster
Heart beats faster

The house is going on
