Far across this red horizon
I am walking down the line
I am picking up the pieces
That this storm has left behind

After all the clouds are fallen
I would breach the battered ground
Turn your darkness into light love
Turn your silence into sound

But I can't cage you in my arms
When my heart is jumping forward
To avoid your false alarms
And you can't tell me not to stay
When I opened up your window
And I watched you fly away

Have you raised the final anchor
Have you cut the lesson free
Sending off our due redemption
Like a funeral at sea

I will always hear you calling
You're the way of falling leaves
Like a bird you'll spiral onwards
And you know just where I'll be

And I can't cage you in my arms
When my heart is jumping forward
To avoid your false alarms
And you can't tell me not to stay
When I opened up your window
And I watched you fly away

And I can't cage you in my arms
When my heart is jumping forward
To avoid you false alarms
And you can't tell me not to stay
When I opened up your window
And I watched you fly away

I am closing up my window
Till I see a blue horizon
And the quiet calm of love will fly my way
