Play house, put my,
Favorite record on.
Get down, get your,
Crystal Method on.

You were like tall, tan,
Drivin' round the city.
Flirtin' with the girls like,
"You're so pretty."

[[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] is the king,
Don't you think?
I was like "Hell yeah,
That guy can sing."

Like, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, whoa.

You make me crazy,
You make me wild.
Just like a baby, spin me,
'Round like a child.
Your skin so gold and brown,
Be young, be dope, be proud.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Drive fast, I can,
Almost taste it now,
L.A., I don't even,
Have to fake it now.

You were like so sick,
Everybody said it,
You were way ahead of the,
Trend, get, get it.

[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] is the best,
Hell yes,
Honey, put on
That party dress.

Like, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, whoa.

You make me crazy,
You make me wild.
Just like a baby, spin me,
'Round like a child.
Your skin so gold and brown,
Be young, be dope, be proud.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Everybody wants to go fast,
But they can't compare.
I don't really want the rest,
Only you can take me there.
I don't even know what I'm saying,
But I'm praying for you.

You make me crazy,
You make me wild.
Just like a baby, spin me,
'Round like a child.
Your skin so gold and brown,
Be young, be dope, be proud.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Like an American.
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh.

Like an American.
