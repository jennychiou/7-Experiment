When did this house get so big and when did I get so small
Seems like the days get longer and our time's getting shorter
Sitting here for hours trying not to doubt us but it's hard 'cause I'm alone
I know you're busy but then don't ya miss me
I thought you did but I guess you don't

Baby something's wrong, I'm always alone
Still trying to hold on but
You ain't never here for me
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Don't wanna move on but
You ain't never here for me
Baby this is what you need 'cause you keep on hurting me
You gon' make me up and leave, up and leave
And you'll see what it's like to be in love alone
'Cause you ain't never here for me, for me, for me
'Cause you ain't never here for me, for me, for me

How can the sun be shining and my heart feel so cold
Is that rainwater fallin' or my tears on the floor
Talkin' to myself but that don't really help
No that don't take the place of you
I know you're busy, but you need to hear me
I'm getting close to being gone

Baby something's wrong, I'm always alone
Still trying to hold on but
You ain't never here for me
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Don't wanna move on but
You ain't never here for me
Baby this is what you need 'cause you keep on hurting me
You gon' make me up and leave, up and leave
And you'll see what it's like to be in love alone
'Cause you ain't never here for me

Baby something's wrong, I'm always alone
Still trying to hold on but
You ain't never here for me
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Don't wanna move on but
You ain't never here for me
Baby this is what you need 'cause you keep on hurting me
You gon' make me up and leave, up and leave
And you'll see what it's like to be in love alone
'Cause you ain't never here for me, for me
Baby you ain't never here for me
Baby you ain't never here for me
