I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me,

Girl it's getting late,
The sun's going down,
And it's about time I shake my way across the town,
But before I go I just wanna say that you stay on my mind each and every day,

I think I'm starting to like the time that we spent
And when it's building inside
Then I can't pretend
No I don't want to fight it
I don't want to hide the way I feel so I guess it's time for me to say

That I got eyes for you baby,
I want us to be together,
And if you feel it too,
Tell me no one will treat you better,

Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say
Hope this will last forever,

Don't know if it's love
It's too early to say
But if it's something like it I want it to remain
Don't know if you're the one that takes a little time
But in the meantime girl you feel just fine,

Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if it's a hint of what's to come then baby can I get some more
Not trying to be too forward but I think it's best for you to know

I got eyes for you baby,
I want us to be together, be together
And if you feel it too,
Tell me no one will treat you better (baby no one will treat you better)

Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say
Hope this will last forever,

I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me,
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me,

I got eyes for you baby,
I want us to be together, be together
And if you feel it too,
Tell me no one will treat you better,

Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say
Hope this will last forever,

I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me,
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla,
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me
