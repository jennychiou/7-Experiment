There was a field in my old town
Where we always played hand in hand
The wind was gently touching the grass
We were so young so fearless
Then I dreamt over and over
Of you holding me tight under stars
I made a promise to my dear Lord
I will love you forever

Time has passed
So much has changed
But the field remains in my heart
Oh, where are you?
I need to tell you I still love you
So I reach out for you

You fly around me like a butterfly

Your voice still echoes in my heart
You are my true love

There was a field in my old town
Where in spring all flowers blossomed wide
We were chasing butterflies
Hand in hand till close of day

Your voice still echoes in my heart
