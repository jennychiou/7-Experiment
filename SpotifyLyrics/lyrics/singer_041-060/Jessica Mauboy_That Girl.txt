[Chorus] You might be thinkin', thinkin'
Maybe, maybe I'm just like that girl
Ooh
And just because I'm with you doesn't mean that
I should be that girl
Oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah [repeat]

I don't think you really know
What it is you want from me
Baby all you ever do is try and control something make-believe
So you buy me things you think I like
But nothing ever fits me right
Do you confuse me with somebody 'cause
I'm just not that type

She must've hurt you so bad
Can't seem to let her go
'Cause even though you could be holding me
I know you would rather be with her
That girl must be amazing
Stops you from moving on
No matter how many times I try and try to tell you
How this makes me feel

You might be thinkin', thinkin'
Maybe, maybe I'm just like that girl
Ooh
And just because I'm with you doesn't mean that
I should be that girl
Oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah [repeat]

I gotta tell you make me crazy, crazy
The way that you try to change me how

You expect me talking, acting doing things that ain't me
When you decide you're ready to love me just for who I am then maybe
Maybe I can think about it (think about it)

She must've hurt you so bad
Can't seem to let her go
'Cause even though you could be holding me
I know you would rather be with her
That girl must be amazing
Stops you from moving on
No matter how many times I try and try to tell you
How this makes me feel

(Chrous)
You might be thinkin', thinkin'
Maybe, maybe I'm just like that girl
Ooh
And just because I'm with you doesn't mean that
I should be that girl
Ooh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah [repeat]

You might be thinkin', thinkin' maybe, maybe I should be that girl oh
And just because I'm with you... I should be that girl [high note]

(Chrous)
You might be thinkin', thinkin'
Maybe' maybe I'm just like that girl
Ooh
And just because I'm with you doesn't mean that
I should be that girl
Ooh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah [repeat]
