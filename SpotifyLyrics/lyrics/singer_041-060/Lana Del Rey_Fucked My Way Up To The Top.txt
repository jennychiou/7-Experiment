Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I passed, yes

Lay me down tonight
In my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight
Riviera girls

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go

Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show (babe)

I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me is a fucking bore
To me, but babe

Lay me down tonight
In my diamonds and pearls
Tell me something nice
'Bout your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go

Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you baby, more, more, more, more
Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Fucking need you baby, more, more, more, more

Lay me down tonight
In my linen and pearls
Lay me down tonight
I'm your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go

Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
I need you baby, more, more, more, more
Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
