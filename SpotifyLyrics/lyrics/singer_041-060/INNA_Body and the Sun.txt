We were sexy
We were bad
We were everything
Everyone wished they had

We were crazy
We were good
We did everything
That others wished they could

We were falling
When the skies were blue
It's a shame
How winter came too soon

Tried to love you
But the love falls too
Should we let it go
Let it go, let it go

I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
All the things that we've done
Oh, I miss your body and the sun

I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
We were nothing but fun
Oh, I miss your body and the sun

Ain't no limits
Ain't no rules
Baby, there ain't no telling
What we can do

We'll get crazy
We'll be cool
We'll do everything
Others wished they could

We were falling
When the skies were blue
It's a shame
How winter came too soon

Tried to love you
But the love falls too
Should we let it go
Let it go, let it go

I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
All the things that we've done
Oh, I miss your body and the sun

I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
We were nothing but fun
Oh, I miss your body and the sun

Oh, I miss your body and the sun

I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
Oh, I miss your body and the sun

Oh, I miss your body and the sun
Oh, I miss your body and the sun
