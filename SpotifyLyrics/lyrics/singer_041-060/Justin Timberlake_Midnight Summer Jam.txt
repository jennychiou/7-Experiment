Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit, wait

It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

It's in the air, hospitality
Anything you want, what's mine is yours
But don't you worry about the way I talk, whoo
It's where I'm from, come and get you some, uh

Hey, all of the locals are happy to get out and meet a new face
We dance in circles, on and on, and dosey-do and then we sway
Even the old folks'll come out and rock
And we just hopin' the music don't stop till the next day

It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the, south ain't the shit

Summer nights, I love those
Summer nights, I love those

Wait, it's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
