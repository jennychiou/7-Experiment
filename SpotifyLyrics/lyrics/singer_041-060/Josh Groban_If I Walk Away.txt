Lately, I've been the quiet one
Waiting searching the lines of the songs you played for me
Sailing into the misty air
Fading bound for I don't know where
When I'm there I'll see

And If I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Please follow me

Weightless drifting through stars I got
Faithless woke in the dark and I made this from my dream
Play me all your sweet rhymes
Recreate me, now comes the time when I'll need your truth to see

And if I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Please follow me

Walk away
Let the fear fall away
Into the fire you've made
Scarlet and gold
Walk away
Head for the light of day
Follow a brighter way
Out of the cold and dark
Down to the one bright spark
Futures that all might start
Someday

So if I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Please follow me

Fragments shells of a long ago lifetime
Faces that once were mine
Thrown down by the sea

If I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Would you please follow me
