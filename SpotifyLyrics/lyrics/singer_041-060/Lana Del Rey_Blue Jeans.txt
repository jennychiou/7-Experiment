'Surf!'

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sort of punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember, baby
I will love you till the end of time

Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like 'no please, stay here, we don't need no money
We can make it all work'
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing but he
Was chasing paper
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember, baby
I will love you till the end of time

You went out every night
And baby that's all right
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause I'mma ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit at least you tried
But when you walked out that door a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more, but that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember, oh baby
I will love you till the end of time
