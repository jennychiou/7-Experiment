Baby, I, ooh, ooh
Baby, I, ooh, ooh

I can? t help losing faith when you say
That you love me so much as a friend (as a friend)
You don? t know how it hurt to pretend
When I see you make the same mistakes all over again

Baby, I-I-I-I-I
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie
If I told you you? d be better off with someone else

Baby, I-I-I-I-I (Baby, I-I-I-I-I)
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie (I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie)
If I said I never miss you when I? m by myself

So tonight (So tonight)
I will try (I will try)
I will open your eyes
? 'Cause I know that you? d be better off with me instead

Friday night, dressing up, to go out
U turn around, asking me if you look alright
What can I say, you blow me away
I wish you were mine (I wish you were mine)
Maybe you, already found your Mrs Right
Ooh

Baby, I-I-I-I-I
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie
If I said I never miss you when I? m by myself

So tonight (So tonight)
I will try (I will try)
I will open your eyes
? 'Cause I know that you? d be better off with me instead

So here I am without my armor
You can stab me if you want to
But I won? t hold back no more, no no, no no
The truth is that I have always loved you
I? d be a liar if I don? t tell you
Ooh

Baby, I-I-I-I-I (Baby, I-I-I-I-I)
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie (I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie)

Baby, I-I-I-I-I
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie
If I said I never miss you when I? m by myself

So tonight (So tonight)
I will try (I will try)
I will open your eyes
? 'Cause I know that you? d be better off with me instead

Ooh, baby, I-I-I-I-I
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie
? 'Cause I know that you? d be better off with me instead

Baby I, ooh, ooh
