I know you've been scared
Let me hold you
Girl, lay right there
Close to me
Take me for me
Trust me
Baby
From the stone I stand
Hold on to me

When all the light's gone
I'll be, I'll be fighting for you and me
And all the hope's gone
You'll see I'll be there

When you're fallin'
You know I'll be there for you
Just take my hand
Hold on I'll be there
I'll be your parachute
Falling down down down
I'll be your parachute
Before you fall down down
I'll catch you

So cold up here
Let me hold you
No need to fear
Just fly with me
When all the light's gone
I'll be, I'll be fighting for you and me
And all the hope's gone
You'll see I'll be there

When you're fallin'
You know I'll be there for you
Just take my hand
Hold on I'll be there
I'll be your parachute
Falling down down down
I'll be your parachute
Before you fall down down
I'll catch you

When the rain falls down
Yeah
When the rain falls down
I catch you
When the rain falls down
Under my parachute
Baby girl don't you know

When you're fallin' down
You know I'll be there for you
Just take my hand
You know I'll be
You know I'll be your parachute
Falling down down down
I'll be your parachute
Before you fall down down
I'll catch you
