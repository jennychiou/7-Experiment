Yeah, what's up girl

I eat your words like sugarcoated candy
And they go down down down

I cannot fight this magical connection
Spin me 'round 'round 'round

You should know, I don't throw 'round
Words like this to steal a kiss

Oh can't you see

How to explain, it's not a game
Yeah what I say, it ain't to play
You got me, you got me

Sweet, sweet talk, sweet talk (talk, talk, talk)
Don't let it go to waste
You, you and me, it's real
I know you love the taste

Of my sweet talk, sweet talk
Is the sugar that you need
Yeah my sweet talk, sweet talk (talk, talk)
Is the sugar that you need

Do you feel the beat when I kiss you
It's like a symphony

And you're the one who's
Playing with my heart strings
I sing your melody

You got me hooked with just one look
I swear you'll be the death of me

Girl can't you see

I'm in so deep, I cannot keep
My head this time, you should be mine whoa

Give me it all
All the honey I can handle
I want it all
Cause just a drop, makes my heart pop

Sweet, sweet talk, sweet talk (talk, talk, talk)
Don't let it go to waste
You, you and me, it's real
I know you love the taste

Of my sweet talk, sweet talk
Is the sugar that you need
Yeah my sweet talk, sweet talk (talk, talk)
Is the sugar that you need

Your smile is like molasses
I can barely stand it
How do you get me so damn hooked like that
Or is this how you planned it

I feel like a running rabbit
I just got to have it
When you don't say my name like that
I go into a panic
