Still water runs deep
Why'd you always hide from me?
How do you keep
All your troubles underneath?

Emotion is a wild thing
I'm trying not to feel it
We get on, yeah, somehow we get by
We're alright 'cause

Love runs deep
Deeper than the darkest sea
So drop your guard
Why'd you have to be so hard?

Those paper dolls
Hold each other by the hand
One cut and they break
I'm trying to make you understand

Emotion is a wild thing
Together we can tame it
Look again, don't you realise?
It's in my eyes

Love runs deep
Deeper than the darkest sea
So drop your guard
Why'd you have to be so hard?

I wasn't asking you to open up, to open up
It's not my business anyway
It's just that when you're hurting
It's like I'm always searching
For the right words to say

We have an unspoken rule
That you're always so cruel
Maybe I'm wrong to believe
But in my dreams

Our love runs deep
Deeper than the darkest sea
So drop your guard
Why'd you have to be so hard?

Our love runs deep
Deeper than the darkest sea
So drop your guard
Why'd you have to be so hard?
