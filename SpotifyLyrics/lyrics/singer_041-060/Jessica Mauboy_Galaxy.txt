Not sure how I survived
Before I left this night
Before I came alive I was lost
I felt you pulling me, harder than gravity
Harder than anything I know

So in love with you,
There's nothing I won't do
I'll travel at the speed of light
So I can be right by your side
You make me feel like the whole world isn't real,
And I'm the only star in the sky, sky, sky

Ey, there's no time or space
Everything just melts away when I'm lying here
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I rather be when I'm lying here
In your galaxy
Oh, oh, oh, oh. oh
In your galaxy

With you is my eternity
No place I rather be when I'm lying here
In your galaxy

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Like a comet to my heart
You illuminate that dark
Show me all the parts of me I've never seen
We come from different places, different constellations
When I'm with you I'm home, I'm home

You make it feel like the whole world isn't real,
And I'm the only star in the sky

Ey, there's no time or space
Everything just melts away when I'm lying here
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I rather be when I'm lying here
In your galaxy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I rather be when I'm lying here
In your galaxy

You healed every heartbreak
Took me on a journey
To a place so high
Way above the clouds
Don't matter where we go,
As long as I'm in your world
I never wanna be any place
Yeah

Ey, there's no time or space
Everything just melts away when I'm lying here
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I rather be when I'm lying here
In your galaxy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I rather be when I'm lying here
In your galaxy
