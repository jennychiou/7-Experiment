No more talk of darkness, forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you, my words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom, let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you, to guard you and to guide you

Say you'll love me every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter, let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you, your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom, a world with no more night
And you always beside me, to hold me and to hide me

Then, say you'll share with me one life, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here beside you
Anywhere you go let me go too
Love me, that's all I ask of you

Stay each day with me, each night, each morning
Say you love me, you know I do
Love me, that's all I ask of you
