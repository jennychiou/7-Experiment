It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like puttin' fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worried 'bout
Ooh you know females
And how they like to run they mouths
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood (don't change your mood)

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, sometimes be your best friend
Perfect - ain't saying that I am
Proven, least I'm provin' that I give a damn
Wanna be, wanna be everything I outta be to you, to you
Envy, envy
Same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad
(I ain't all bad)
(I ain't all bad)
