No, no, no, no
No, no, no fire, no fire, I
I wanna feel the music higher
And touch the sky

Don't love the world
You drive me crazy
You're crazy, boy
I wanna live with you
A deja vu

I don't wanna lie
I'm feeling so blue
So take me away
So take me with you

Hey, mystery boy
I'm falling for you
I'm leaving tonight
The last deja vu

No, no, no, no
No, no, no fire, no fire, I
I wanna feel the music higher
And touch the sky

Don't love the world
You drive me crazy
You're crazy, boy
I wanna live with you
A deja vu

I don't wanna lie
I'm feeling so blue
So take me away
So take me with you

Hey, mystery boy
I'm falling for you
I'm leaving tonight
The last deja vu

No, no, no, no
No, no, no fire, no fire, I
I wanna feel the music higher
And touch the sky

Don't love the world
You drive me crazy
You're crazy, boy
I wanna live with you
A deja vu

No, no, no, no
No, no, no fire, no fire, I
I wanna feel the music higher
And touch the sky

Don't love the world
You drive me crazy
You're crazy, boy
I wanna live with you
A deja vu
