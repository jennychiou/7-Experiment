Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything baby

Got laid off at your job today
You've been working at this place for years
And though you were underpaid
Mommy that place isn't worth your tears
(Oh, oh)

I know that life is hard on you
And you can't seem to find out why
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl
And just join me on this ride

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away...

Girl you're the best
You could be
An angel among society
But you get crushed
From what you see
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me
(Woo..)

Try to change what you can
And accept all the things that you cannot
(Don't stress yourself baby)
I know you wanna fly away from the world
But for now with the time we've got

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)

Maybe if you consider us just riding
That once you feel like a winner
No more crying
And baby I know just what you need
(I know)
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yea
(Hair, yea yea yea)

It hurts me to watch you sing the blues
(It hurts me baby)
Girl you're so confused
(Let's get away)
And I know what to do

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
(Let's go, girl)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
(Night)
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)

Let's take a ride
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
(Let's take a ride)
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby (x2)

Let's take a ride
Let's go girl
Let's go girl
Let's go girl
