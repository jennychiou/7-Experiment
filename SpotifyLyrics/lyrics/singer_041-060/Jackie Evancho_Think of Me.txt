Think of me, think of me fondly,
When we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while 
Please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long
To take your heart back and be free 
If you ever find a moment,
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen,
Or as unchanging as the sea 
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things
We've shared and seen -
Don't think about the way things
Which might have been

Think of me, think of me waking,
Silent and resigned.
Imagine me, trying too hard
To push you from my mind.
Recall those days
Look back on all those times,
Think of the things we'll never do 
There will never be a day,
When I won't think of you 

Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons, so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me
