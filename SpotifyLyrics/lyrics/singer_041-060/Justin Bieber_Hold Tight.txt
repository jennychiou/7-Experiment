Happy birthday

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Oh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go

Don’t let this go to your head
But you’re the best, I’ve ever had
Not to mention
That thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance

Something like a zip-loc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh, so hard walking out
You got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, no
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, no

Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don’t know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Oh, when you got me in a gridlock
What a great spot
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won’t stop no
So hard walking out
You got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, oh baby

Holdin' back the faces I would make
I’m a fan and you’re the rock star
Makin' it hard on me
Visualize a monster
'Cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow, I’m hit
Need you right near me
I try to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away (no no)
I try to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight ooh
They hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
