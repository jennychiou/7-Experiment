For all the times I tried for this
And every chance at you I missed
I've been known to go my way, but I confess
It made me miss you more

I drew my line across the sand
And set my flag in no man's land
But here I am the one man band
With a song that's meant for two

And there is a light, from a higher window
Shining down on you tonight
And the music floats on the breeze
Bringing an easier time
And all of our cards are on the table
Tell me what you want to do
Just don't tell me that it's too late
For me to love you

How perfect we were meant to be
Our warm and silent symmetry
It's times like these when all, all we need
Is to be reminded

And I have flown a thousand miles
To empty room and crowded aisles
And we went from cathedral bells
To show and tell and wish you wells
And I, I still look at you and I am blinded I am blinded

Because there is a light, from a higher window
Shining down on us tonight
And the music floats on the breeze
From an easier time

And all of our cards are on the table
Tell me what you want to do
Just don't tell me that it's too late
Don't tell me that it's too late now
Just don't tell me thatit's too late
For me to love you
