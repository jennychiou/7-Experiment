I think we're thinking too hard,
To put on your shoes and get in your car,
Put it in drive and point it this way,
We don't have to talk,
You don't have to stay,

But I ain't got no one sleepin' with me,
And you ain't got no where that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
Till it ain't,
Anymore

We've tried being apart,
But the truth is,
We are who we are,
Were so much alike,
It ain't a good thing,
Too dumb to give up,
Too stubborn to change

But I ain't got no one sleepin' with me,
And you ain't got no where that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
Till it ain't,
Anymore

Till something better comes along,
Till what ever we have is gone

But I ain't got no one sleepin' with me,
And you ain't got no where that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
Till it ain't,
Anymore
Yeah it is what it is,
Till it ain't,
Anymore
