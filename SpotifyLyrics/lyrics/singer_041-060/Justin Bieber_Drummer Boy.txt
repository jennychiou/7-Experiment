Come they told me pa rum pa pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

Yeah, yeah
(I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it)
Yeah, yeah
(I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it)

Rum pa pa pum, rum pa pum pum pum pum
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause I'm playin' for the Son
Playin' for the king, playin for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight, I might go psycho
Christmas time so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know I'm still young but I go I go
Stupid stupid love like cupid
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum
"'Busta Rhymes"'
Gather round the mistletoe real quick
"'Justin"'
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pa pum pum
"'Busta Rhymes"'
Matter of fact, let's gather round the fireplace; it's about to get hot in here
"'Justin"'
That's fit to give our king
"'Busta Rhymes"'
Bieber what up
"'Justin"'
Pa rum pa pum pum, pa rum pum, pa rum pum

Lemme get straight to it. Yo
At the table with the family, havin' dinner
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger
Sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter."
I said, "Cool." Ya know Imma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
"Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! "

Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, pa pum pum, pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe

Globe globe globe globe globe
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
