Here I stand where I begin
Deep in the shadows of my sin
Underneath the hearts of men
I don't think you see me again
Oh oh
Oh oh
Find me frozen in my home
Afraid and I'll be all alone
These walls around me made of stone
And I can't break them on my own
(?)
So sick of trying
I'm waiting for a tidal wave
I think you could save me (?)
So I'm waiting for a tidal wave
Oh oh, oh oh
(?)
So I've been trying to forget
Where I'm from and where I've been
Feel like a stranger in my skin
(?)
So sick of trying
I'm waiting for a tidal wave
I think you could save me (?)
So I'm waiting for a tidal wave
When I see you coming I don't run away
I got my feet on the ground
Everything that's keeping me from who I am meant to be
It all comes tumbling down
(?)
So sick of trying
I'm waiting for a tidal wave
I think you could save me (?)
So I'm waiting for a tidal wave
(?)
So sick of trying
I'm waiting for a tidal wave
I think you could save me (?)
So I'm waiting for a tidal wave
