Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years, we all will be together if the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

Through the years, we all will be together if the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
