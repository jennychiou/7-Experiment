I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy


This dance floor is a jungle
We 'bout to go bananas
Me and my chiquitas
Me and my chiquitas

Don't tell me
'Bout your helicopter
Don't need your bank roll
We got margaritas
We got margaritas

You ain't sayin' nothing
We can do this any time
And we don't need your money
'Cause I'm good at spendin' mine

Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Let's begin

All my girls go
I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy

Too sexy

Too sexy

We settin' it on fire
But we don't need no agua
This is pura vida
This is pura vida

Maybe I'm just a party rocker
This is my anthem
They call me Bonita
They call me Bonita

You ain't sayin' nothing
We can do this any time
And we don't need your money
'Cause I'm good at spendin' mine

Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Let's begin

All my girls go
I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy

Too sexy

Too sexy

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy

All my girls go
Too sexy
Too sexy
