"Hey, what you doing?" Not a lot
Shaking and moving at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why

Lay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Hey, what you thinking? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinking on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me out there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singing with Sean
Whoa

I could keep waiting for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pouring rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came, no, no, no
Tomorrow never came, no, no
Tomorrow never came, no, no, no
Tomorrow never came
