Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait but I can't wait to see you
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad I won't cheat you no more

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me baby

Spotlight, Bad Baby
You've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's ok to shine?

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me baby

Don't be afraid of me, don't be ashamed
Walking away from my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me baby

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you

Grenadine, sunshine, can you break this heart of mine
Darling I'm waiting to greet you, come to me baby
