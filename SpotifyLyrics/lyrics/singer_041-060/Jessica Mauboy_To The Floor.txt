We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn

I feel the music, deep in my body and I can't help it I just loose it
Even when everybody is watching I just
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
So tell the DJ this is my song so keep it going on the replay all night long
So we can show them how to
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out

We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn

So every weekend me and my girls pay at the club
We don't be speakin' we just be out there on the floor
That's when we
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
See we be showin' how poppin' and lockin' moves
They don't even know about, wait for the needle to drop that's when we
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out

We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn
