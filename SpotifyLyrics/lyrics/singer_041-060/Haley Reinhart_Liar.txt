You told me everything I wish I never knew
(Now I can't get past the truth)
Now I just wish I could go back to loving you
(Can't get back to loving you)

There's a right time and a wrong time
Whenever any love goes wrong
But you can't lie so I can't hide
Maybe happiness is blind

I'm not calling you a liar
I just wish you were
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm not calling you a liar)

Please say what you don't know
It can never hurt
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm not calling you a liar)
(I'm not calling you a liar)

You gave me chills not scars
Left me with nothing to hate
(Just a perfect bitter taste)
Wish I was still in the dark
But now I'm burning by the way
(Had to watch you walk away)

There's a right time and a wrong time
Whenever any love goes wrong
But you can't lie, so I can't hide
Maybe happiness is blind

I'm not calling you a liar
I just wish you were
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm not calling you a liar)

Please say what you don't know
It can never hurt
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm not calling you a liar)

I don't want apologies
I don't need your sympathy
Boy, this honesty is killing me
I've learned my lessons well
To let me keep lying to myself
Let me keep lying to myself

I'm not calling you a liar
I just wish you were
I'm not calling you a liar

Please say what you don't know
It can never hurt
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm not calling you a liar)

I'm not calling you a liar
I just wish you were
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm not calling you a liar)

Please say what you don't know
It can never hurt
I'm not calling you a liar
(I'm not calling you a liar)
