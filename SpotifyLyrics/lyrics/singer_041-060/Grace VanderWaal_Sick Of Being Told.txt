I don't wanna be difficult
At all
But let's just try it my way
I mean c'mon

I've showed you countless numbers of times
That I can do it (I can do it)
So for one time in your whole life
Just let me try it (let me try it)

I'm sick of being told
Of what I should know
I just wanna let go
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, woah
Sick of being told
Woah
Sick of being told

What's the harm
To have a little fun?
Been so uptight
I don't need to fight
I'm just, stay and watch

I've showed you countless numbers of times
That I can do it (I can do it)
So for just once in your whole life
Just let me try it (let me try it)

I'm sick of being told
Of what I should know
I just wanna let go
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, woah
Sick of being told
Woah
Sick of being told

I see stars, you just see holes in the sky
You tell me you see it too, but I know that's a lie
I dream in the night just see the darkness of your eyes
I won't let you change me tonight

I'm sick of being told
Of what I should know
I just wanna let go
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, woah
Sick of being told
Woah
Sick of being told

Woah
Sick of being told
Woah
Sick of being told
