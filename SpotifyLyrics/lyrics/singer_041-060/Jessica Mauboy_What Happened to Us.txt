I feel you even though we're apart
And without you there's a hole in my heart
Oh baby, baby
Though I try I just can't adjust
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us, happened to us

We were in love we both felt the same
The good thing that we had, oh boy was the same
We had a bond that would never break
Why'd we let it go
We used to stay up all night long
Kissing to our favourite songs
Tell me where it all went wrong
That's what I got to know

'Cause I feel you even though we're apart
And without you there's a hole in my heart
Oh baby, baby
Though I try I just can't adjust
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us

I thought that I could get over you
Oh but baby that is so far from true
Oh baby baby 
Got something I wanna discuss
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us, happened to us

I think that we ought to work it out
Like air, your love I can't live without
So have mercy, don't leave me in doubt
Say our love still burns
I tried to go my separate way, at first I thought it was okay
I miss you more with each day
So to you I turn

'Cause I feel you even though we're apart
And without you there's a hole in my heart
Oh baby, baby
Though I try I just can't adjust
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us

I thought that I could get over you
Oh but baby that is so far from true
Oh baby baby 
Got something I wanna discuss
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us, happened to us

I know that you saw me with someone else
But believe me I'm all by myself

'Cause I feel you even though we're apart
And without you there's a hole in my heart
Oh baby, baby
Though I try I just can't adjust
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us

I thought that I could get over you
Oh but baby that is so far from true
Oh baby baby 
Got something I wanna discuss
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us, happened to us

Tell me

'Cause I feel you even though we're apart
And without you there's a hole in my heart
Oh baby, baby
Though I try I just can't adjust
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us (what happened to us)
Oh boy what happened to us, happened to us
