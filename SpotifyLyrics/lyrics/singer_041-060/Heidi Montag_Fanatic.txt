Here we, here we, go, go.
Ow, Heidi oh.

Boy you got me checkin',
Feel I got a temperature,
You can be refreshing,
I can be your poster girl.

No need to ask, ask,
I'm on you like a paparazzi,
Flash, Flash.

Got you down cold, cold,
Infatuations where I can charm, charm.

And I want you so bad,
My hands start to sweat,
And whatever this is,
It's gone to my head,

And you got me so wild,
I can't disconnect, it's automatic (automatic... matic).

I'm a fanatic for ya, (I'm a fantatic... atic),
I'm a fanatic for ya, (For you),
I'm a fanatic-c-c-c-c for you (you).

Uh oh Uh oh, Uh oh, Uh oh o-o-o-o-o-o-o.

Boy this is the last thing,
I thought, I would ever do,
Totally obsessing,
I'm zooming for a closer view.

No need to ask, ask,
I'm on you like a paparazzi,
Flash, Flash.

Got you down cold, cold,
Infatuations where I can charm (charm).

And I want you so bad,

My hands start to sweat,
And whatever this is,
It's gone to my head,

And you got me so wild,
I can't disconnect, it's automatic (automatic... matic).

I'm a fanatic for ya, (I'm a fantatic... atic),
I'm a fanatic for ya, (For you),
I'm a fanatic-c-c-c-c for you (you).

Taste it,
Adrenaline,
I feel like I'm so psychotic,
Licking my lips,
It's 3am,
Once I've started, I can't stop.

No need to ask, ask,
I'm on you like a paparazzi,
Flash, Flash.

Yeah...

And I want you so bad,
My hands start to sweat,
And whatever this is,
It's gone to my head,

And you got me so wild,
I can't disconnect, it's automatic (automatic... matic).

I'm a fanatic for ya, (I'm a fantatic... atic),
I'm a fanatic for ya, (For you),
I'm a fanatic-c-c-c-c for you (you).

Oh...
