I'm tired to be lost
Actions speaks louder
Than words
If you feel me

Runaway where you will be
Have more limit to be free
You release me
Take me away

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

I'm tired to be lost
Actions speaks louder
Than words
If you feel me

Runaway where you will be
Have more limit to be free
You release me
Take me away

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
