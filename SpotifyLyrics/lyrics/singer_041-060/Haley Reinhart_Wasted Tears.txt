Left alone I'm not ashamed to say I had to cry
Been lookin' back
I lost my head but I don't know why
Turns out that every night oh I cried
With wasted tears yeah

I can't erase, can't get back another yesterday
If I knew then what I know now, I would've walked away
It's so hard to breath when love's buried alive
Alive, alive

Boy you really made me look a fool
You stole my heart and left it black and blue
But I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying, wasted wasted tears

So take your promises, get on your way
I'm burning memories up in flames
'Cause I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying, wasted wasted tears

I swear the earth,
The universe falling from the sky
You built me up to let me down like a lullaby
I kinda want you to feel what it's like to break, break, break

Boy you really made me look a fool
You stole my heart and left it black and blue
But I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying, wasted wasted tears

So take your promises, get on your way
I'm burning memories up in flames
'Cause I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying, wasted wasted tears

Had me crying,
You were lyin'
I was dyin'
Well that's not love, that's not love
Had me cryin', cryin'
You were lyin', lyin'
I was dyin', dyin'
Well that's not love, that's not love

Boy you really made me look a fool
You stole my heart and left it black and blue
But I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying, wasted wasted tears

So take your promises, get on your way
I'm burning memories up in flames
'Cause I can see now that the clouds are clear
I've been crying, wasted wasted tears

Turns out that every night, oh
I cried with wasted tears
