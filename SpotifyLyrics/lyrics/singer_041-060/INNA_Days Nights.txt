How could I breathe
What can I do to you
To know I feel the same
I keep your name
In my heart.

Why does my heart feel so
Why do I let you go
I can't feel no more
Dream no more
I miss you.

Nights and days
(I can give you)

I just say I'm sorry
I just need you, come home
'Cause I'm crying alone
When you're gone.

I just say I'm sorry
Cause the days become nights
And the nights become days
Without you.

Nights and days
(I can give you)

I just say I'm sorry
I just need you, come home
'Cause I'm crying alone
When you're gone.
I just say I'm sorry
Cause the days become nights
And the nights become days
Without you.

Nights and days
