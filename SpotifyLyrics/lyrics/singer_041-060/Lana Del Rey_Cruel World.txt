Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
Did what I had to do
'Cause it's so far past me now

Shared my body and my life with you
That's way over now
There's not more I can do
You're so famous now

Got your bible, got your gun
And you like to party and have fun
And I like my candy and your women
I'm finally happy now that you're gone

With my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm the best, I'm crazy
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Get a little bit suburban and go crazy

Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, you're crazy for me

I shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I found another anyhow

Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I could see you leaving now

I got your bible and your gun
And you love to party and have fun
And I love your women and all of your heroin
And I'm so happy now that you're gone

Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy, yeah
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Go a little bit suburban and go crazy, yeah

Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, you're crazy for me

Got your bible and your gun
You like your women and you like fun
I like my candy and your heroin
And I'm so happy, so happy now you're gone

Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy, yeah
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Get a little bit suburban and go crazy, yeah yeah

'Cause you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, you're crazy for me

Oh, oh
You're crazy for me
Oh, oh
You're crazy for me
