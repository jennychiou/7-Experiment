My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand 
And he grabs me, he has me, by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a LA crass
Way about me, he loves me, with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool glimmering, darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you sittin', sippin' on your black cristal, yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers 
Chasin' me all over town 'cause he knows I'm wasted 
Facin' time again on Rikers Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy baby, 
I need you to come here and save me 
I'm your little scarlet, starlet, singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul 
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life 
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like
About me, admires me, the way I roll like a rolling stone

He likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup 
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes 
Says it feels like heaven to him 

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers 
Chasin' me all over town 'cause he knows I'm wasted 
Facin' time again on Rikers Island and I won't get out 
Because I'm crazy baby, I need you to come here and save me 
I'm your little scarlet, starlet, singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

Yo I'm off to the races, laces,
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down 
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement, love you but I'm going down
God I'm so crazy baby, I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving 
I'm your little harlot, starlet, queen of Coney Island 
Raisin' hell all over town 
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief and I'm gonna stay and pray with him till the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him 
Who else is going to put up with me this way? 
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you 
They would rue the day I was alone without you

You're lyin' with your gold chain on 
Cigar hangin' from your lips 
I said, "Hun, you never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man".
And we're off to the races, places 
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're going in 
To Las Vegas, chaos, casino oasis
Honey it is time to spin 
Boy you're so crazy baby 
I love you forever, not maybe 
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
