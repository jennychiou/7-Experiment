Midnight
I'm not feeling
So strong now
I'm not ready
To give up on you

My song hurts
Maybe I'm playing it wrong, now

Cold eyes
And everything is fading
And though I'm blinded
Now my eyes can see

Your love, baby
Doesn't love to love me
Love me

Tonight
Oh, baby say my name
Tonight
I want you to remember
Our love
Burning like a flame forever
Summer in December

My sky used to be golden
But you paint it
Into shades of grey
Slow down, baby
I'm already broken

Blue eyes
And everything is fading
This time will never be
The same again
It feels like
My heart is no longer beating
Beating

Tonight
Oh, baby say my name
Tonight
I want you to remember
Our love
Burning like a flame forever
Summer in December

Summer in December
Summer in December

Summer in December
Summer in December

Summer in December
