(Pharrell)
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine

(Justin)
Yes, yes I am

(Pharrell)
And he goes by the name...
Justin
Wowoowoooo

All the way
From Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all
About this girl

(Justin)
Come in right here?

(Pharrell)
Yeah, come on

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mama listen

Señorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

Running fast in my mind
Girl won't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should RIDE!
But you still deserve a crown
Well hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen

Señorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry

Señorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Whoa)
Ah, ah, arms...
(My baby)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Ooh, yeah)
Ah, ah, arms...

Now listen
I wanna try some right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing something
And I want the guys to sing with me
They go
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go
"I don't know, but I'm thinking 'bout really leaving with you."

Guys sing
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies
I don't know, but I'm thinking bout really leaving with you.
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Yeah, ladies
I don't know, but I'm thinking bout really leaving with you.
Sure feels good to me

Sing it one more time
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know, but I'm thinking bout really leaving with you.
Yeah, yeah...
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know what I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you

Gentlemen, good night
Ladies, good morning
(Laughs)
...And that's it
