You said "I come in peace", so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend, please listen to me

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Uh, greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world, I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taken over this planet since I've arrived
I'm in the backpack, I'm ducking Men In Black
Yeah I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gon' name this planet after me
Wayne's world (wayne's world, wayne's world)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

On our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted, it's a gift from the mother
In, in your planet you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
