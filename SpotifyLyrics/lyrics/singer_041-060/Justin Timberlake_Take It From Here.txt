Sometimes, sometimes the world gets hard
Oh na na na
I'm gonna take it from here girl
Don't you worry

I wanna be your lake, or your bay
And any problems that you have
I wanna wash 'em away
I wanna be your sky
So blue and high
And every time you think of me
I wanna blow your mind

I wanna be your air
So sweet and fair
So when you feel that you can't breathe
Ma, I'll be there

I wanna be your answer, all the time
When you see how I put your life before mine
With no question

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

I wanna hold your hands
Reveal all your plans
I wanna make sure every one of your dreams is there
I would be your broadway show on review (why)
So I can act out how God was when he made you
I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost
I'll light a bright and shiny path to help you across (light the way for you
Baby)
I wanna be your mother... wait
See what I see
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me
'Cause I love you

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl (no no)
I'ma take it from here

And when there's no one there to hold
And you realize the world is cold
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
(That's what I'm gonna do)
That's what I'm gonna do
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
(Don't you worry, baby)
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away speeding
Through the Garden of Eden
Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

Give me one reason
Why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving
The time is now
Lets fly away speeding
(We'll fly away)
Through the Garden of Eden
Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

(Got something to tell you baby)
Love ain't always the way they write in books
(No, no)
See there's the good guys
And also heartbreak crooks
Your hearts the real one
Just take a look inside
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide

So there you go
Don't worry
To help you weather the storm
I'll be there mami
No matter what time
No matter what place
You can always count on me
I'll take it from here
