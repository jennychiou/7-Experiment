I'm not as perfect
As I know I can be
I've been deserted
I've been cast out to sea

What can you do
When the world seems to be laughing at you
What can you do
When the world is looking down on you

It's a long way down
When you're headed for the bottom
And I can see it now
I just had to hit the ground

From the ashes I rise
I'm coming back alive
Like a phoenix I'm just waiting to die
I'll be a halo in the sky
I'm learning how to fly
Like a phoenix I'm just waiting to die
Waiting to die

I can't lift my head up
It's like I'm dying inside
I'm dying inside
And I'm so scared

Maybe I'm such a loser
I'm pullin' it out
Pullin' it out my hair

What's a girl to do
When her reflection is the ugly truth
What's a girl to do
When her song is someone elses tattoo

It's a long way down
When you're headed for the bottom
And I can see it now
I just had to hit the ground

From the ashes I rise
I'm coming back alive
Like a phoenix I'm just waiting to die
I'll be a halo in the sky
I'm learning how to fly
Like a phoenix I'm just waiting to die
Waiting to die

Standing on the edge
Looking towards the sun
If I let go
I know I can be beautiful

Standing on the edge
Looking towards the sun
If I let go
I know I can be beautiful

From the ashes I rise
I'm coming back alive
Like a phoenix I'm just waiting to die
I'll be a halo in the sky
I'm learning how to fly
Like a phoenix I'm just waiting to die
Waiting to die

I'm just waiting to die
I'm just waiting to die
