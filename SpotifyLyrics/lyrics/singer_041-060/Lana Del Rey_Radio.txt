Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I'll be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead

I don't even notice how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I've finally found you
Oh, sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em till I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

I don't even notice what life was like
Now I'm in LA and it's paradise
I finally found you
Oh, sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
I've finally found you
Oh, sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Oh, sing it to me

Like a fucking dream I'm living in
