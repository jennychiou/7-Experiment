Tap your foot and watch the clock
I tried to look excited when you walked inside the door
But it was all for sure
I need to get it all out of my mind
Just blast some music and close my eyes
Mmm oh, got me singing like woah-oh-oh-oh

Turn it up and I'll sing it loud
And just shut the world out
See the colors
Feel it in my bones
It goes, oh-oh-oh

Spin the record, oh darling
Inside of my mind
And let's just go-go-go
And lose track of time
Here we go, on this crazy ride
Here we go, in this crazy life
And oh-oh
'Cause, 'cause don't you know?
We're all a little insane sometimes

Louder and louder with every thought
Shaking the floors until the pictures fall off the walls
The walls

So we'll, turn it up and I'll sing it loud
And just shut the world out
See the colors
Feel it in my bones
It goes, oh-oh

Spin the record, oh darling
Inside of my mind
And let's just go-go-go
And lose track of time
Here we go, on this crazy ride
Here we go, in this crazy life
And oh-oh
'Cause, 'cause don't you know?
We're all a little insane sometimes

Don't you know?
We're all a little insane sometimes

Spin the record, oh darling
Inside of my mind
And let's just go-go-go
And lose track of time
Here we go, on this crazy ride
Here we go, in this crazy life
And oh-oh
'Cause, 'cause don't you know?
We're all a little insane sometimes
