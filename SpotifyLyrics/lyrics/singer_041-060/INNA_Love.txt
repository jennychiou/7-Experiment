Come back and set me free
Now from infinity
Love is a mystery
Distance is killing me

Come back, I need you now
You are the love I found
I feel above the ground
You'll take me round and round

Am I, am I dreaming
What I feel tonight
About you and I

Am I, am I dreaming
I can feel your love
When I hold you tight

I just wanna love you
And you're the one
I need you
And I just wanna give
All my love I have

With my lips, I'm feeling
And when I say I mean it
'Cause you're the only one
That I feel tonight

You'll take me round and round
(Don't wanna be)

Come back and set me free
Now from infinity
Love is a mystery
Distance is killing me

Come back, I need you now
You are the love I found
I feel above the ground
You'll take me round and round

You'll take me round and round
You'll take me round and round

(Don't wanna be)
Go
(Don't wanna be)

Come back and set me free
Now from infinity
Love is a mystery
Distance is killing me

Come back, I need you now
You are the love I found
I feel above the ground
You'll take me round and round

(Don't wanna be)
(Don't wanna be)

Come back and set me free
Now from infinity
Love is a mystery
Distance is killing me

Come back, I need you now
You are the love I found
I feel above the ground
You'll take me round and round
