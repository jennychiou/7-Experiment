Oh my god
You got your head in the clouds, never come down
I love that you're a crazy ride
The way you let down your hair like you don't care
You rock this steady world of mine, one of a kind
I guess that opposites they attract
My Jordan's they could run for miles to see your smile
And girl you got me going so fast

Cause oh, oh my god
Girl I love this crazy life
And it's you, yeah it's you
You keep my engine running
And oh, all those nights
You and me, what a crazy ride
And it's you, yeah it's you
You keep my engine running

You keep my engine running

Oh my god
This girl is all that I see, now listen to me
Oh yeah you got it
That's so hot
The way you dance on the street, you take the lead
You rock this steady world of mine, one of a kind
I guess that opposites they attract
My Jordan's they could run for miles to see your smile
And girl you got me going so fast

Cause oh, oh my god
Girl I love this crazy life
And it's you, yeah it's you
You keep my engine running
And oh, all those nights
You and me, what a crazy ride
And it's you, yeah it's you
You keep my engine running

You keep my engine running

You know with you I don't, I don't need no one else
It's incredible, unstoppable
And you know me like I know, I know myself
It's magical, don't you know that
I would do do do do anything
We can love love love like we've never been hurt
Like we've never loved before, yeah

You keep my engine running, engine running
You keep my engine running
You keep my engine running

I know you've got it
I know you've got it
Yeah, you got me going so fast
You keep my engine running
