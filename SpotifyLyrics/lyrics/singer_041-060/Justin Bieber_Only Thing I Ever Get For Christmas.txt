If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true
You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

I know someone out there knows what I'm saying (oh no)
Maybe you're a girl who's wishing just like me (yeah, yeah)
There is one in you, know who you are
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holidays and hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true
You're the single line up on my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

In the morning I know everybody's rushing
To see what's underneath their Christmas tree
Know what I mean 'cause I won't find it there
Underneath the mistletoe is where
You make my holidays, so hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true (everything I've wished for, yeah yeah)
You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

Me there, me there, yeah
Only you can make this a Merry Merry Christmas

There is one and you know who you are all I have to give is my heart
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true
You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

All I ever wanted was you, this Christmas
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I need you baby

You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, kiss me there

I'll be waiting, kiss me there
