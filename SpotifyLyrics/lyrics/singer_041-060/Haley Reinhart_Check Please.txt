I watch you look at your reflection
Off the knife you're so pretentious
How do you look, my love?

A silly boy with a porcelain smile
It was fun just for a while
How do you look, my love?

As I'm running for the door
I gotta say

Hey!
I thought you were the one
But this happiness is gone
Wish I could bite my tongue
You never get me

I can't just play along
What was sweet is now so wrong
Watching the tables turn
I'll take the check please

Ooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Ooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Ooh, I gotta get out now
Gotta get out now

Our future's looking grim now
See the lights are getting dimp now
How do we look, my love?

Ooh, I've got too much on my plate now
And I need some stimulation
How do we look, my love?

As I'm running for the door
I gotta say

Hey!
I thought you were the one
But this happiness is gone
Wish I could bite my tongue
You never get me

I can't just play along
What was sweet is now so wrong
Watching the tables turn
I'll take the check please

Ooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Ooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Ooh, I gotta get out now
Gotta get out now

Ooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Ooh, I gotta gotta get out now
Ooh, I gotta get out now
Gotta get out now

I bet you don't even know
All the things that you've done, dude
You're being stupid, you're dumb
It's like I don't even know you

I bet you don't even know
All the things that you've done, dude
You're being stupid, you're dumb
It's like I don't even know you
As I'm running for the door
I gotta say
Hey!
I thought you were the one
But this happiness is gone
Wish I could bite my tongue
You never get me
I can't just play along
What was sweet is now so wrong
Watching the tables turn
I'll take the check please.
