Echoes start as a cross in you
Trembling noises that come to soon
Spatial movement which seems to you
Resonating your mask or feud
Hollow talking and hollow girl
Force it up from the root of pain

Never said it was good, never said it was near
Shadow rises and you are here

And then you cut
You cut it out
And everything
Goes back to the beginning

Silence seizes a cluttered room
Light is shed not a breath too soon
Darkness rises in all you do
Standing and drawn across the room
Spatial movements are butterflies
Shadows scatter without a fire

There's never been bad, there has always been truth
Muted whisper of the things she'll move

And then you cut
You cut it out
And everything
Goes back to the beginning

There's never been bad, there has always been truth
Muted whisper of the things she'll move
