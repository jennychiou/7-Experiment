Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were being chased around
Saw you being cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all, said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator
Turn me on when you need electricity

Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby
We'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplies
Supplies
I got you, I got supplies
Supplies

I don't know if you 'member this, but I was out of town
Flew in on a 3:00 AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way, I can guarantee you that
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator
Turn me on when you need electricity

Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby
We'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplies
Supplies
I got you, I got supplies
Supplies

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl, okay
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl, okay

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator
Turn me on when you need electricity

Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby
We'll be living in The Walking Dead

Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover

Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

'Cause I got supplies
Supplies
I got you, I got supplies
