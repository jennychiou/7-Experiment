One, Two, Three, For

Met you in the water, oh, oh
Swimming in the shadow
Of my heart
Went a little deeper, oh, oh
I knew that we were perfect
From the start

Oh baby, me and you
We're gonna have
A little rendez vous
We're gonna keep it
A ménage à deux
The way you loved me
Gave me déjà vu

When I get the feeling
Real in the summer
You can come and meet me
We can fall in love

Take me to the sea
Take me to the sun
Just a little secret
No one needs to know

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

Temperature is rising, oh, oh
You're the only one
To cool me down
You're my hidden treasure
On the shore
You know you're the best thing
That I've found

Oh baby, me and you
We're gonna have
A little rendez vous
We're gonna keep it
A ménage à deux
The way you loved me
Gave me déjà vu

When I get the feeling
Real in the summer
You can come and meet me
We can fall in love

Take me to the sea
Take me to the sun
Just a little secret
No one needs to know

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

I hear your body
I hear it calling
I move to the rhythm of you
'Cause you know exactly what to do

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

When I get the feeling
When I get the feeling
When I get the feeling
When I get the feeling

No one needs to know
Oh, rendez vous
