The first Noel
The angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked, they looked up
And they saw a star
Shining in the east
Beyond them far

And to the earth it gave great light
So it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King, born is the King, born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King, born is the King, born is the King of Israel
Of Israel, Israel, of Israel

Born is the King of Israel
