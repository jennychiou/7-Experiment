Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

We're in the corner of the crowded room
I want you lips, your body, boy, how soon?
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night
This might just be the night of you and I,
If there is no distancee, no hearts tonight,
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.

Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.

Ain't looking for someone to call my own,
But with you boy we're in danger zone,

And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.
So here we are, I just dream of you
And all the thing that I'm about to do to you,
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.

Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.

Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
