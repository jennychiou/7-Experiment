Oh I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up, shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't never gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't never gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you're too good for us, you'll be good riding solo

Yeah I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't never gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
High horse
You ain't never gonna come down
You ain't never gonna come down
