Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains:

Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee


Christ the Lord, the newborn King

Gloria (let us sing)
In excelsis Deo (in excelsis Deo)
Gloria in excelsis Deo

Gloria (Angels, we have heard on high, sweetly singing)
In excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo-oria in excelsis Deo
Excelsis Deo
