A single rose, the card he chose the fact that I can't get it off my mind
I'm feeling weak, I try to breathe,
But something inside that I can't define is all a sign that I've crossed the line,

As I lose control, to this precious place,
I'm falling in love again,
In love again, in love again,

The softest touch, it says so much,
And all of a sudden, I start to shake,
And I begin to let him in, all the while so scared,
My heart will break and I might make the same mistakes,

As I lose control, to this precious place,
I'm falling in love again,
Oh but I can't let go, all cause I'm so afraid,
Of falling in love falling in love again,

I wanna remember there was a time when love was all that I had in me,
I wanna unlearn all that hurt that still burns on second-hand memories,
I'm tired of this loneliness so cold and scared to death,
I'll never be ready,

As I lose control, to this precious place,
I'm falling in love again,
Oh and I can't let go, all cause I'm so afraid,
Of falling in love again,
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again,
In love again
