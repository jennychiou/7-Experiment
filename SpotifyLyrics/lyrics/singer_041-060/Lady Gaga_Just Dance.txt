How does he twist the dance, can't find my drink, oh man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone (Oh oh oh-oh)

What's goin' on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore (Whoo!)
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance, gonna be okay, da dat doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, spin that record, babe, da dat doo-doo-mmm

Dance, dance, dance, just, j-j-just dance

Control your poison babe, roses have thorns they say
And we're all getting hosed tonight (Oh oh oh-oh)

The way you're twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And now there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay and let me watch you break it down and
