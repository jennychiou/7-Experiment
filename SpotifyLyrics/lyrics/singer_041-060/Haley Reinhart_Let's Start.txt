Bah ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah

I feel so lost until you're near me
You take me places that I never knew existed, yeah
Now I need it (now I need it)
All the time now, baby (all the time)
And I don't mind if (and I don't mind)
If I go a little crazy (woo)

Bah ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah

Bah ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah

I'm drowning in your love completely
So deeply, dear, in seas of blue and green at rapid speed
Carry me swiftly (carry me swiftly)
Up to the mountain, baby (to the mountain)
To see us at our peak (at our peak)
Just don't forget to breathe, ah

Bah ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah

Bah ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah
Ba ba ba bah, ba ba ba bah

Let's start to take it up again
Let's start making love again
Let's start like it never ends
Let's start, let's start
