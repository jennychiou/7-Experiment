Girl I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you love me
We let it straight for a while, yeah
But you deceived me, you convinced me yeah

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

'Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

I felt victim to your style
It's so amazing, girl you're in your only
Rather be stuck in the night, yeah
Than tryna be without you girl

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

'Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you
