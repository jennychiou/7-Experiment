Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
I got my cup filled up on the way to the brim brim brim brim
Black on black Cadillac with the custom trim trim trim trim
Smoke fillin' up my lungs and I'm blowin' bubble bubble bubble bubble
It's Saturday night let's get in trouble trouble trouble trouble

So it's about to go down
Me and my girls 'bout to run this town
So where we're planning to go don't matter
'Cause we gonna take control
Now we got their hair done
Got the pink and whites
And we're off gonna see what the fellas are like
Got the top dropped down on the DB9
Pushing 90 on the freeway so we gonna make good time

Yeah we go ride ride ride on a Saturday night
All the girls they just hatin' because they know that we tight
Gotta get it poppin' 'bout to take the spotlight
So we ride, we ride on a Saturday night
We on fire, we go higher
We ride flyer than you, we ride we ride
We on fire, we go higher
We ride flyer than you, we ride we ride

They gone wear high heel shoes
Me and my girls rockin' Jimmy Choos
They think that binzo's fun
We roll out like we're the girl James Bond
Now we got their hair done
Got the pink and whites
And we're off gonna see what the fellas are like
Got the top dropped down on the DB9
Pushing 90 on the freeway so we gonna make good time

Yeah we go ride ride ride on a Saturday night
All the girls they just hatin' because they know that we tight
Gotta get it poppin' 'bout to take the spotlight
So we ride, we ride on a Saturday night
We on fire, we go higher
We ride flyer than you, we ride we ride
We on fire, we go higher
We ride flyer than you, we ride we ride

We ride we go and we rock we roll
And we pop lock and I drop the top
I hit a switch and the whip go low
And my mission for tonight is just to get into some action
Wake up tomorrow morning and not even know what happened

Yeah we go ride ride ride on a Saturday night
All the girls they just hatin' because they know that we tight
Gotta get it poppin' 'bout to take the spotlight
So we ride, we ride on a Saturday night
We on fire, we go higher
We ride flyer than you, we ride we ride
We on fire, we go higher
We ride flyer than you, we ride we ride
