You just walked in through the door
And you're home late again
Now you're acting strange
And you won't tell me where you've been

You can look me in the eyes
Imagine every alibi
Think you've got it made but boy
There's something you don't know

When you left your room
You shouldn't have forgot your phone
I just heard your messages
And this is where it ends

Been getting away with the [Incomprehensible] so long
Boy you're at the point you don't know right from wrong

You're never gonna change
You're feeling me, you're feeling me
You hear what I'm saying
You're feeling me, you're feeling me

All I know is
No I don't forgive ya, no tears left to cry
The door is shut, I give up, boy I'm empty
Gave you second chances at least a hundred times
You're not the one, I am done in fact you offend me

I'm sick and tired of hearing from my friends that you've been lying
No reasons to stay but to leave, yeah, I got plenty
There's nothing left here for you in this empty heart of mine
You took all the love from the start now it's empty

You're feeling me, you're feeling me
You're feeling me, you're feeling me

You didn't even realize the hole that you're digging
When you try to tell me that she doesn't mean a thing
Suddenly all I can see is what you think of me

And trying to point the finger at me
I can't cope
That you did what you did
'Cause of something I don't

You should be ashamed
You're feeling me, you're feeling me
Trying to shift the blame
You're feeling me, you're feeling me

But all I know is
No I don't forgive ya, no tears left to cry
Door is shut, I give up, boy I'm empty
Gave you second chances at least a hundred times
You're not the one, I am done, in fact you offend me

I'm sick and tired of hearing from my friends that you've been lying
No reasons to stay but to leave, yeah, I got plenty
There's nothing left here for you in this empty heart of mine
You took all the love from the start now it's empty

You're feeling me, you're feeling me
You're feeling me, you're feeling me

And no I don't forgive ya, no tears left to cry
The door is shut, I give up, boy I'm empty
Gave you second chances at least a hundred times
You're not the one, I am done, In fact you offend me

I'm sick and tired of hearing from my friends that you've been lying
No reasons to stay but to leave, yeah, I got plenty
There's nothing left here for you in this empty heart of mine
You took all the love from the start now it's empty

No, no, door is shut, I give up, boy I'm empty
And no you're not the one
I am done in fact you offend me

I'm sick and tired of hearing from my friends that you've been lying
No reasons to stay but to leave, yeah, I got plenty
There's nothing left here for you in this empty heart of mine
You took all the love from the start now it's empty
