The purest eyes and the strongest hands
I love the ground, baby, where you stand
And my will to fight it all disappears
Well, now that you're here

You're everything I've been thirsty for
You're everything that I can't afford
Can't leave you now, I'd be trembling, counting every tear
Well, now that you're here, oh, now that you're here

Feels like this chemistry might be the end of me
If love is my enemy, don't set me free
Now that you're here, there's no one else for me
Energy like where it's taking me
If love is my enemy, don't set me free
Now that you're here, there's no one else for me

I never thought I'd feel so divine
You're like poetry, desire justified
You're a legend now that'll never die
Well, now that you're here

Almost torture now, this insanity
As you captivate every inch of me
You're taking me so far away when you're pulling me near
Well, now that you're here, oh, now that you're here

Feels like this chemistry might be the end of me
If love is my enemy, don't set me free
Now that you're here, there's no one else for me
Energy like where it's taking me
If love is my enemy, don't set me free
Now that you're here, there's no one else for me

Baby, don't leave me alone
Just let me feel this over and over
Pull me in closer and closer
'Cause baby, now that you're here

Stuck on your energy like where it's taking me
If love is my enemy don't set me free
Now that you're here, there's no one else for me
Now that you're here
