Hollywood hills
They got you dreaming
Feeding you pills
Trying to build you
Make you feel better
They'll pay all your bills
Yeah they'll do whatever
Ou ouuu
Guess that's enough for you
Enough for you
Ou ouuu
I'll never fall for you
Never fall for you
It's a bad light
A bad light
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
Bad light
A bad light
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
Hollywood hunnies
With sugar dad moneys
Don't get me started
Plastic fantastic
Seems rather tragic
Go do your eight ball
Isn't it magic
Ou ouuu
Is that enough for you
Enough for you
Ou ouuu
I'll never fall for you
Never fall for you
It's a bad light
A bad light
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
Bad light
A bad light
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
Instrumental solo
Ouu
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
Bad light
A bad light
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
Bad light
A bad light
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
It's a Bad light
A bad light
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
It's a Bad light
A bad light
When you're standing in top
You ain't looking up
When you're standing on top
You ain't looking up
