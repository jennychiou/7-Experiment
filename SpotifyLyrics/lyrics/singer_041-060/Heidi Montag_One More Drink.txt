(I might be yours tonight)
I see you lookin' at me in the club
You been waitin' to come and show me love
I'm passed my limit, he's lookin' good, must admit it
Happy juice up in my system, let's keep it hot bartender
His hands upon my waist, so close that I can't wait
I'm going home with you, if I have one more drink

One more drink then I'll be, then I'll be in love (one drink)
Then I'll be in love, yeah (you may get lucky)
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be in love, yeah
(Baby)
One more drink then I'll be, then I'll be in love
Then I'll be in love, yeah
(I'll be yours tonight)
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be in love, yeah

I'm getting lost in this liquid high
I'm elevated to some new heights
You got me doin' things I never do
Sippin' on that happy juice
It's all because of you

I'm passed my limit, I think I like it
Goose up in my system, I'm drunk under the stars so keep on
His hands upon my waist, so close that I can't wait
I'm going home with you, if I have one more drink

One more drink then I'll be, then I'll be in love (one more drink)
Then I'll be in love, yeah
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be in love, yeah
One more drink then I'll be, then I'll be in love (you might get lucky, babe)
One more drink then I'll be, then I'll be in love (you might get lucky, babe)
Then I'll be in love, yeah
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be in love, yeah

When I start the alcohol, I'm feelin' clumsy about to fall
You got me love drunk, I don't wanna stop

When I start the alcohol, I'm feelin' clumsy about to fall
You got me love drunk, I don't wanna stop

It's official (can't explain), I'm twisted up (can't complain)
It's conditional (tell me your name), so we can go harder

Come on baby and take me home
You ain't gotta worry baby, I'm grown
I'm sippin' it quick to get you back home alone

One more drink then I'll be, then I'll be in love
Then I'll be in love, yeah
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be in love, yeah
One more drink then I'll be, then I'll be in love
Then I'll be in love, yeah
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be in love, yeah
(One more drink, drink, drink...)
