Wake up
In a dream dream dream
But the air is soft
To breathe breathe breathe

So hold on and don't let go
If you fall down, then you should know
That we can just be

Blowing florets
I want to dance in the air
Blowing florets
And just not care about anyone or anything
But you and me

So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me
Don't let go

And rise up, like the trees trees trees
And let go of all responsibilities
And we can just be

Blowing florets
I wanna dance in the air
Blowing florets
And just not care about anyone or anything
But you and me

So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me
Don't let go

Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go

Oh
Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go

Florets
I wanna dance in the air
Blowing florets
And just not care about anyone or anything
But you and me

So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me
Don't let go of me

Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go

Wherever the wind blows
Ever the wind blows
Don't let go
