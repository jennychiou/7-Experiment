Big world
Please do not swallow us up
Please do not blind our eyes with ocean blue

A young girl
She's got time left to grow up
See the light of hope in her eyes
She gives to you

And now I know
Just what we're fighting for
How long to go
Until we ask for more

And we all might find ourselves
Living below the line
Still living below the line

One world
Strong as the beating of drums
Loud as the voice inside
Is more than enough

Fire
Under the burning red sun
Wake up the heartless sky
And show some love

And now I know
Just what we're fighting for
How long to go
Until we ask for more

And we all might find ourselves
Living below the line
Still living below the line

When I start to feel the night begin to fall
And in the silence hear the heart of it all
Sometimes it's hard to find a way to rise above
But then we find our strength in love

Just what we're fighting for
How long to go
Before we ask for more

And we all might find ourselves
Living below the line
We're all living below the line
We're living below the line
We're living below the line
