Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see him again and again

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear him laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of his laughter will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it, who can tell you why
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel him call you across a crowded room
Then fly to his side and make him your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone

Once you have found him, never let him go
Once you have found him, never let him go
