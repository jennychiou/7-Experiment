Say you love me as much as I love you
Would you hurt me baby?
Could you do that to me yeah?
Would you lie to me baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more

Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?
I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you

That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind

'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop girl

Oh baby, I know lovin' you ain't easy
But it sure is worth a try

Oh if there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard... are there any rules baby?
If this is a lesson, then baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do, just to stay right next to you

I can't help it I'm just selfish, there's no way that
I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me I just
Die in your arms, oh it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop girl

Basically I'm saying here, I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me
Ain't no need for contemplating, promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me baby I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms,
