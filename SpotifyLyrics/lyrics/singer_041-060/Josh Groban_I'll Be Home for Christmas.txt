I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and misltetoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
With a love like me
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams



Choir Sings: I'll be home for Christmas
There'll be snow and mistletoe

Martina Sings: Christmas Eve wil find me
With a love like me
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
