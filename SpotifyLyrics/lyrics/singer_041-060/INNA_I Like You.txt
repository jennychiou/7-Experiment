Oh I, been trough without you
And no one ever find the one I belong to
My heartbeat's racing faster than the speed of light
Won't you tell me that you're with me tonight?

Tonight I wanna hold you tight, babey
I'm burning with a favor hot inside, tell me
I'm falling deeper can you hear my cry
So what I gotta do to make you mine?

Uuh uuuh I think I like you
I know I'll never find another lover like you
Say uuh uuuh I think I like you
My favor I'll be yours I will always stay true

Woooh, woooh, woooh oh oh

Waiting for your love to form me a lifeline
Well something really happens when you're calling my name
Won't you tell me that you feel the same?
