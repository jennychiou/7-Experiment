Did my make-up and my hair the way you like (like), like (like)
Still you seem to find something 'bout me that isn't right (right), right (right)
You called me sexy, when we first began
I'm sorry this is the way I am
I'm crazy just for giving you a chance, chance
This will never happen again

Look what you did to me, cut me so very deep
I need a doctor 'cause this is starting to burn
Try to fix it now; the bridge is to the ground
This love is over, so baby, just let it burn

When we're at the club, gonna shake it the way that turns you on (on)
(You couldn't take your eyes off me) You know that I'm hot
But you wanna make me feel like I did something wrong, wrong
You're twisted if you think that you could control me
Your actions are about to leave you sad and lonely
You're crazy, so let me put this to an end, end
Don't ever want to see you again

Look what you did to me, cut me so very deep
I need a doctor 'cause this is starting to burn
Try to fix it now; the bridge is to the ground
This love is over, so baby, just let it burn

I'm on fire, I'm on fire
No way to cool me down, boy you're burning me up
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
No way to cool me down, boy you're burning me up, oh oh oh oh

Look what you did to me, cut me so very deep
I need a doctor 'cause this is starting to burn
Don't try to fix it now; the bridge is to the ground
This love is over, so baby, just let it burn

Look what you did to me, cut me so very deep
I need a doctor 'cause this is starting to burn
Don't try to fix it now; the bridge is to the ground
This love is over, so baby, just let it burn
