Why? Who, me? Why?

Feet, don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks
Every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on the Friday night
Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Try'na take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die

(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born, we were born to die)
