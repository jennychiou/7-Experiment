I get my confidence from a brand new shirt
I know it doesn't make sense but I swear it works
I've tried to plant flowers just to hide the dirt
And I've tried to find pleasure in disguising the hurt

I dress it up
And you strip it down
Oh, I dress it up
And you strip it down

Darling you uncover me
Darling you see what I don't see
Found my heart like buried treasure at the bottom of the sea
Darling you uncover me

You make me feel like a clown
Stuck out in the rain
With all my paint melting down and falling from my face
Standing naked in front of you
And I don't feel afraid
'Cause you take my pain and make it yours before I could runaway

And I dress it up
Till you strip it down
I dress it up
And you strip it down

Darling you uncover me
Darling you see what I don't see
Found my heart like buried treasure at the bottom of the sea
Darling you uncover me
Uncover me, hm

Now I try to love my flaws 'cause they're better than a perfect lie
Instead of sinking ships I'm sailing on an ocean wide
And I left that shore 'cause I saw you on the other side
You're my lighthouse and you shine out

Darling you uncover me
Darling you see what I don't see
Found my heart like buried treasure ot the bottom of the sea
Darling you uncover me

Oh, you uncover me
Darling you see what I don't see
Found my heart like buried treasure ot the bottom of the sea
Darling you uncover me
