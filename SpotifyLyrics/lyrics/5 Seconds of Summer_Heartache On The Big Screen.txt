Started out like in the movies
But it ended like a bad dream
Curtain opened, heard the crowd roar
This one's a repeat, seen it before

Rewind to the start before it all went wrong
What's going on?

Fast forward to the end, after everyone's gone home
And they've forgotten it all

This ain't a movie that I wanna see
A tragic story, starring you and me
Yell "cut", we're stuck inside this scene
This is heartache on the big screen
The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time
The camera's rolling, and I forgot my lines
My script is ripped and now I see

This is heartache on the big screen
This is heartache on the big screen

Curtain closes on this clich√©
A good story of a bad day
Back to square one, where I started
As I stand here, broken-hearted

Fast forward to the end, after everyone's gone home
And they have forgotten it all

This ain't a movie that I wanna see
A tragic story, starring you and me
Yell "cut", we're stuck inside this scene
This is heartache on the big screen
The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time
The camera's rolling, and I forgot my lines
My script is ripped and now I see

This is heartache on the big screen

If Hollywood could see me now
I'd get the starring role
But they won't so I'll just keep on acting a fool

This ain't a movie that I wanna see
A tragic story, starring you and me
Yell "cut", we're stuck inside this scene
Yeah

The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time
The camera's rolling, and I forgot my lines
My script is ripped and now I see

This is heartache on the big screen
This is heartache on the big screen
This is heartache on the big screen
