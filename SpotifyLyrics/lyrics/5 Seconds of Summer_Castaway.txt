Young love, close the chapter, there's no ever after
Fell fast, ended faster, yeah
Late night conversations, led to complications
Now my heart is in my hands

'Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
And I just keep on asking myself

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway
Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway

All your screaming whispers, slip right through my fingers
But these memories linger on
Eyes closed, all I see is good times disappearing
And I'm trying to hold on

'Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
I just keep on asking myself

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway
Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway

Castaway
Castaway

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway
Heartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
