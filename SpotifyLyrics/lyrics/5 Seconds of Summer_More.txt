If me and you are living in the same place
Why do we feel alone? Feel alone?
A house that's full of everything we wanted
But it's an empty home, empty home

Why can't we choose our emotion?
'Cause we could feel something's broken
And I can't stay without hoping
We'll never be alone, we'll never be alone, oh

And all the things that we dream about
They don't mean what they did before
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
Why does it feel like we're missing out?
Like I'm standing behind the door
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more

'Cause lately we've been living in different nations
Enemy lines are drawn, lines are drawn
We're speaking different tongues communicating
Right through the bedroom wall, bedroom wall

And as we fall, time is frozen
I know we break, but we're not broken
'Cause I can't stay without hoping
We'll never be alone, we'll never be alone, oh

And all the things that we dream about
They don't mean what they did before
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
Why does it feel like we're missing out?
Like I'm standing behind the door
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
And all the things that we dream about
They don't mean what they did before
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
Why does it feel like we're missing out?
Like I'm standing behind the door
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
