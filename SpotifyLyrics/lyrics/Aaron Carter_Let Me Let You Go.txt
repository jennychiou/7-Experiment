Oh, yeah
Baby girl, walk around like it's made of gold, yeah
It's all mine
Oh, yeah
I could take off the handcuffs just to crawl back
I can come right back

You turnin' the tables
When you dance on the table
Trying to talk and you say you're not able, girl
But I am not angry, girl
I know that this is your world
Me, I just live in it, access is limited
But I need to go home

Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you, let me let you go

Let me let you go

But quickly
I know you have something that you could give me
And you know
I lose control so let's move slow

You turnin' the tables
When you dance on the table
Trying to talk and you say you're not able, girl
But I am not angry, girl
I know that this is your world
Me, I just live in it, access is limited
But I need to go home

Let me
Let me
I need to go home
Let me

Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you, let me let you go

Let me let you go

Go!

Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you, let me let you go

Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you go
Let me let you-
Go, go, go, go
