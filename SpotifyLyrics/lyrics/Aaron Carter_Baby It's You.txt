Yeah, c'mon now
(Repeat 6 times)

Too hot
Lookin' fantastic
No lifts or tucks or plastic
The way she works her magic
She's got me like an addict
Ooh, I'm not a dreamer
Fantasize it used to mean that
Gotta move on, gotta play the field
Gotta be strong, no time to kill, so

Check out the girl on the corner of Mason
Lookin' kinda crazy, I'm amazingly dazed yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Woo
Hey, yeah
Check out the way she ties up her laces
Puttin' a smile on their faces
I say hey (hey), ho (ho)

Baby it's you
That I want
So come a little closer, and don't get me wrong
I'm kinda shy
But I know what I want
I'm crazy for you so baby, let's get it on

Yeah c'mon now
(Repeat 4 times)

Too hot
Lookin' like crazy
No if's or but's or maybe's
No time to blind or phase me
Your body activates me
She's throwin' her hair back
And I kinda like that
Gotta move 'cause I like the chase
Gotta move quick, no time to waste, so

Check out the girl on the corner of Mason
Lookin' kinda crazy, I'm amazingly dazed yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Woo
Hey, yeah
Check out the way she ties up her laces
Puttin' a smile on their faces,
I say hey (hey), ho (ho)

Baby it's you
That I want
So come a little closer, and don't get me wrong
I'm kinda shy
But I know what I want
I'm waiting for you so baby, let's get it on

Baby it's you that I want
So come a little closer
And don't get me wrong
I'm kinda shy, but I know what I want
I'm crazy for you, so baby let's get it on

Yeah, c'mon now
Everybody c'mon now
Yeah, c'mon now
Baby, let's get it on now
Yeah, c'mon now
Yeah, c'mon now
All right, here we go
Here we go
