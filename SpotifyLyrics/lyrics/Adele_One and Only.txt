You've been on my mind, I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go, you're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

If I've been on your mind, you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me whichever road I choose, you'll go? 

I don't know why I'm scared, 'cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it, nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it, nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it, nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
