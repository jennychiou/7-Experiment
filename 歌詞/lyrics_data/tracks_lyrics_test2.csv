7,Born in Time,74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX,Bob Dylan,00AlGnzeNVYmilww5OFUw8,"In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You|re comin| thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams.You|re blowing down the shaky street,
You|re hearing my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time.Bridge #1:
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Not this time baby, no more of this,
Takes too much skill, takes too much will,
It|s revealing.
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma,
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reelin| with this feelin|.On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
You won|t get anything you don|t deserve
Where we were born in time.Bridge #2:
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
You hang the flame, you|ll pay the price,
Oh babe, that fire
Is still smokin|.
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain,
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken.In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what|s left of me,
Where we were born in time."

We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife
But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights
Not everything is lavished life
But in the mirror, all I see is all the nights I had to fight
And so I run it, all I had to sacrifice
But now I got the money, I get everything for half the price
DamnYou know Khaled, everybody wants the good life
Ayo, ayo, ayo, nobody really wanna pay the price

Darling, it|s okay to be scared, it|s frightening
At times it just feels like the world is trying hard to knock us down
But there|s a reason that we|re still here when no one else is aroundHow we|ve grown

I|m not a soldier
But you make me wanna be brave
Yeah, you doThrough the depths of despair, we|ve stumbled
And all that distance between us, we|ve crumbled
We|ve ignored all of the rumours and jealous disapprovals
And we|ve come out the other side with something beautifulOh, how we|ve grown

Every day we|re gonna keep on growing
Learning from the tears and the mistakes
We|re not perfect but we|ve come such a long way
As long as I got you by my side
I know what I wanna do in this life
One day when our kids fall in love
We can tell them that the odds were against usI|m not a soldier
