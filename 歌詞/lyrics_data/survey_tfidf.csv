6rUp7v3l8yC4TKxAAR5Bmx,I Hate Everything About You,Three Days Grace,"Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake by
Every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet
Only when I start to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
Only when I start to think about you I know
Only when you start to think about me do you know
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me
I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you"
4FCb4CUbFCMNRkI6lYc1zI,Hero,Mariah Carey,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road 
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt 
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah 
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you"
1UMJ5XcJPmH6ZbIRsCLY5F,Old Flame,Tom Speight,"I saw you starin' at each other
I saw your eyes begin to glow
And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hidin' nothin' that I don't know.
There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.
You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long.
'Cause there's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.
There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longe"
3wF0zyjQ6FKLK4vFxcMojP,Vain,KIRBY,"Something tells me that after I do this
I won't feel the same
It ain't drugs, It ain't lust
But it feels like it's numbing my pain
I've been hurt for so long
I forgot how to love is that strange?
Something tells me you know what I mean
And you feel the same
There ain't no choir
But I hear that angels sing
Holy as water
Falling from heaven's feet
Oh baby there ain't no alter
But I can't help but pray
Baby tell me this feeling
I'm feeling is not in vain
Cause you
You seen inside me
And you
You stood beside me
I ain't easy to love
I won't I won't
Promise I'll change
Something tells me you know what I've been through
And you feel the same
Same, same
And there ain't no choir
But I hear that angels sing
Holy as water
Falling from heaven's feet
Oh baby there ain't no alter
But I can't help but pray
Baby tell me this feeling
I'm feeling is not in vain
Vain, vain baby
Vain, vain, vain
Vain, vain baby"

Another day's been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape

Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away

Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused, but I'm scared
I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow, somewhere

3S0OXQeoh0w6AY8WQVckRW,I'm Yours,Jason Mraz,"Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my best-est
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing 
We are just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't 
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours"
5E5MqaS6eOsbaJibl3YeMZ,Homesick,Dua Lipa,"Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops
Then, darling, what will I do
And I know I go all in
But why do I
You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over
That watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you
You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in

Longing and I'm leaving

That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you"

And I know, that you know that it's me

When the world got you down on your knees

Love you until you're back on your feet
But it's hard when I'm laying my heart in your hands
And you don't hand yours back to me
Just give me something
I don't need to know but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing
Just give me something
I left you flowers outside your door
I see them dyin and it's killing me
Feel like a man on a walking wire
'Cause every change you get you're pushing me
You can break every bone, I'm still standing here
Wait until you can finally see
You know all that we had, it was magic
Now tragically I'm begging you please
Just give me something
I don't need to know but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all

5uCax9HTNlzGybIStD3vDh,Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
Finally it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
5WLSak7DN3LY1K71oWYuoN,I'll Be Good,Jaymes Young,"I thought I saw the devil
This morning
Looking in the mirror, drop of rum on my tongue
With the warning
To help me see myself clearer
I never meant to start a fire
I never meant to make you bleed
I'll be a better man today
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
Yeah, I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the time
That I never could
My past has tasted bitter
For years now
So I wield an iron fist
Grace is just weakness
Or so I've been told
I've been cold, I've been merciless
But the blood on my hands scares me to death
Maybe I'm waking up today
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the light that I shut out
For all of the innocent things that I doubt
For all of the bruises I've caused and the tears
For all of the things that I've done all these years
And all
Yeah, for all of the sparks that I stomped out
For all of the perfect things that I doubt
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world, like I should
Yeah, I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times
I never could, oh, oh-oh

It's not easy making a name for yourself
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far
Let's have fun some and never change that for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone
I sold my soul to the open road (will be the downfall)

Meet me out past the train tracks I'm leavin' and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all
I'm gonna need you to try to follow along
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs
Now go tell them we sold out!
Like we're the ones who changed
I write what I feel, I say what I mean
You can't buy sincerity
I sold my soul to the open road (will be the downfall)

That you found a girl and you're, married now

Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze bound by the surprise
Of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes their memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet
This would taste
Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

There was no help, no help from you

Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been
Thunderstruck
Rode down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules
Played all the fools
Yeah yeah they, they, they blew our minds
And I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please
Yeah them ladies were too kind
You've been
Thunderstruck
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please
Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck
It's alright, we're doin' fine
It's alright, we're doin' fine, fine, fine
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, baby, baby
Thunderstruck, you've been Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck
You've been Thunderstruck"
1ExfPZEiahqhLyajhybFeS,The Lazy Song,Bruno Mars,"Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the TV on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no
I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Tomorrow I'll wake up do some P90x
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out this is great
""Oh my god, this is great""
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops you'll just have to wait
Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo

4RL77hMWUq35NYnPLXBpih,Skinny Love,Birdy,"Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall
I told you to be patient
I told you to be fine
I told you to be balanced
I told you to be kind
In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different ""kind""
I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split
I told you to be patient
I told you to be fine
I told you to be balanced
I told you to be kind
Now all your love is wasted?
Then who the hell was I?
Now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
Come on skinny love
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my"
1pSIQWMFbkJ5XvwgzKfeBv,November Night,Groove Coverage,"You say that you're restless, you say that you know me too well
You've seen all my best and you've heard all the stories I tell
You think you've been taken for granted, you're probably right
Stil I remember a November Night,
When the dawn on your doorway shone white with frost
And the soft love that always began with the touch of your hand
And recall the mornings that tossed your hair in the wind.
Time's made it meaningless, I'm insecure, you can tell
But why am I leaving unless time had only meant well?
There's nothing left now to excite you, no reason to try.
Still I remember a candlelit sky
And the summer surrounding the ground where you and I lay
And though we were always alone with our secrets known,
We both were aware and afraid our closeness might end.
My love's like a dancer, she weaves through the danger complete
Her well rehearsed answers with her rational reasons for feet.
And if it decreases or ceases to always seem right
I'll just remember a November Night
When the dawn on your doorway shone white with frost
And the soft love that always began with the touch of your hand
And recall the mornings that tossed your hair in the wind."
