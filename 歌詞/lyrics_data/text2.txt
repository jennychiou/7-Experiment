I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted\nI thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted\nAnd even though your friends tell me you|re doing fineAre you somewhere feeling lonely even though he|s right beside you?\nWhen he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?\nIf what we had was real, how could you be fine?|Cause I|m not fine at allI remember the day you told me you were leaving\nI remember the make-up running down your face\nAnd the dreams you left behind you didn|t need them\nLike every single wish we ever made\nI wish that I could wake up with amnesia\nAnd forget about the stupid little things\nLike the way it felt to fall asleep next to you\nAnd the memories I never can escape|Cause I|m not fine at allThe pictures that you sent me they|re still living in my phone\nI|ll admit I like to see them, I|ll admit I feel alone\nAnd all my friends keep asking why I|m not aroundIt hurts to know you|re happy, yeah, it hurts that you|ve moved on\nIt|s hard to hear your name when I haven|t seen you in so longIt|s like we never happened, was it just a lie?\nIf what we had was real, how could you be fine?|Cause I|m not fine at allI remember the day you told me you were leaving\nI remember the make-up running down your face\nAnd the dreams you left behind you didn|t need them\nLike every single wish we ever made\nI wish that I could wake up with amnesia\nAnd forget about the stupid little things\nLike the way it felt to fall asleep next to you\nAnd the memories I never can escapeIf today I woke up with you right beside me\nLike all of this was just some twisted dream\nI|d hold you closer than I ever did before\nAnd you|d never slip away\nAnd you|d never hear me sayI remember the day you told me you were leaving\nI remember the make-up running down your face\nAnd the dreams you left behind you didn|t need them\nLike every single wish we ever made\nI wish that I could wake up with amnesia\nAnd forget about the stupid little things\nLike the way it felt to fall asleep next to you\nAnd the memories I never can escape\n|Cause I|m not fine at all\nNo, I|m really not fine at all\nTell me this is just a dream\n|Cause I|m really not fine at all
