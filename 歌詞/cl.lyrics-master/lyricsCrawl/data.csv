"[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Young ambition
Say we'll go slow but we never do
Premonition
See me spendin' every night with you[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you
Oh, don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Dear beloved
Bring those 501s a bit closer, bit closer
And dear, my lover
Do that thing we never do sober, sober[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you (yeah)
Oh, we don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Ariana Grande]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties

"Sweet life livin'
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sitting
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars andThat weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and tryna beI was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?Mansion debut
Love it, do you?
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart, but
She sold it off forThat weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and tryna beI was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?Well, I've got that cigarette smoke
and Saint Laurent coat
But nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like youI was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?Well, I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat
But nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you",troye sivan,Cool,http://www.metrolyrics.com/cool-lyrics-troye-sivan.html
"Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, LordSomebody
Ooh, somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?I work hard
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache in my bones
At the end of the day
I take home my pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, LordSomebody
Ooh, somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?",troye sivan,Somebody To Love,http://www.metrolyrics.com/somebody-to-love-lyrics-troye-sivan.html
