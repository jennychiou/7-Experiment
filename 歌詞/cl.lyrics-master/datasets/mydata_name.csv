"Come on skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here

And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kindAnd in the morning, I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the finesCome on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere

Sullen load is full, so slow on the splitAnd I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kindAnd now all your love is wasted
Then who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your linesWho will love you?

"The weight

I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why

In the war, against yourself

"Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around minePlay it back and press rewind
To when you traced your fingers, drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
Starve my heart of touch and timeSo what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love aroundWhen we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broken
Take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes I still see your ghostSo what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love aroundI don't keep love around, yeah
I don't keep love around, oh-yeah
I don't keep love around
Love around, love aroundThey can't stand, I handstand
I don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda' moved
But that last one was my antidoteGreen eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall flashdance?Only A1, and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
'Cause failure is not pivotalThey just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I'm still sane
Right? Because that's enough?
When the lights on and you don't keep love""Distance makes the heart grow fonder""
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now?
Do now?So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
Love around",troye sivan,DKLA,http://www.metrolyrics.com/dkla-lyrics-troye-sivan.html

Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls

"Growing distance
Free of explanations
We're getting deeper in this mess
Take careful contemplations
I'd rather be spitting blood
Than have this silence fuck me upThis separation
Time and space between us
For some revelation
You didn't even care to discuss
I'd rather be black and blue
Than accept that you withdrewAaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quietUsed to give each other the world
Every bit
I used to be the one you'd come to
When it'd all go to shit
Now I'm left here in the dust
With the taste of broken trustAnd I don't wanna walk away
But you left me no choice
Only talking to myself here
Now you muffled your voice
I'd rather have broken bones
And feel myself turn to stoneAaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quietI don't mind that I know that you're wrong
I don't mind that you think you're right

"Come on skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneerI tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right at the moment this order's tallAnd I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kindAnd in the morning, I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the finesCome on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the splitAnd I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kindAnd now all your love is wasted
Then who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your linesWho will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?Come on skinny love

"[Verse 1]
I'm sick to death of eating breakfast on my own
(Oooh)
Starting out my daily blues
I'm sick to death of spilling coffee on my phone
(Oooh)
Scrolling through pictures of you
I'd like to say that maybe we could work it out
Could I know that it's no use[Hook]
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that will do[Verse 2]
I kissed a stranger in the hallway on your floor
He was wearing purple shoes
I asked him when he'd kiss me, could he close his eyes?
But he just looked at me confused
And people say my expectations are too high
But I'm not asking for the moon[Hook]
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that will do
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that will do[Bridge]
Oh, I'm so sick of laying here
So sick of counting tears
Hate everyone but you
Oh, oh
Oh, I'm so sick of waiting here
So frustrated
My suspicions are you're laying there and thinking of me too[Verse 3]
I learned the lyrics yesterday to all your songs
But there was one I couldn't do
I think the lyric with
""You'll miss me when I'm gone""
We cut the cords I was confused
I'd ask you out and you can tell me where I'm wrong
But then I know you just refused[Hook]
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that will do
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that will do",birdy,Half As Good As You,http://www.metrolyrics.com/half-as-good-as-you-lyrics-tom-odell.html

You would break my heart
You are cruel, you are
But I'll keep loving you
I want you to know
I'm not perfect, so
I'm a rolling stone
But I'll keep loving youFor the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
Oh I will stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving youBut no, you can't see
I'm not what you need
My spirit's free
But I'll keep loving you
You are so wild
You've a restless mind
I won't renounce
But I'll keep loving youFor the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
Oh I will stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving youI'm only a man
I'll give you my love
But I make mistakes
'Cause it's in my blood
The world is so full
Of flaws and of rules

Will love you for youFor the rest of my life

To piece us back together
To tell you how it hurts.

You're standing in the way of the light?
Pour oil on these flames
Speed up my heart again

Does it have to be this hard?
We can stop the fighting
If you let down your guard

In spite of these comforting sounds you make.
I don't feel alright
Because you make promises that you break.
Into your house,
Why don't we share our solitude?
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude.It's hard to make sense,
Feels as if i'm sensing you through a lens.
If someone else comes,
I'll just sit here listening to the drums.
Previously i never called it solitude.
And probably you know all the dirty shows i've put on.
Blunted and exhausted like anyone.
Honestly i tried to avoid it. honestly.

Blurry bodies but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go I goI never thought a sunrise
Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight
Head spins like a carousel, over and over
Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right but I'm stillLost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go I goTwo more footsteps on the wood floor
But it ain't you
I'm faded so I bring someone home
Over and over, I do this and I'm stillLost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret

"We were so beautiful
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
Lost myself, seventeen
Then you came, found me
No other magic could ever compareThere's a room
In my heart with the memories we made
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames
There's no way I could ever forget, mmmFor as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
You, mmm
I will never not think about you
From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one
And no matter what I-I do, ooh, mmm
I will never not think about youWhat we had only comes
Once in a lifetime
For the rest of mine, always compareTo the room

Nights on fifth, inbetween B and A
There's no way I could ever forget, mmmFor as long as I live and as long as I love

Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one's listening
I nervously rehearse for when you're aroundAnd I keep waiting like you might change my mindWho wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fireBack and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
I'd rather lay forever right in this bedAnd I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more nightWho wrote the book on goodbye?

When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fireNo one knows (knows)
No one knows (knows)
We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in betweenWhat I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

"Home
Reflections of eyes shine bright in my mind, remind me
I long
to be cold and feel alive for that's what inspires me
Home
to be free, just to breathe
only seen in the eyes that know me
Home
like a dream, out of reach, I can't see through the film that clouds itMemories fade to dust
Slowly losing touchTo belong is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had
Now it's gone
to the plan for this
Home is where my heart is
Is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had
Now it's gone
to the plan for this
Home is where my heart isHome
Used to wish to be gone, to be far from the ones who choked me
Now
All I want is to hear, to be near, feel the moss around meMemories fade to grey
Take me to the placeWhere I belong
Is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had
Now it's gone
to the plan for this
Home is where my heart is
Is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had
Now it's gone
to the plan for this
Home is where my heart isI'm grateful for the chance that it's mine
So I change every second of timeTo belong

Wait till you get home
Sick of communicating
Over the telephone
Tell me how you feel
For I am lonely too
Need you to know
I'm just as cold and numb as youBut I could fly away
Or I could be no one
And you could be the sunshine falling
Over the mountains
Or you can come and stay
You could come right home
I don't see why I have to live this life
All aloneI could know
There is a way to make up for old mistakes
And I know whats happening is for a reason

To last demands

A vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest
Tells your new friends
I am a visitor here
I am not permanent
And the only thing
Keeping me dry isWhere I am (In this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am (Explaining that I am just visiting)

After the bars turn out their lights
And leave the autos swerving
Into the loneliest evening

And I wish that I was wiser

That make me feel so youngBut I dont know where this is going

And I can see by your smile
That you're glowing inside and out
Lets not pretend like its not what it is
When I'm just starting to realize
That I love you.And I wish that we were strangers
Strange enough to go unnoticed
from this crowdAnd I wish that we were closer
Close enough for me to hold you

become too long to bearBut I dont know where this is going

And I can see by your smile
That you're glowing, inside and out
Lets not pretend like its not what it is

There's an angel
And he's shaped like you, and I thought I knew him
There's a window
And it's dark inside, but the light was in it

I will not beg you to stay
I will move on and you should know I mean it
Wild horses run in meI remember
How we danced so close, I would stand on your feet
And the phone calls
That would last all night, they were lifeboats to me
Our fading scars are shooting stars
They're here, then goI will survive and be the one who's stronger
I will not beg you to stay
I will move on and you should know I mean it
Wild horses run in meA human hurts, forgets how strong they are
And they get lost along the way, hey
It's not giving up, it's letting go
And moving to a better placeI will survive and be the one who's stronger

My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head aroundWell, there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines
In pieces on the groundWell, I've seen fire and I've seen rain

"Fallen so far
Said you'd watch over my heart
Your love was so real
Too late to forget how you made me feelTell me what I was supposed to believe
Held me so close I could hardly breathe
And now I can't find how to let you go
You were mine but you've grown so coldSay it's all in my head
I remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Held me in the dark
Sheltered as you took my heart
I could never let you go, ooh
Say it's all in my head
Remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Oh, hold me in the dark
Sheltered as you take my heart
Take my heartKiss me, pretend
Tell me all your love lies again
Cast your shadows
Like how you said you'd catch me but let me goYou said I could have been free if I wanted to
I know you could see I was lost in you
Said you'd let me be if I wanted you to
And I know you'll leave but I don't want you toSay it's all in my head
I remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Held me in the dark
Sheltered as you took my heart
I could never let you go, ooh
Say it's all in my head
Remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Oh, hold me in the dark
Sheltered as you take my heart
Take my heartSo take my heart for your love
I'll let you break it, part every piece of me
So take my heart, it's all that's left

"Try to change your mind, it's like the weather
And you don't make my heart beat like you used to
I've been waiting for a sign
You've been saving all your lines
We could save each other for the better
And when you say my name, I'll be a memory
This is more than we had planned
Choices taken from our hands
Finally, this fades to stand aloneMy mind is a runaway
And I'll find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
I feel these growing pains
Have made us far too strong
We'll change if we want to change
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?You could lose yourself and search forever
Looking for the person that you'll never be
We've been trying to compensate
Time to learn from our mistakes
Maybe one day we'll fit back together
I'll pick up the pieces and we'll rearrange
Now we need to follow fate
Now we look the other way
Now we find the strength to stand aloneMy mind is a runaway

And I'll stand here if you prefer.

And you can tell the world
That you're tired.

Stuck in her daydream

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland

Tried to swim and stay afloat

Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets

"We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to dance this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?'Cause what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go and make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give me upHow unfair it's just our luck
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?'Cause what about, what about angels
They will come, they will go, make us special

Aaah AaahAnd we're stuck inside the silence
In a cold cold war
We're to proud to say we're sorry

So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercutRight now don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercutI find refuge in the distance
even when we're breaking down
Can we pause it just for one kiss?
Aaah AaahCause I never meant to hurt you
And I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to

So deep that we might not get back up

And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me

Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other sideSo when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me tooBut you gotta be there for me tooLast year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the endBut I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light

Need you on the other sideSo when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for youI got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me tooBut you gotta be there for me tooBoy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you?
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on youRunning, running just to keep my hands on you

And mama's good eats

So much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia, ah-ah
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia, ah-ahSwallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing timeMissing occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help but feel
I've lost what's mineYeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
So much history in my head

The ones that I've kept
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia, ah-ah
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia, ah-ahThey always say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
Yeah, they all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces, ohYeah, there's so much history in these streets

I've been running, running, runSo tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Cause I just wanna be at the start of after loving you
I plant my feet and I clench my teeth
I can't outrun what's coming after me
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming poolsBut I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there 'til I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out all the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming poolsI've been running, running, run

I've been running, running, run

Tell me how I'm gonna feel less secure when I look at you
So I close my eyes and just visualize
The greener skies on the other side
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming poolsBut I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there 'til I go through all of this pain

Still staring at you on my computer screen
Writing a fan fic in the middle of the night
Because, you know, this will bring us closer, right?

Shut the fuck up, bitch, do you want to die
I've told you before, are you deaf?
I've fallen in love with a gif
Otp, we're my otp
baby you and me
We'd be so sexy
Otp, we're my otp,
baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

Whatever floats your boat, what's your addiction?
And you, tumblr, you make it so much worse
You make me feel the feels, right where it hurts!
I'll love you always, I'll love you 5ever

Trying to kid myself
That I got my shit togetherSo go, get to runnin', won't you hurry?

Before I start to miss any part of this
And change my mind, whateverI say I wanna settle down

Shouldn't stay too long

And we never look back
And whatever I lack, you make upWe make a really good team
Though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry between usJump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichés on our own little tour
Let's rideYou don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need moneyAll I need is you
All I need is you, youWe try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easyAnd we take jokes way too far
'Cause sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
We are, we are, we areYou don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons

I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading doughPizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honourYou don't have to say I love you to say I love you

Has been eating at me
Trying to replace the love that I fake
With what we both needThe truth runs wild
Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate, my mind in its cage
And numb what I seeAwake, wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith and picture his face
Staring up at meWithout losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heavenThe truth runs wild

Trying to set straight the lines that I trace
To find some releaseThis voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to embrace the picture I paint
And colour me freeWithout losing a piece of me

Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?

You said: ""Light my cigarette""
So I lied to my mom and dad
And jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kissLong nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like youRemember when you taught me fate
Said it all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in mine
Next day, nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping things would change
But we went right back to your gameLong nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like youAnd even if I run away
And give our heart a harder day
Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for

Yeah, they always taste like you
You
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like youHeadlights, on me
